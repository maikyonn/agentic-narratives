    The movie title is {title} and the synopsis is: {synopsis}.  
    Please identify ONE (and only one) sentence in the summary as one of the five turning points.  
    You should have all and exactly five turning points in this order.  
    Additionally, the sentences you pull need to be in this order; 
    you should not choose a sentence for Climax which precedes the sentence you chose for Change of Plan, for example, because Climax comes after Change of Plan.
    The format of the output should be a JSON object with the turning points as keys and the sentence numbers as values.  
    Only output the JSON object. No need to explain why each is an appropriate selection.
