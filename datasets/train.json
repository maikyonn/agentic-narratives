        "synopsis": [
            "In 1987, Father Gabriele Amorth, the Pope's personal exorcist, an earthy, scooter-riding, humorous, practical man, visits an Italian village where a man is seemingly possessed by a demon.",
            "With the local priest, Amorth enters the room where the man is tied up.",
            "While exorcising him, using a Saint Benedict Medal sacramental, Amorth taunts the demon, challenging it to possess a pig; when it does, the pig is killed with a shotgun.",
            "This incident gets Amorth in trouble with a Church tribunal, since he acted without permission from superiors.",
            "One tribunal member is a friendly African Bishop, Lumumba, but another is a vicious American Cardinal, Sullivan, skeptical of demonic possession.",
            "Amorth replies that evil does exist and that he did not perform an actual exorcism but rather, some psychological theater to help the mentally ill man.",
            "Disgusted, Amorth walks out of the tribunal.",
            "The Pope assigns Amorth to visit a possessed boy named Henry in Spain.",
            "Henry, his mother Julia, and his rebellious teenage sister Amy had traveled from America to take possession of a mysterious old Spanish abbey, Julia's husband's sole bequest to his family after he died in a car accident where Henry was present.",
            "The traumatized Henry has not spoken since the accident.",
            "Following a sinister fire, workers who were restoring the abbey so the family could sell it, leave.",
            "Henry starts behaving bizarrely, and supernatural events unfold; serum chemistry panels and MRI show nothing abnormal.",
            "Diabolically possessed, Henry requests a priest; the local Father Tomas Esquibel arrives, but Henry obscenely derides him.",
            "Amorth arrives and enlists Esquibel as an assistant, though Esquibel is untrained as an exorcist.",
            "Esquibel has heard of Amorth but not read Amorth's books; Amorth believes they are good books.",
            "Amorth advocates the importance of prayer, though Esquibel makes mistakes as an assistant exorcist, including strangling Henry when Henry antagonizes him, mocking him for his sins.",
            "The duo attempt to exorcise Henry, without success, as he utters blasphemous phrases during the rite.",
            "Henry's demon even possesses Amy at times.",
            "Amorth finds Julia has not been a religious believer since childhood.",
            "Still, he convinces her to pray after she reveals that she believed that her guardian angel helped her in her youth.",
            "In Rome, the Pope becomes ill while reading documents about the Spanish case and is hospitalized.",
            "Amorth finds a well on the abbey grounds going down to a complex sealed off by the Church as demonically dangerous.",
            "He learns that a founder of the Spanish Inquisition, an exorcist, was possessed, which let him infiltrate the Church and do many evils.",
            "Amorth also finds the Church covered this up and eventually discovers the name of Henry's demon, Asmodeus, which will assist the exorcism.",
            "Amorth and Esquibel participate in the sacrament of Confession and Absolution, mutually confessing and absolving each other of their sins: that after Amorth, an Italian partisan, survived World War II and vowed to serve God in gratitude, a mentally ill woman asked for Amorth's help, and died by suicide when he did not help her due to pride; and Esquibel fornicated with a young woman he did not later marry.",
            "The two ready themselves; Amorth instructs Esquibel to wear a Miraculous Medal necklace.",
            "During the exorcism, they have horrible visions of the women whom they failed.",
            "The exorcism succeeds only when Amorth offers himself to be possessed, which chimes with Asmodeus's previously stating that he wants to destroy Amorth.",
            "Amorth tries to hang himself, but the demon doesn't allow it, preferring that Amorth infiltrate and destroy the Church.",
            "However, Esquibel helps Amorth drive away the demon and demonic appearances resembling the two women who troubled the men, successfully banishing Asmodeus back to Hell.",
            "The Pope does recover, as does Henry while the Vatican purchases and reconsecrates the abbey.",
            "The triumphant duo visit Rome and find Sullivan has taken leave in Guam, being replaced by Lumumba.",
            "Amorth and Esquibel are admitted to a special Church archive; Lumumba tells them they will be visiting 199 other evil sites, with the help of a map Amorth discovered at the abbey, to combat the Devil; Amorth jokes that he and Esquibel are going to Hell."

            "The Benefactor offers Kevin anything he wants so long as he works as one of his \"shifters\", people who have sold their souls and use \"shifting\" for transferring other people to alternate universes, thus making the transferees swap places with their doppelgangers in those other universes - all versions of Kevin from other realities already work as his \"shifters\"; what's more, Kevin's wife has already been \"shifted\" twice, without anything being noticed.",

            "He runs to Russo's cinema and together they are able to identify the other universe from which the view of Molly with the necklace originates; after feeding the coordinates into the deviator, Kevin is shifted to that universe.",
            "Molly in that universe is upset by conversation with Kevin, suggesting that they both should move on and reminding him that break-up of their marriage was initiated by him - but Kevin also feels that their relationship could be still revived.",

        "synopsis": [
            "In 2003, senior CIA official Donald Fitzroy visited a prisoner named Courtland Gentry in Florida.",
            "Eight years earlier, Courtland was a minor convicted of killing his abusive father to protect his brother.",
            "Fitzroy offers him his freedom in exchange for working as an assassin in the CIA's Sierra program.",
            "In 2021, Courtland, now known as Sierra Six, is working with fellow CIA agent Dani Miranda to assassinate a target named Dining Car suspected of selling off national security secrets in Bangkok during the national Songkran festival.",
            "Unable to do so stealthily without harming civilians, he attacks Dining Car directly, mortally wounding him.",
            "Before dying, he reveals he was also in the Sierra program as Sierra Four.",
            "He hands Six an encrypted drive detailing the corruption of CIA official Denny Carmichael, the lead agent on the assassination mission.",
            "Carmichael is elusive about the true purpose of the mission and the contents of the drive when confronted by Six, and Six refuses evacuation from Bangkok with Carmichael's men.",
            "Sending the drive to former Sierra Program handler Margaret Cahill in Prague, he calls a now-retired Fitzroy to request extraction.",
            "Carmichael hires mercenary Lloyd Hansen, a former CIA agent kicked out for his sociopathnic tendencies, to track down Six and retrieve the drive.",
            "Hansen does so by kidnapping Fitzroy's niece Claire, forcing Fitzroy to authorize Six's murder by the extraction team.",
            "However, Six kills them and escapes.",
            "Frustrated, Carmichael sends his subordinate Suzanne Brewer to oversee Hansen and keep him in line.",
            "Hansen keeps Claire hostage in a mansion in Croatia, at his base of operations.",
            "He also puts a massive bounty on Six's head to get mercenaries and assassins to hunt him down.",
            "Six heads to Vienna to find the serial number of Claire's pacemaker from Laszlo Sosa, but he betrays him for the bounty.",
            "Six escapes just as Hansen arrives with his team and kills Sosa, while Six kills all of Hansen's teammates and is rescued by Miranda from Hansen.",
            "Her reputation is shot thanks to the Bangkok mission and she initially plans to bring him in to salvage her CIA career.",
            "Six convinces her to drive him to Cahill's apartment in Prague, where she decrypts the drive.",
            "It reveals the extent of Carmichael's corruption on behalf of a mysterious benefactor working for a shadow government.",
            "Hansen sends several teams of assassins to Cahill, and the terminally ill Cahill blows up her home, so Six and Miranda can escape.",
            "Six is arrested and handcuffed in the square.",
            "A massive shootout in Prague resulted in all the police officers present slaughtered and Six escaped on a tram.",
            "After a long chase and gun battle, Six is once again saved by Miranda, in Cahill's bulletproof car.",
            "They infiltrate a hospital to track down Claire through her pacemaker's wireless signal.",
            "A Tamil mercenary, Avik San also known as \"Lone Wolf\" steals the drive from them, knocking them out, and bringing it to Hansen.",
            "Six and Miranda follow the pacemaker to Hansen's base.",
            "She creates a distraction while he infiltrates the mansion rescuing Fitzroy and Claire.",
            "Mortally wounded as they flee, Fitzroy sacrifices himself attempting to kill Hansen.",
            "Miranda knocks out Hansen's men, but Lone Wolf narrowly escapes.",
            "He defeats her in a fight, but gives her the drive, having become disgusted with Hansen's lack of morals and honour.",
            "Hansen takes Claire hostage and drags her into a hedge maze.",
            "After a standoff, he lets go of Claire and fights with Six.",
            "Before Six can kill him, Brewer shoots Hansen.",
            "She then tells Six that she plans to pin Carmichael's actions on Hansen to gain leverage over him.",
            "Furthermore, Brewer pledges for Claire's safety, but only if Six continues to work for the CIA.",
            "Six and Miranda are forced to cooperate in the cover-up, where ultimately no action is taken against Carmichael.",
            "After the debriefing at the CIA headquarters, Miranda threatens to kill Carmichael if any harm comes to Claire.",
            "Six escapes custody and frees Claire, who was being held at a secret location."
