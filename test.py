str = "### TASK COMPLETION\n\n1. **Identify the protagonist in the story**: The protagonist of the story is George Lawson, a 70-year-old man with a rich past as an educator.\n\n2. **First turning point (Opportunity)**: This occurs around sentence 4.5, which we can approximate by looking at sentences 4 and 5:\n   - Sentence 4: \"This curious volume, 'Rituals of the Omarians,' revealed the complex traditions of an African tribe lost to the sands of time.\"\n   - Sentence 5: \"George's curiosity was piqued by a chapter, decorated with the grandeur title of 'The Ceremonial Sacrifice'.\"\n   - **Protagonist's state**: At this point, George is curious and intrigued. His condition can be approximated as a 6 because he has discovered something interesting but hasn't yet committed to any action that would significantly alter his life.\n\n3. **Second turning point (Change of Plans)**: This occurs at sentence 7:\n   - Sentence 7: \"According to the arcane tome, various items were required for the ritual, ranging from elusive Amazonian forest roots to a hard-to-find 'Ga Noi,' a unique breed of Chinese gamefowl.\"\n   - **Protagonist's state relative to the first turning point**: George has now committed to conducting the ritual and is learning what it entails. His condition can be approximated as a 7 because he is taking action towards his goal, but the challenges are becoming apparent.\n\n4. **Third turning point (Point of commitment - approximating the role of \"Major Setback\" due to the narrative's progression)**: This occurs around sentence 16:\n   - Sentence 16: \"As things fall apart temporarily or permanently\" is not directly quoted from the text, but we see in sentence 15 and 16 the protagonist facing challenges: \n   - Sentence 15 isn't provided directly, so looking at sentence 16 for context: The narrative doesn't provide a direct quote for this turning point. However, considering the progression, George faces doubts or setbacks before fully committing.\n   - **Protagonist's state relative to the second turning point**: At this point, George might be facing self-doubt or the realization of the ritual's challenges. His condition can be approximated as a 4 because he is experiencing a setback or significant challenge.\n\n5. **Fourth turning point (Major Setback - actually functions more like the \"Point of Commitment\" in traditional story arcs)**: Given the narrative, this might be better represented by sentence 16.0, which indicates a moment of commitment rather than a setback:\n   - For clarity and progression, let's consider the actual event that signifies George moving past his doubts or fears: Sentence 19, \"George threw himself into preparing for the ritual with renewed vigor.\"\n   - **Protagonist's state relative to the third turning point**: This is actually an increase in commitment. However, given the instruction, if we were to identify a Major Setback based on the provided structure (and considering narrative flow), George's condition might have briefly dipped before this point of commitment. Let's approximate his condition as having briefly dropped to a 3 due to facing significant doubts or challenges.\n\n6. **Fifth turning point (Climax)**: This occurs around sentence 21.5, which we can approximate by looking at sentences 21 and 22:\n   - Sentence 21: \"The ritual was completed, and its effects began to manifest.\"\n   - **Protagonist's state relative to the fourth turning point**: After completing the ritual and seeing its positive outcomes, George's condition improves significantly. We can approximate his condition as a 9 because he has successfully overcome his challenges and achieved his goal.\n\n7. **List of protagonist's conditions at each turning point**:\n   - First turning point: 6\n   - Second turning point: 7\n   - Third turning point: 4\n   - Fourth turning point (considering the narrative flow and correcting for the task): 3 (briefly, before commitment) to 8 (after committing and overcoming doubts)\n   - Fifth turning point: 9\n\n   Corrected list considering the actual narrative progression and instruction clarity:\n   - 6, 7, 4, 8, 9\n\n8. **Classify the story arc type**: Given the progression from a state of curiosity (6) to interest and commitment (7), followed by facing challenges or doubts (4), then overcoming these with renewed commitment (8), and finally achieving success (9), this story follows the **Man in a Hole** archetype. The protagonist starts in a relatively neutral or positive state, falls into a dilemma (facing challenges and doubts about the ritual), and then finds a way out by committing to his goal and succeeding.\n\n9. **Determined story arc type**: Man in a Hole"
