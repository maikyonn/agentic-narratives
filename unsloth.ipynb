      "3. The letter offers a chance to reconnect in Miami, at the Mambo Cabana and for Andrés to finally confess his love for Marta through a song he wrote just for her.\n",
      "4. Vivo, happy with their life in Cuba, is reluctant to help Andrés.\n",
      "5. The next morning, Andrés dies in his sleep and that night, a funeral service is held in the plaza, with Andrés' niece-in-law Rosa and her daughter Gabi attending before they head back to their home in Key West, Florida.\n",
      "6. Ashamed of his earlier reluctance, Vivo vows himself to get Marta to hear Andrés' song.\n",
      "7. He stows away to Key West with Gabi and Rosa in their luggage.\n",
      "8. Gabi finds Vivo and agrees to help him deliver Andrés' song to Marta.\n",
      "9. Under the guise of attending a cookie sale in town, Gabi and Vivo purchase bus tickets to get to Marta's show, but they are stopped by the Sand Dollars, a girl scout troop who wants Vivo vaccinated.\n",
      "10. Gabi and Vivo escape from them, but miss the bus.\n",
      "11. They end up in the Everglades and are separated by a heavy rain storm, losing the song.\n",
      "12. While searching for Gabi, Vivo comes across a roseate spoonbill named Dancarino, who is unsuccessful in finding love with one of his own.\n",
      "13. With Vivo's help, he is able to win the heart of Valentina.\n",
      "14. The two later rescue Vivo from a Burmese python named Lutador.\n",
      "15. Meanwhile, Gabi discovers that she was followed by the Sand Dollars on a boat and that they have Andrés' song, keeping it from her until she leads them to Vivo.\n",
      "16. When the girls are attacked by Lutador, Vivo saves them, but the song is destroyed in the process.\n",
      "17. Devastated, Vivo considers returning to Cuba until he realizes he and Gabi can recreate the song, as he knows the melody and Gabi knows the lyrics.\n",
      "18. Together, they make it to Miami and search for Marta, who has learned of Andrés' death and refuses to go on stage.\n",
      "19. Gabi and Vivo sneak inside the Mambo Cabana, but Gabi is unable to enter and tells Vivo to go on without her.\n",
      "20. She is soon caught by security and her furious mother.\n",
      "21. Vivo finds a mourning Marta, who recognizes him from Andrés' obituary photo, and delivers the song.\n",

      "The story revolves around Vivo, a kinkajou who plays music with his owner Andrés in Havana, Cuba. After Andrés' death, Vivo decides to fulfill Andrés' dream of confessing his love to Marta Sandoval through a song. Vivo embarks on a journey from Cuba to Miami, facing various challenges and making new friends along the way, including Gabi, who helps him in his quest.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary of Each Segment and Character Development\n",
      "- **Vivo**: Begins as a reluctant participant in Andrés' plans but becomes the main character driven by guilt and a desire to fulfill Andrés' last wish. He faces numerous challenges, makes new friends, and learns about perseverance and friendship.\n",
      "- **Gabi**: Initially hesitant but then fully invests in helping Vivo. She learns valuable lessons about friendship, loyalty, and dealing with personal loss.\n",
      "- **Marta**: Introduced as the object of Andrés' affections, she is later revealed to be grieving Andrés' death. Through Vivo's efforts, she finds solace and decides to continue her music career.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Chain-of-Thought Explanation for Each Turning Point\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Opportunity (tp1): Sentence 3\n",
      "The opportunity turning point is defined as an introductory event that occurs after presenting the setting and background of the main characters. In sentence 3, Andrés receives a letter from Marta Sandoval, informing him about her retirement and inviting him to reconnect in Miami. This event sets the stage for the main action of the story by introducing a potential love interest for Andrés and a chance for him to confess his feelings through a song he wrote specifically for Marta. It presents an opportunity for Andrés to fulfill his personal goal, which later becomes Vivo's mission after Andrés' death.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Change of Plans (tp2): Sentence 6\n",
      "The change of plans turning point is where the main goal of the story is defined, starting the main action. In sentence 6, Vivo, feeling ashamed of his earlier reluctance to help Andrés, vows to get Marta to hear Andrés' song after Andrés' death. This marks a significant shift in the story as Vivo takes on the responsibility of fulfilling Andrés' dream, changing the direction of the narrative from a simple story of unrequited love to a journey of perseverance and friendship.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Point of No Return (tp3): Sentence 11\n",
      "The point of no return is an event that pushes the main character(s) to fully commit to their goal. In sentence 11, Gabi and Vivo end up in the Everglades and are separated by a heavy rain storm, losing the song. This event signifies a point where Vivo and Gabi face significant obstacles that test their commitment to their mission. Despite the setbacks, they continue their journey, indicating a full commitment to delivering the song to Marta, even if it means recreating it.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Major Setback (tp4): Sentence 15\n",
      "A major setback is an event where things fall apart temporarily or permanently. In sentence 15, the Sand Dollars attack Gabi and Vivo, leading to the destruction of the song. This event represents a significant setback as it seems to eliminate the possibility of fulfilling Andrés' wish through the original song. It forces Vivo and Gabi to reconsider their approach and find an alternative solution, making it a critical point in the story where their resolve is tested.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Climax (tp5): Sentence 21\n",
      "The climax is the final event or resolution of the main story. In sentence 21, Vivo delivers the recreated song to Marta, who is touched by it and decides to go on stage. This moment marks the culmination of Vivo's journey and the fulfillment of Andrés' dream. It's the most intense and critical point in the story as it resolves the main conflict (delivering the song to Marta) and sets the stage for the story's resolution, including the reunion of Gabi with her mother and Vivo finding a new home.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "In summary, the turning points in the story are:\n",
      "1. **Opportunity (tp1)**: Sentence 3 - Andrés receives an invitation from Marta, setting the stage for the main action.\n",
      "2. **Change of Plans (tp2)**: Sentence 6 - Vivo decides to fulfill Andrés' dream after his death.\n",
      "3. **Point of No Return (tp3)**: Sentence 11 - Gabi and Vivo face significant obstacles in the Everglades.\n",
      "4. **Major Setback (tp4)**: Sentence 15 - The song is destroyed during an attack by the Sand Dollars.\n",
      "5. **Climax (tp5)**: Sentence 21 - Vivo delivers the song to Marta, fulfilling Andrés' dream and resolving the main conflict.\n",
      "\n",
      "These turning points guide the narrative arc of the story, shaping the characters' journeys and the overall plot progression.\n",
