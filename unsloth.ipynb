      "### Input:\n",
      "Story, broken down into numbered sentences:\n",
      "            1) As the formidable grip of the Great Depression continues to take its toll, the teeming streets of 1930s New York City become the backdrop to a compelling narrative of resilience and survival against all odds.\n",
      "2) Introducing our protagonists, Jack Dempsey, an experienced and good-natured young man, along with his younger sister, Mary, who are orphaned by their father's tragic suicide following the loss of his prosperous coal business.\n",
      "3) Left to fend for themselves, they wrestle with the relentless poverty, surviving on scarce food and any charity they receive.\n",
      "4) The continuous burden of poverty pushes Jack to devise a daring plan to rob a midtown bank, hoping that such a dangerous act could offer them a brief respite from their unending ordeals.\n",
      "5) Opening up to Mary about his perilous scheme, her alarm and disapproval at his misguided solution spur a tense familial conflict that fuels the central narrative of the film.\n",
      "6) Unmoved by Mary's objections, Jack recruits his trusted accomplices from the crime-ridden neighborhood of Little Italy - Sal, a seasoned pickpocket with striking silver hair; Lily, a skillful lock-picker, and Eddie, a fast-talking impersonator.\n",
      "7) Creating moral tension, Mary, as the conscience of the narrative, vehemently urges Jack to abandon his dangerous plan, suggesting they rely on manual labor instead.\n",
      "8) Their clash of beliefs leads to a deeply emotional confrontation, highlighting their stark ideological differences and resulting in a painful rift between the siblings.\n",
      "9) Unshaken by Mary's opposition, Jack and his associates begin the meticulous preparation for the heist, acquiring various locksmithing tools, familiarizing themselves with the layout of the Midtown Bank, and closely monitoring the routines of its security staff.\n",
      "10) Tormented by the fear of losing her brother, Mary, betraying Jack's trust, tips off the local police about his planned robbery, securing a promise of her brother's safety in return.\n",
      "11) As the momentous event draws near, a palpable tension engulfs the city as Jack and his cohorts brace themselves for their moment of reckoning.\n",
      "12) Implementing their intricately planned operation, they confront and tactfully navigate through several unexpected obstacles.\n",
      "13) The tension peaks as they expertly evade security cameras, disarm alarm systems, cleverly manoeuvre through a host of traps, and distract security personnel to finally access the bank's treasury.\n",
      "14) The successful heist prompts a euphoric burst of joy amongst the downtrodden gang, their spirits momentarily soaring higher than New York's towering structures.\n",
      "15) However, the fleeting victory is quickly overshadowed as they find themselves encircled by heavily armed police officers, ensuing a high-stakes chase through the city's grimy, labyrinthine streets.\n",
      "16) In this unexpected showdown, a painful realization dawns upon Jack – they have been betrayed.\n",
      "17) Nonetheless, in a thrilling twist, Jack unveils his trump card – a covert passage leading straight into the city's expansive sewage network.\n",
      "18) A heart-stopping chase ensues as the gang sprints for the secret exit, with Jack bravely holding the police at bay, buying his comrades some precious time.\n",
      "19) They manage a hair-raising escape through the city’s underground network, leaving behind the echo of the blaring sirens and frantic shouts.\n",
      "20) Finding a secure hiding spot, Jack finally reveals his true motives: the stolen money is meant to provide relief for the city’s impoverished.\n",
      "21) As they distribute their unlawful gains, they bring a glimmer of hope to New York's lowest rungs, offering a momentary respite from the grim everyday existence.\n",
      "22) In a final act of redemption, Jack forgives Mary for her betrayal and shares a generous portion of the stolen funds with her.\n",
      "23) His accomplices, who've weathered numerous hardships, find themselves finally enjoying a life free from the terror of poverty and hunger.\n",
      "24) Observing from a safe distance, Jack watches his former partners and sister basking in their newfound security and happiness.\n",
      "25) Leaving them behind, Jack disappears into the shadowy alleyways of the city, resolved to start afresh alone.\n",
      "26) As the credits begin to roll, the viewers are left contemplating his actions – was his unconventional method simply a desperate bid for survival, or were they driven by a selfless desire to alleviate the suffering of others?\n",
      "27) As the credits begin to roll, the narrative leaves us pondering over the paradox of Jack’s actions - how even the darkest deeds, driven by an unwavering sense of humanity, can bring a beacon of light into the lives of those barely surviving.\n",

      "        ### RESPONSE\n",
      "        ### Task 1: Identify the Protagonist or Central Group of Characters\n",
      "The central characters in the story are Jack Dempsey and his younger sister, Mary. Jack is the primary protagonist, as the narrative revolves around his actions, decisions, and the consequences thereof. Mary plays a crucial role as well, often acting as the conscience of the story and influencing Jack's choices.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Task 2: Summarize Each Major Event and Explore How Those Events Change the Protagonist's Condition\n",
      "1. **Introduction to the Setting and Characters**: The story begins by setting the scene in 1930s New York City, amidst the Great Depression, and introduces Jack and Mary, who have been orphaned and are struggling to survive.\n",
      "2. **The Plan to Rob a Bank**: Jack devises a plan to rob a bank to temporarily alleviate their poverty, introducing conflict and setting the stage for the main action.\n",
      "3. **Recruitment of Accomplices**: Jack recruits Sal, Lily, and Eddie for the heist, marking a point of no return in their commitment to the plan.\n",
      "4. **Mary's Opposition and Betrayal**: Mary's disapproval and subsequent betrayal by tipping off the police create tension and raise the stakes, leading to a significant change in the protagonist's condition.\n",
      "5. **The Heist and Chase**: The successful bank robbery followed by a high-stakes chase introduces a major setback and tests the characters' resolve and ingenuity.\n",
      "6. **Escape and Revelation of Motives**: The gang's escape through the sewage network and Jack's revelation that the stolen money is to help the impoverished change the protagonist's condition by showing a shift towards redemption.\n",
      "7. **Redemption and New Beginnings**: The distribution of the stolen money, Jack's forgiveness of Mary, and the improvement in the lives of those around him mark a climax in the story, leading to a conclusion where the protagonist seeks a new beginning.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Task 3: Detailed Explanation of Each Ground Truth Turning Point\n",
      "1. **Opportunity (tp1): Sentence 4.0** - This sentence qualifies as the Opportunity turning point because it introduces the event that sets the main story in motion. Jack's decision to rob a bank is a direct response to their desperate situation, offering a potential way out of their poverty.

      "\n",
      "3. **Point of No Return (tp3): Sentence 10.0** - Mary's decision to tip off the police about the planned robbery marks the Point of No Return.

For Jack and his accomplices, the risk of being caught is now higher, and for Mary, the betrayal of her brother's trust has significant emotional implications, making this a point of commitment to their respective paths.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Major Setback (tp4): Sentence 15.0** - The event where the gang finds themselves encircled by heavily armed police officers after the heist is a Major Setback. This is the moment when things fall apart, and the characters face a significant obstacle that threatens their survival and the success of their plan. It tests their ability to respond under pressure and forces them to improvise to survive.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Climax (tp5): Sentence 21.0** - The distribution of the stolen money to provide relief for the city's impoverished marks the Climax of the story. This event is the culmination of the main action and resolves the central conflict. It reveals Jack's true motives and shows the positive impact of his actions, leading to a moment of redemption and change for the characters involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Task 4: Conclusion and Summary of Turning Points\n",
      "In summary, the turning points in the story, in order, are:\n",
      "- **Opportunity (tp1)**: Sentence 4.0 - Jack decides to rob a bank to alleviate their poverty.\n",

      "### Response:\n",
      "### Review of the Story\n",
      "The story revolves around Vivo, a kinkajou who plays music with his owner Andrés in Havana, Cuba. After Andrés' death, Vivo decides to fulfill Andrés' dream of confessing his love to Marta Sandoval through a song. Vivo embarks on a journey from Cuba to Miami, facing various challenges and making new friends along the way, including Gabi, who helps him in his quest.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary of Each Segment and Character Development\n",
      "- **Vivo**: Begins as a reluctant participant in Andrés' plans but becomes the main character driven by guilt and a desire to fulfill Andrés' last wish. He faces numerous challenges, makes new friends, and learns about perseverance and friendship.\n",
      "- **Gabi**: Initially hesitant but then fully invests in helping Vivo. She learns valuable lessons about friendship, loyalty, and dealing with personal loss.\n",
      "- **Marta**: Introduced as the object of Andrés' affections, she is later revealed to be grieving Andrés' death. Through Vivo's efforts, she finds solace and decides to continue her music career.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Chain-of-Thought Explanation for Each Turning Point\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Opportunity (tp1): Sentence 3\n",
      "The opportunity turning point is defined as an introductory event that occurs after presenting the setting and background of the main characters. In sentence 3, Andrés receives a letter from Marta Sandoval, informing him about her retirement and inviting him to reconnect in Miami. This event sets the stage for the main action of the story by introducing a potential love interest for Andrés and a chance for him to confess his feelings through a song he wrote specifically for Marta. It presents an opportunity for Andrés to fulfill his personal goal, which later becomes Vivo's mission after Andrés' death.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Change of Plans (tp2): Sentence 6\n",
      "The change of plans turning point is where the main goal of the story is defined, starting the main action. In sentence 6, Vivo, feeling ashamed of his earlier reluctance to help Andrés, vows to get Marta to hear Andrés' song after Andrés' death. This marks a significant shift in the story as Vivo takes on the responsibility of fulfilling Andrés' dream, changing the direction of the narrative from a simple story of unrequited love to a journey of perseverance and friendship.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Point of No Return (tp3): Sentence 11\n",
      "The point of no return is an event that pushes the main character(s) to fully commit to their goal. In sentence 11, Gabi and Vivo end up in the Everglades and are separated by a heavy rain storm, losing the song. This event signifies a point where Vivo and Gabi face significant obstacles that test their commitment to their mission. Despite the setbacks, they continue their journey, indicating a full commitment to delivering the song to Marta, even if it means recreating it.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Major Setback (tp4): Sentence 15\n",
      "A major setback is an event where things fall apart temporarily or permanently. In sentence 15, the Sand Dollars attack Gabi and Vivo, leading to the destruction of the song. This event represents a significant setback as it seems to eliminate the possibility of fulfilling Andrés' wish through the original song. It forces Vivo and Gabi to reconsider their approach and find an alternative solution, making it a critical point in the story where their resolve is tested.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Climax (tp5): Sentence 21\n",
      "The climax is the final event or resolution of the main story. In sentence 21, Vivo delivers the recreated song to Marta, who is touched by it and decides to go on stage. This moment marks the culmination of Vivo's journey and the fulfillment of Andrés' dream. It's the most intense and critical point in the story as it resolves the main conflict (delivering the song to Marta) and sets the stage for the story's resolution, including the reunion of Gabi with her mother and Vivo finding a new home.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "In summary, the turning points in the story are:\n",
      "1. **Opportunity (tp1)**: Sentence 3 - Andrés receives an invitation from Marta, setting the stage for the main action.\n",
      "2. **Change of Plans (tp2)**: Sentence 6 - Vivo decides to fulfill Andrés' dream after his death.\n",
      "3. **Point of No Return (tp3)**: Sentence 11 - Gabi and Vivo face significant obstacles in the Everglades.\n",
      "4. **Major Setback (tp4)**: Sentence 15 - The song is destroyed during an attack by the Sand Dollars.\n",
      "5. **Climax (tp5)**: Sentence 21 - Vivo delivers the song to Marta, fulfilling Andrés' dream and resolving the main conflict.\n",
      "\n",
      "These turning points guide the narrative arc of the story, shaping the characters' journeys and the overall plot progression.\n",
