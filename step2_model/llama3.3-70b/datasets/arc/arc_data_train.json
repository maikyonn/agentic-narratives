        "output": "### TASK 1: Identify the protagonist and 5 major events in the story\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Jake, a worn-out detective, and his partner Alex, an overzealous young detective. However, since the story arc classification is typically applied to a single protagonist or a cohesive unit, we can consider Jake and Alex as a duo protagonist for the purpose of this analysis.\n\nThe 5 major events in the story are:\n1. The introduction of the serial murder case (sentence 3).\n2. The duo's investigation uncovers the city's social underbelly, and Alex becomes entangled in a dangerous spiral of gambling addiction (sentence 9).\n3. Jake and Alex bridge their differences and form a reluctant alliance to solve the case (sentence 12).\n4. They discover a puzzling hint that leads them to predict the mayor could be the murderer's next target (sentence 15).\n5. The duo successfully prevents the assassination of the mayor and apprehends the true culprit (sentences 18-21).\n\n### TASK 2: Describe the protagonist's state and how it changed relative to the previous events\n\n1. **Introduction of the serial murder case**: The duo protagonist (Jake and Alex) is in a state of professional stagnation and personal struggle. Jake is worn out, and Alex is overzealous but inexperienced. Their condition is relatively low due to the challenging case and their personal demons.\n2. **Investigation and Alex's addiction**: The protagonist's state worsens as Alex falls into a dangerous spiral of gambling addiction, and they face derision from their peers. This event lowers their condition further due to internal and external pressures.\n3. **Forming a reluctant alliance**: The duo's state begins to improve as they bridge their differences and work together more effectively. This marks a turning point where their condition starts to rise as they become more cohesive and determined.\n4. **Predicting the mayor's assassination**: The protagonist's state becomes more urgent and focused. They have made progress in the case and are now driven to prevent a significant crime. Their condition has improved from the previous low points.\n5. **Apprehending the true culprit**: The duo's state reaches its highest point as they successfully solve the case, prevent the mayor's assassination, and bring the perpetrator to justice. This event marks a significant improvement in their condition, both professionally and personally.\n\n### TASK 3: Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain your reasoning\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the narrative. Initially, the duo protagonist is in a relatively low state due to personal and professional challenges. As the story progresses, they face further setbacks, such as Alex's addiction and the criticism from their peers, which worsen their condition. However, they then experience a series of improvements: forming a stronger partnership, making significant progress in the case, predicting and preventing the mayor's assassination, and finally apprehending the culprit. This pattern of falling into a dilemma (or multiple dilemmas) and then finding a way out, ending in a better state than at the beginning, aligns with the **Man in a Hole** story arc type.\n\n### TASK 4: Determine the story arc type\n\nMan in a Hole"

Description of Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1 (Receiving the invitation):** Amelia is in a state of intrigue and curiosity. Her condition is one of mild interest, not significantly altered from her usual state but with a spark of excitement.\n- **Event 2 (Deciding to attend):** Amelia's state changes to one of cautious excitement, leaning on Peter for support. This indicates a slight improvement in her condition as she begins to step out of her comfort zone.\n- **Event 3 (Series of misunderstandings):** Amelia's state becomes one of active participation and amusement, despite initial apprehensions. Her condition improves further as she enjoys the absurdity of the situation.\n- **Event 4 (Revelation of the prank):** Initially, Amelia feels a rush of disappointment, indicating a downturn in her condition. However, this is short-lived.\n- **Event 5 (Forgiving Peter and writing the cover story):** Amelia's state transforms into one of joy, forgiveness, and newfound enthusiasm for life. Her condition significantly improves as she finds satisfaction and laughter in her experience.\n\n### 3. Classification of Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the story. Initially, Amelia is in a relatively stable state (as the editor-in-chief), then she faces a series of challenges and uncertainties (the mysterious invitation, the party, and the revelation of the prank), which could be seen as a \"hole\" or a dilemma. However, she navigates these challenges, finds amusement and joy in them, and ultimately ends in a better state than where she began, having stepped out of her comfort zone and found a new lease on life.\n\nThis progression\u2014facing a dilemma and finding a way out, ending better than at the beginning\u2014aligns with the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc type. The key characteristic of this arc is the protagonist's journey from a lower or troubled state to a higher or resolved state, which is exactly what Amelia experiences.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Emily, a teenage girl who aspires to pursue a career in English Literature. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Emily returns home to help manage her father's struggling hardware store** (sentence 4), after withdrawing from her English Literature course due to unaffordable student loans.\n2. **Emily meets Alex in Golden Gate Park** (sentence 7), which marks the beginning of a relationship that inspires her and offers emotional support.\n3. **Emily's blog attracts the notice of Maverick Publishing House** (sentence 14), presenting her with an opportunity to pursue her literary dreams.\n4. **Emily's father discovers her secret blog, leading to a heated argument and Emily being dismissed from the store** (sentences 16-18), which puts Emily in a difficult position between her familial obligations and her personal aspirations.\n5. **Emily decides to embark on the Maverick book deal and later finds success with her book, leading to reconciliation with her father and a stronger relationship with Alex** (sentences 21-26), culminating in Emily finding her place in the world and discovering her authentic self.\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Emily's state is one of disappointment and obligation. She has had to withdraw from her desired course of study and return home, indicating a low point in her pursuit of personal and professional goals.\n- **Event 2**: Meeting Alex improves Emily's state, as she finds solace and happiness in their budding relationship. This marks a positive change from her previous state of disappointment.\n- **Event 3**: The opportunity with Maverick Publishing House further elevates Emily's state, offering her a chance to pursue her literary dreams and potentially improve her financial situation. This is another positive change.\n- **Event 4**: The argument with her father and being dismissed from the store puts Emily in a state of distress and uncertainty. This is a negative change from her previously ascending trajectory, as she now faces a significant setback.\n- **Event 5**: Emily's decision to pursue the book deal, her subsequent success, and the reconciliation with her father mark a significant improvement in her state. She achieves personal and professional success, and her relationships are strengthened. This is a positive change and the highest point in the story for Emily.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story follows a pattern where the protagonist, Emily, starts in a disadvantaged situation (withdrawing from college due to financial constraints), experiences a series of events that include both positive developments (meeting Alex, the blog opportunity) and setbacks (conflict with her father, dismissal from the store), and ultimately ends in a much better situation (achieving literary success, reconciling with her father, and strengthening her relationship with Alex). This pattern indicates that Emily's condition improves significantly from the start to the end of the story, despite facing setbacks along the way.\n\nGiven the descriptions of the story arcs provided, Emily's journey aligns closely with the **Cinderella** story arc type. This type is characterized by the protagonist rising, facing a setback, and ultimately achieving a higher state. Emily's rise begins with her meeting Alex and finding inspiration for her blog, she faces a setback with her father's discovery of her blog and the subsequent argument, and she ultimately achieves a higher state with her literary success and the resolution of her personal relationships.\n\n### 4.

Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: Lomito-Smith's state is one of caution and professionalism as she returns to duty. Her condition is neutral, with a slight disadvantage due to her recent altercation.\n- **Event 2**: Lomito-Smith's state worsens as she discovers Ganning's body and the circumstances of his death. She is now in a dilemma, seeking justice and truth.\n- **Event 3**: Her state improves slightly as she uncovers the truth about Demarco's death, giving her a sense of purpose and vindication. However, this also puts her in greater danger.\n- **Event 4**: Lomito-Smith's state becomes more dangerous and precarious as she confronts corrupt officers. She faces a significant risk to her life and career.\n- **Event 5**: Ultimately, Lomito-Smith's state improves as she sees justice served through Demarco's spirit and finds a sense of peace and closure, both for herself and Taneesha.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the protagonist's condition throughout the story, it can be observed that Officer Lomito-Smith faces multiple dilemmas and recoveries. Initially, she is in a somewhat disadvantaged position returning to duty after an altercation. She then falls into a deeper dilemma upon discovering the truth about her colleagues' misconduct and the supernatural events surrounding it. However, she recovers and finds a new sense of purpose in uncovering the truth and seeking justice. This cycle repeats as she faces greater dangers and eventually finds a form of resolution and peace.\n\nThe story arc that best fits this pattern is the **Double Man in a Hole**, where the protagonist faces two cycles of dilemma and recovery. Lomito-Smith's journey involves falling into a hole (discovering the corruption and supernatural threat), recovering (uncovering the truth and finding a way to confront it), falling into another hole (facing direct danger from corrupt officers), and finally recovering (finding peace and justice).\n\n### 4.

Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Bailey starts in a position of unexpected responsibility as the techno-manager of The Pelicans, despite her lack of dancing skills. Her state is one of initial acceptance and potential.\n- **Event 2**: Bailey's state worsens as she is rejected and evicted from the team, leading to feelings of dismay and questioning her contributions.\n- **Event 3**: There's a shift as The Pelicans recognize Bailey's value, leading to an improvement in her state as she is sought after again.\n- **Event 4**: Bailey's state improves further as her innovative idea is accepted, and she becomes integral to the team's strategy for success.\n- **Event 5**: Bailey's state reaches its highest point as The Pelicans win the championship, and her contributions are widely acknowledged, leading to her acceptance and acclaim.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on the pattern of the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. The protagonist starts in a relatively positive position (as part of the team), faces a significant setback (being evicted), and then rises to an even higher state (being sought after again, contributing significantly, and achieving success). This pattern mirrors the **Cinderella** story arc type, where the protagonist faces a setback but ultimately achieves a higher state than before. The key elements are the initial rise (Bailey's involvement with the team), the fall (being evicted), and the final rise to success and recognition (the team's victory and Bailey's acclaim).\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To analyze the story arc type, let's break down the task into the requested steps.\n\n### 1. Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\n\nThe protagonists in this story are Dylan Hendricks and his partner Naomi O'Sullivan, as the story revolves around their experiences and personal growth. However, for the sake of simplicity and focus, we can consider Dylan as the primary protagonist to analyze the story arc.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n- **Event 1:** Dylan and Naomi purchase a secluded estate in Montana to escape their addiction struggles and city life (Sentence 2).\n- **Event 2:** They discover an undisclosed rustic cabin on their property and learn that Eddie Thornton, a former heroin addict, has been living there (Sentences 4-6).\n- **Event 3:** Despite initial disruptions, Dylan and Naomi find common ground with Eddie and learn about his past and his path towards recovery, forging an unexpected connection (Sentences 15-19).\n- **Event 4:** Eddie is abducted by a local biker gang seeking his hidden collectibles, prompting Dylan and Naomi to embark on a mission to rescue him (Sentence 20).\n- **Event 5:** They successfully rescue Eddie, and this shared adventure strengthens their bond, leading to a newfound sense of family and fulfillment (Sentences 22-24).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **At Event 1:** Dylan is struggling with substance addiction and legal dilemmas, seeking solace and rehabilitation. His state is one of desperation and hope for a better life.\n- **At Event 2:** The discovery of Eddie and his cabin introduces uncertainty and potential conflict into Dylan's life, complicating his pursuit of a serene and rehabilitative environment. His state becomes more complex, with a mix of frustration and curiosity.\n- **At Event 3:** Dylan finds common ground with Eddie, and through shared experiences and stories, he begins to reconcile with his own addiction history. His state improves as he finds support and understanding, facilitating his recovery.\n- **At Event 4:** The abduction of Eddie introduces a crisis, placing Dylan in a state of urgency and concern for someone he has come to care about. This event tests his resolve and prompts action.\n- **At Event 5:** After rescuing Eddie, Dylan experiences a sense of fulfillment and solidarity, having formed a unique family bond with Eddie and Naomi. His state is one of triumph, connection, and a deeper sense of recovery and purpose.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the analysis, Dylan's condition throughout the story starts at a low point (struggling with addiction), faces complications and challenges (discovery of Eddie and his abduction), but ultimately ends on a higher note (finding connection, rescuing Eddie, and achieving a sense of family and fulfillment). This pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (or multiple dilemmas) but finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning.\n\n### 4.

Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc can be classified by analyzing the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. Initially, Miller is tasked with a challenging mission, placing him in a neutral state. As complications arise (Event 2), his state declines. However, with Leyla's help (Event 3) and their subsequent planning and execution (Events 4 and 5), Miller's state improves, culminating in the successful completion of his mission.\n\nThis pattern reflects a protagonist who faces a dilemma (the complicated mission), finds a way out with the help of an ally, and ends in a better state than at the beginning (having successfully completed the mission against the odds).

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Cherie, a young single mother and pre-law student. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. Cherie agrees to go to dinner with Ethan, a client of her boss, after her boss cancels on him due to an anniversary dinner (sentences 2-5).\n2. Ethan attacks Cherie after she spends the evening with him, leading to her fleeing for her life (sentence 10).\n3. Cherie discovers that Ethan is a fallen angel who has been controlling men throughout history and that she is part of a larger plan to stop him (sentences 38-40).\n4. Cherie agrees to be used as bait to lure Ethan out so that he can be defeated, leading to a final confrontation (sentences 40-43).\n5. Cherie and the women from the spa defeat Ethan by exposing him to sunlight and then killing him (sentences 44-47).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: At the beginning, Cherie is in a somewhat stable but possibly unfulfilling situation, working as a secretary and being a single mother. Her decision to go to dinner with Ethan sets off a chain of events that will significantly alter her life.\n- **Event 2**: After Ethan's attack, Cherie's state worsens dramatically. She is frightened, injured, and on the run, indicating a sharp decline in her condition from the initial event.\n- **Event 3**: When Cherie learns about Ethan's true nature, her state could be seen as one of knowledge acquisition but still under threat. She understands the danger she's in but also starts to see a way out with the help of Dinah and the other women.\n- **Event 4**: Cherie's decision to be used as bait shows a shift towards empowerment and proactivity. Despite the danger, she is taking steps to confront her attacker and regain control of her life, indicating an improvement in her state.\n- **Event 5**: Finally, with Ethan's defeat, Cherie's state improves significantly. She has overcome her attacker, found support and allies, and can return to her life with a sense of victory and safety.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the progression of Cherie's state throughout the story, it starts with her in a relatively stable but unfulfilling situation, then sharply declines as she faces danger and attack, followed by a period of recovery and empowerment as she learns more about her attacker and decides to take action. This culminates in her ultimate victory over Ethan, which significantly improves her condition from where she started.\n\nThe story arc that best fits this description is the \"Man in a Hole\" arc. This arc is characterized by the protagonist falling into a dilemma (Cherie being attacked and pursued by Ethan) and then finding a way out, ultimately ending in a better state than at the beginning (Cherie defeating Ethan and securing her safety).\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identification of Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Sarah Thompson, a lifestyle blogger living in Brooklyn, New York. The five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Discovery of the Fujifilm**: Sarah finds a dust-covered, antiquated roll of Fujifilm at a flea market, which reveals images of heinous crimes in her neighborhood (sentence 3).\n2. **Shift in Blog Theme**: Sarah changes the theme of her blog to investigate these local crimes, surprising her followers (sentence 4).\n3. **Narrow Escape from Attack**: Sarah narrowly escapes a covert attack after visiting a warehouse implicated in her investigation (sentence 7).\n4. **Live Event on Instagram**: Sarah and her husband James hold a live event on Instagram, revealing evidence and identifying the criminals (sentence 10).\n5. **Resolution and New Beginning**: The live event leads to law enforcement capturing the criminals, and Sarah decides to use her platform for social justice and environmental issues (sentences 11-12).\n\n### 2. Description of Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Discovery of the Fujifilm)**: Sarah's state changes from peaceful and serene to intrigued and alarmed. She moves from a state of ignorance about the crimes in her neighborhood to being aware and concerned.\n- **Event 2 (Shift in Blog Theme)**: Sarah's state transitions from being merely a lifestyle blogger to an investigative blogger, which surprises her followers. This shift indicates her commitment to uncovering the truth about the crimes, showing a proactive and determined state.\n- **Event 3 (Narrow Escape from Attack)**: Sarah's state becomes one of fear and vulnerability. The attack makes her realize the danger of her investigations, potentially making her question her decision to pursue the story.\n- **Event 4 (Live Event on Instagram)**: Sarah's state shows resilience and courage. Despite the previous attack and the danger, she decides to go public with her findings, indicating a strong determination to see justice served.\n- **Event 5 (Resolution and New Beginning)**: Sarah's state evolves to one of empowerment and purpose. She not only helps in capturing the criminals but also decides to expand her platform's focus to include social justice and environmental issues, showing growth and a newfound sense of responsibility.\n\n### 3. Classification of Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, it can be observed that Sarah starts in a good state (as a successful blogger), falls into a dilemma (upon discovering the crimes and facing danger), and then finds a way out (by successfully exposing the criminals and deciding to use her platform for greater good). This pattern aligns with the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist faces a problem, hits a low point, and then recovers to an even better state than before. Sarah's journey from being a lifestyle blogger to becoming an advocate for social justice, coupled with her personal growth and the strengthening of her relationship with her husband, demonstrates this arc. She ends up in a better state than where she started, having grown both personally and professionally.\n\n### 4. Determined Story Arc Type\n\nMan in a Hole"

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story can be considered as Kelsa, given that the narrative revolves significantly around her experiences, struggles, and emotional journey as a transgender high school student. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n- Event 1: Kelsa and Khal begin to develop a mutual attraction in their art class (sentence 5).\n- Event 2: Khal decides to act on his feelings and gives flowers to Kelsa at lunch, publicly declaring his interest (sentence 11).\n- Event 3: Kelsa and Khal decide to go for a relationship despite the risk of losing friends, marking a significant commitment to each other (sentence 14).\n- Event 4: Kelsa faces a severe setback when she is banned from the women's locker rooms and bathrooms due to fabricated accusations by Em and Otis (sentence 24).\n- Event 5: Kelsa and Khal reconcile after overcoming several challenges, including social stigma, personal insecurities, and external obstacles, and they eventually part amicably as Kelsa prepares to leave for college (sentences 32-35).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Kelsa's state is one of cautious exploration, as she begins to develop feelings for Khal. This marks an improvement from her initial state of secrecy and potential loneliness.\n- **Event 2**: Kelsa's state improves further as she receives public acknowledgment of Khal's feelings, indicating a move towards openness and acceptance.\n- **Event 3**: This event signifies a peak in Kelsa's state, as she and Khal commit to their relationship despite potential backlash, showing courage and determination.\n- **Event 4**: Kelsa's state worsens significantly as she faces discrimination and isolation, being banned from the women's locker rooms and bathrooms, and dealing with rumors and misunderstandings.\n- **Event 5**: Kelsa's state recovers as she and Khal reconcile, and she finds a sense of closure and growth. Although they part ways, it's on amicable terms, and Kelsa seems more confident and prepared for her future.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the analysis, Kelsa's journey can be seen as starting from a place of vulnerability and secrecy, rising to a point of openness and commitment, facing a significant downfall due to external and internal challenges, and then recovering to a state of growth and acceptance. This pattern aligns with the **Oedipus** story arc type, which involves a protagonist starting high, falling, recovering, and then facing another significant downfall, but in Kelsa's case, the final state is one of recovery and personal growth rather than a downfall.\n\nThe Oedipus arc is characterized by a rise, a fall, a recovery, and sometimes another fall. In Kelsa's story, the rise is her blossoming relationship with Khal and her decision to be open about it. The fall is the discrimination and personal challenges she faces afterward. The recovery is her reconciliation with Khal, finding support, and ultimately parting on good terms as she moves forward with her life.\n\n### 4. Determined Story Arc Type\n\nOedipus"

Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain your reasoning\n\nThe story arc of Tom's journey can be classified by analyzing the progression of his state throughout the major events. Initially, Tom is in a state of discontent and dreaming of change (low point). Upon finding the pocket watch and being transported to Dunmore East, he begins to live out his dreams and takes action against injustices (rise). He faces challenges, including the battle against Maev, but ultimately succeeds in his endeavors (peak). After being returned to his real life, instead of succumbing to his previous state of stagnation, Tom is inspired to make positive changes, indicating a growth and an improvement in his condition (higher state than the beginning).\n\nThis pattern follows the **Cinderella** story arc, where the protagonist rises from a low point, faces setbacks, but ultimately achieves a higher state. Tom's journey from a dissatisfied telemarketer to a brave hero and finally to a personally and professionally fulfilled individual mirrors this arc. He experiences a significant rise in his condition as he navigates through challenges and emerges victorious and changed, applying his experiences to better his real life.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To analyze the story arc, let's first identify the protagonist and major events in the story.\n\n1. **Protagonist Identification and Major Events:**\n   - The protagonist of the story can be considered as Krista, given that the story concludes with her finding a sense of closure, which suggests her emotional journey is a central focus.\n   - Five major events in the story are:\n     1. Krista meets Nito at a party (sentence 7), marking the beginning of their relationship.\n     2. Nito is arrested after fighting off a man who tried to grab Krista (sentence 10), showing Krista's concern for Nito and her involvement in his life.\n     3. Krista and Nito share a kiss (sentence 14), indicating a deepening of their relationship.\n     4. Nito is fatally shot by Adam (sentence 20), which is a tragic event directly affecting Krista.\n     5. Krista confronts Adam and ensures he is detained (sentences 25-27), leading to her finding closure.\n\n2. **Protagonist's State at Each Event:**\n   - **Event 1 (Krista meets Nito):** Krista's state is one of curiosity and openness, as she is interested in Nito after watching his skateboarding videos online. This is a positive, hopeful state.\n   - **Event 2 (Nito is arrested):** Krista's state becomes one of worry and possibly guilt for not being able to prevent Nito's arrest. This is a slightly negative state compared to the previous event.\n   - **Event 3 (Krista and Nito share a kiss):** Krista's state improves to one of happiness and connection, as her relationship with Nito deepens. This is a positive state.\n   - **Event 4 (Nito is fatally shot):** Krista's state drastically worsens to one of grief, shock, and possibly anger. This is a very negative state.\n   - **Event 5 (Krista confronts Adam):** Krista's state changes to one of determination and ultimately closure, as she takes action against Adam and finds a way to deal with her grief. This is a more positive state than the previous event, indicating recovery.\n\n3. **Story Arc Classification:**\n   - The story starts with Krista in a hopeful state, then faces setbacks (Nito's arrest, his death), but ultimately rises to a state of closure and empowerment (confronting Adam). This pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist faces challenges, falls into a difficult situation, but then recovers to a better state than before the challenges began.\n   - Given this pattern, the story most closely follows the **Cinderella** arc, where the protagonist rises, faces a setback, and ultimately achieves a higher state. Krista's journey from meeting Nito, experiencing the tragedy of his death, and then finding closure by confronting Adam mirrors this arc. The **Cinderella** story arc is characterized by an initial rise, a fall, and then a final rise to an even higher point, which aligns with Krista's emotional and empowerment journey throughout the story.\n\n4. **Determined Story Arc Type:**\nCinderella"

Isabel's journey from a rebellious and frustrated teenager to a courageous leader who brings about change and resolves her personal conflicts fits this arc.

Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonists in this story are Queen Nefertiti and priest Amenhotep, as the narrative revolves around their forbidden love and the consequences that follow. However, for the purpose of analyzing the story arc, we will consider their joint experiences as the focal point.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. The introduction of the royal couple and the priest, setting the stage for the story (sentences 1-3).\n2. The discovery of the secret affair by a local tradesman, leading to chaos and the pursuit of Amenhotep (sentences 10-14).\n3. The lovers' daring escape from Thebes, aided by Nefertiti's bravery and Amenhotep's knowledge of the city (sentences 17-22).\n4. The decision to return to Thebes and confront King Akhenaten, marking a turning point in their fate (sentences 26-27).\n5. The final resolution, where King Akhenaten grants them exile, and they find peace in a new home (sentences 30-44).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1 (Introduction):** The protagonists are introduced in a state of high social standing but with underlying tension and forbidden love. Nefertiti is in a loveless marriage, and Amenhotep is bound by his priestly duties. Their state is one of hidden desire and compliance with societal norms.\n  \n- **Event 2 (Discovery of the Affair):** Their state drastically worsens as they face the consequences of their discovered affair. They go from being respected members of society to being fugitives, with Amenhotep being pursued by the king's guards. This marks a significant downfall in their social standing and personal safety.\n\n- **Event 3 (Escape from Thebes):** Although they manage to escape, their state remains precarious. They are on the run, facing dangers from both the desert and their pursuers. However, they are together, which gives them a sense of hope and freedom.\n\n- **Event 4 (Return to Thebes):** Deciding to return and face King Akhenaten is a brave move that shows their determination to be together and challenge societal norms. Their state is one of resolve and bravery, but also uncertainty about their future.\n\n- **Event 5 (Final Resolution):** Ultimately, they are granted exile, which allows them to start a new life together, free from the constraints of Thebes. This marks a significant improvement in their state, as they achieve a peaceful existence, freedom to love each other openly, and a chance to rebuild their lives.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nAnalyzing the protagonist's condition throughout the story:\n- They start in a high social standing but with personal unfulfillment (Event 1).\n- Face a significant downfall upon the discovery of their affair (Event 2).\n- Show resilience and bravery in their escape and decision to return (Events 3 and 4).\n- Ultimately achieve a higher state of personal fulfillment and peace in their exile (Event 5).\n\nThis pattern follows the **Cinderella** story arc type, where the protagonist rises, faces a setback, and ultimately achieves a higher state. The initial high social standing, followed by a drastic fall, and then a brave comeback to achieve a peaceful and loving life, aligns with the Cinderella arc.\n\n### 4.

John meets Susan at a church gathering, and they form a deep bond (sentence 13).\n4. Susan reveals her battle against a life-threatening illness (sentence 16).\n5. Susan's demise and John's subsequent transformation into a newly-ordained pastor (sentences 20-25).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Financial Crisis):** John's state changes from one of wealth and high status to one of loss and uncertainty. He loses his wealth, his wife leaves him, and he is left alone.\n- **Event 2 (Meeting Paul):** John's state begins to shift from despair towards hope. He starts on a path of spiritual awakening, which marks the beginning of his personal growth.\n- **Event 3 (Meeting Susan):** John's state improves further as he finds companionship and a deep emotional connection with Susan. This relationship brings him peace and understanding.\n- **Event 4 (Susan's Illness):** John's state becomes one of concern and sadness. He is torn by the impending loss of Susan, which challenges his newfound faith and peace.\n- **Event 5 (Susan's Demise and John's Transformation):** Despite the grief, John's state ultimately becomes one of strength and purpose. He finds a way to transcend his pain by dedicating his life to serving others, culminating in him becoming a pastor.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story follows a pattern where the protagonist, John, starts in a high position (as a successful attorney), faces a significant downfall (financial crisis and loss of his previous life), and then rises to an even higher state (finding spiritual awakening, forming a deep connection with Susan, and eventually becoming a pastor). This pattern resembles the **Cinderella** story arc, where the protagonist rises, faces a setback, and ultimately achieves a higher state. John's journey is marked by his initial success, his fall into hardship, his spiritual awakening, and his ultimate rise to a state of profound personal and spiritual fulfillment.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Charlie, the affable baker who is known for his daydreaming disposition, especially when thoughts of his lady-love Rose come to mind. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Charlie hears about the unfortunate fate befalling Rose's family estate** (sentence 5): This event sets the stage for Charlie's journey, as he learns about the problem that needs to be solved.\n2. **The entire town learns about Deveraux's takeover of Serenity Manor** (sentence 6): This event escalates the situation, making it a community issue and raising the stakes for Charlie and his friends.\n3. **Charlie and his friends decide to infiltrate the manor to steal back the manor and the 'Duchess's Tear'** (sentence 10): This marks a turning point where Charlie and his friends take action, deciding to tackle the problem head-on.\n4. **The group faces a surprise twist when Deveraux leaves the gala prematurely** (sentence 24): This event introduces a complication, testing the group's ability to adapt and continue with their plan.\n5. **The group successfully retrieves the Duchess's Tear and exposes Deveraux's crimes** (sentences 28-30): This final event concludes the story on a high note, with Charlie and his friends achieving their goal and finding personal triumphs.\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Charlie's state changes from comfortable to worried upon hearing about Rose's family estate. His concern for Rose and her family's situation sets him on a path of action.\n- **Event 2**: As the news spreads, Charlie's worry deepens, but he is also motivated by the community's outrage, potentially making him more determined to act.\n- **Event 3**: Charlie's decision to take matters into his own hands marks a significant shift from being reactive to proactive. His state changes from passive worry to active engagement.\n- **Event 4**: The unexpected twist introduces uncertainty and raises the stakes, potentially causing Charlie anxiety or doubt. However, this also tests his resolve and ability to adapt.\n- **Event 5**: Successfully achieving their goal, Charlie's state changes to one of triumph and relief. He not only solves the problem but also finds personal growth and possibly romantic fulfillment.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the progression of Charlie's state throughout the story, it's clear that he starts in a comfortable position, falls into a dilemma (upon learning about Rose's family estate and Deveraux's actions), and then finds a way out through his actions and the support of his friends. The story arc type that best fits this narrative is the **Man in a Hole** because Charlie initially faces a problem (the hole), then works his way out of it through determination and action, ending in a better state than where he began. This arc is characterized by a protagonist who faces a significant challenge, struggles through it, and emerges victorious and often personally transformed.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\n\nThe protagonist in the story is Jake Sanders, an ex-Navy SEAL. Five major events in the story are:\n1. Jake leads his squad in rescuing a high-value hostage from enemy combatants in Afghanistan (sentence 2).\n2. Jake is assigned a peacekeeping mission in Ukraine, which he accepts despite personal reservations (sentence 6).\n3. Jake's squad encounters Brigadier General Lo, the warlord responsible for the unrest in Ukraine, leading to a tense confrontation (sentence 15).\n4. Jake discovers a secluded warehouse filled with illicit weaponry, hinting at a profound betrayal by his superiors, which leads to a significant downturn in his mission and personal relationships (sentence 23).\n5. Jake and Mira successfully expose General Lo's operation, leading to his downfall and the beginning of peace in Ukraine, culminating in Jake's promotion and Mira's leadership in the new government (sentences 37-40).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Jake is in a position of control and success, having just led a successful rescue mission. His state is high, with a sense of accomplishment and respect from his peers.\n- **Event 2**: Jake's state remains positive as he accepts a new challenge, despite some personal reservations. His commitment to duty keeps him in a high state, albeit with a hint of apprehension about the future.\n- **Event 3**: The confrontation with General Lo introduces tension and conflict, but Jake's determination and sense of duty keep him focused. His state is still positive, with a growing sense of the mission's challenges.\n- **Event 4**: The discovery of the betrayal by his superiors and the subsequent loss of trust from Mira and possibly his own team hits Jake hard. His state plummets as he faces not only external enemies but also internal doubts and conflicts. This is a significant low point.\n- **Event 5**: After taking matters into his own hands and succeeding in exposing General Lo, Jake's state improves dramatically. He achieves a higher state than at the beginning, having found both personal and professional success, including a promotion and a romantic relationship with Mira, contributing to the peace in Ukraine.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. Jake starts in a high state (successful rescue), faces challenges and tensions (peacekeeping mission, confrontation with General Lo), experiences a significant downturn (discovery of betrayal and loss of trust), and then recovers to an even higher state (exposing General Lo, finding peace and love). This pattern of falling into a dilemma (or hole) and then finding a way out, ending better than at the beginning, is characteristic of the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc. However, given the specific classification provided and the detailed analysis, it seems the narrative might align more closely with a \"Double Man in a Hole\" due to the two significant cycles of dilemma and recovery Jake undergoes: the first being the challenges of the mission and the second, the deeper personal and professional crisis following the discovery of the betrayal, which he overcomes to achieve an even higher state.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Sebastian Schlencht-W\u00f6hnert, a bank teller who becomes involved in a series of heists. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Sebastian's Recruitment**: Sebastian is recruited by Gwendoline Starr for an underground safecracking competition (Event 3).\n2. **The First Heist**: Sebastian and the crew successfully undertake their first heist in Paris (Event 8).\n3. **Betrayal and Pursuit**: Brad leaves Sebastian behind, forcing him to evade the police on his own (Event 15).\n4. **Reunion and Final Heist**: Sebastian reunites with Gwendoline and Korina, and they successfully hijack the last safe (Events 19-25).\n5. **Sacrifice and Escape**: Gwendoline sacrifices herself to be arrested, allowing Sebastian to escape (Events 30-31).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Recruitment)**: Sebastian's state changes from mundane to excited and challenged. He moves from a life of routine to one of adventure and possibility.\n- **Event 2 (The First Heist)**: Sebastian's state improves as he experiences success and the thrill of the heist. He gains confidence in his safecracking abilities and forms connections with the crew.\n- **Event 3 (Betrayal and Pursuit)**: Sebastian's state worsens as he faces danger and betrayal. He is left behind by his crew and must fend for himself, feeling isolated and vulnerable.\n- **Event 4 (Reunion and Final Heist)**: Sebastian's state improves again as he reunites with Gwendoline and Korina. He regains a sense of belonging and purpose, and his skills are once more recognized and valued.\n- **Event 5 (Sacrifice and Escape)**: Sebastian's state is bittersweet. While he escapes and achieves a form of success, he loses Gwendoline, indicating a personal cost to his adventures.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story follows a pattern where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (being left behind by the crew) and then finds a way out (reuniting with part of the crew and achieving their goal). However, the story also involves a rise to success (participating in and succeeding at the heists) followed by a drastic downfall (Gwendoline's sacrifice). This combination suggests that the story could fit into more than one story arc type, but the overall trajectory from a mundane life to a life of adventure, followed by personal loss, leans towards a specific arc.\n\nGiven the protagonist starts in a disadvantaged situation (mundane life), rises to success and adventure (through the heists), faces setbacks (betrayal and pursuit), recovers, and ultimately ends in a bittersweet state (having achieved success but at personal cost), the story arc that best fits is one where the protagonist faces challenges, overcomes them, but ends in a state that reflects both gain and loss.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and Major Events\nThe protagonist of the story is Sarah, a 25-year-old woman running from her turbulent history in Boston. Five major events in the story are:\n1. Sarah hurries to pack her belongings and leave, indicating she's fleeing her past ( Sentence 1).\n2. She notices a Buick tailing her, which introduces fear and tension into her journey (Sentence 2).\n3. The appearance of unsettling images and the voice of a woman in her mirror, reminiscent of her deceased mother, escalates her fear and introduces a supernatural element (Sentences 6 and 7).\n4. The realization that the ghostly presence is her mother and their decision to face the phantom and lead it to St. Mary's Chapel for exorcism marks a turning point where Sarah begins to confront her past (Sentences 12 and 13).\n5. The final event where Sarah speaks to her spectral mother, helping her find peace, and then embarks on a new mission with Tony to uncover secrets from their past, signifies a resolution and a new beginning for Sarah (Sentences 15, 19, and 22).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes\n- **Event 1**: Sarah is in a state of distress, fleeing her past. Her condition is low due to her turbulent history and the act of running away.\n- **Event 2**: The introduction of the Buick tailing her increases her fear and anxiety, worsening her condition.\n- **Event 3**: The supernatural occurrences further escalate her fear, making her condition even worse as she's now dealing with both her past and a terrifying, unexplainable situation.\n- **Event 4**: Deciding to confront the phantom is a turning point. Here, Sarah starts to take control of her situation, which is an improvement in her condition as she's no longer just fleeing or being acted upon.\n- **Event 5**: After helping her mother's spirit find peace, Sarah's condition improves significantly. She's no longer haunted by her past in the same way and has found a new purpose, which is to uncover the secrets of her past, indicating a move towards healing and resolution.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, it starts low (fleeing her past), worsens (introduction of fear and supernatural elements), and then improves as she confronts her past and finds a new purpose. This pattern follows the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc type, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (the haunting and fear) and then finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning (confronting her past, finding peace for her mother, and embarking on a new mission for self-discovery).\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Federal agent Aaron Falk. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Event 1: Return to Hometown** - Aaron Falk returns to his hometown of Kiewarra to attend the funeral of his childhood friend Luke Hadler.\n2. **Event 2: Investigation Begins** - Falk begins to investigate the circumstances surrounding Luke's death, with the help of Sergeant Greg Raco.\n3. **Event 3: Discovery of Key Evidence** - Falk discovers the word 'GRANT?' handwritten on the back of a library book receipt, leading him to suspect Grant and later to uncover the embezzlement by Scott Whitlam.\n4. **Event 4: Confrontation with Whitlam** - Falk and Raco confront Whitlam, who admits to the murder and then attempts to take his own life by setting himself on fire.\n5. **Event 5: Resolution and Closure** - The investigation is closed with Whitlam's confession, and Luke's parents thank Falk for proving Luke's innocence. Additionally, Falk finds evidence to clear his name regarding his girlfriend Ellie's death.\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1: Return to Hometown** - Aaron Falk is in a state of obligation and possibly guilt as he returns to his hometown for the funeral. His past in the town is complicated, and he is not welcomed back with open arms by everyone, particularly due to the suspicions surrounding Ellie's death.\n  \n- **Event 2: Investigation Begins** - Falk's state changes as he becomes more engaged and determined. He starts to uncover clues and work towards the truth, which begins to shift his focus from his past guilt to solving the current mystery. However, he still faces animosity from some townspeople.\n\n- **Event 3: Discovery of Key Evidence** - At this point, Falk is more hopeful and determined. The discovery of evidence starts to lead him towards the truth, improving his state as he feels he is making progress in clearing Luke's name and possibly his own.\n\n- **Event 4: Confrontation with Whitlam** - During the confrontation, Falk's state is one of danger and urgency. He and Raco are at risk as they deal with Whitlam's desperate attempt to escape justice. This event represents a significant challenge and a low point in terms of immediate danger.\n\n- **Event 5: Resolution and Closure** - Finally, Falk achieves closure and a form of redemption. He has solved the case, cleared Luke's name, and found evidence that could clear his own name regarding Ellie's death. His state at this point is one of resolution and possibly a newfound sense of peace and vindication.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the story. Aaron Falk starts in a somewhat disadvantaged position due to his past and the suspicion surrounding him. As he delves into the investigation, he faces challenges and dangers, but ultimately, he uncovers the truth, solves the case, and finds a form of personal redemption. This pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist faces significant challenges, falls into dilemmas (such as the danger with Whitlam and the ongoing suspicion against him), but ultimately finds a way out and ends in a better condition than when he started.\n\nGiven the pattern of facing challenges, being in a \"hole\" (facing dilemmas and dangers), and then recovering to end in a better state, the story arc resembles the **Double Man in a Hole** or simply **Man in a Hole** pattern, as the protagonist experiences a significant downturn (investigating a tragic crime, facing danger, and dealing with past traumas) but ultimately recovers and ends in a better state (having solved the case, cleared names, and found personal closure).\n\n### 4.

Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the analysis, Tomaz's story follows a pattern where he starts in a disadvantaged position (haunted by his past), improves as he finds new purpose and courage, but then faces a significant downfall as he becomes a host for the demon. This pattern resembles the **Oedipus** story arc, where the protagonist starts high, falls, recovers, and then faces another significant downfall. However, in Tomaz's case, it's more about starting low, rising, and then falling drastically. The key elements are the rise to a peak where Tomaz shows significant courage and determination, followed by a downfall that is worse than his initial state.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Robert Freeman, a renowned New York attorney. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Robert receives a mysterious call about his son Tyler** (sentence 5-7): This event sets off the chain of actions Robert takes to find his son.\n2. **Robert finds Tyler's sketchpad and realizes his son is missing** (sentence 9): This marks the beginning of Robert's desperate search for Tyler.\n3. **Robert discovers a cryptic note from Tyler leading to a dilapidated tenement** (sentence 17-18): This event introduces a clue that guides Robert's search and involves him deeper in the mystery.\n4. **Robert, along with Mia and the old man, confronts the kidnappers and rescues Tyler** (sentence 34-38): This is the climax of the story where Robert's actions lead to the rescue of his son.\n5. **Robert decides to leave his legal profession to focus on his relationship with Tyler** (sentence 42-45): This event signifies a change in Robert's life priorities and marks the beginning of his healing and rebuilding process with his son.\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1 (Mysterious Call)**: Robert's state changes from being a successful, albeit distant, father and attorney to someone faced with a mysterious and potentially dangerous situation regarding his son. His condition worsens as he feels a \"chill of dread.\"\n- **Event 2 (Finding Sketchpad)**: Robert's state deteriorates further as he realizes his son is missing. The harsh reality of his situation sets in, and his feelings of guilt and desperation intensify.\n- **Event 3 (Discovering Cryptic Note)**: Robert's state begins to shift slightly as he finds a lead in the search for his son. Although still desperate and worried, he now has a direction and hope, which slightly improves his condition.\n- **Event 4 (Confronting Kidnappers)**: Robert's state improves significantly as he rescues his son. The relief and joy of being reunited with Tyler mark a turning point where Robert's condition begins to improve substantially.\n- **Event 5 (Leaving Legal Profession)**: Robert's state continues to improve as he decides to prioritize his relationship with his son. This decision reflects a personal growth and a commitment to change, indicating that Robert's condition has improved from where it started, both in terms of his personal life and his relationship with Tyler.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the description of Robert's state throughout the major events, the story arc can be classified as a \"Man in a Hole.\" This classification is chosen because Robert starts in a relatively good position as a successful attorney but falls into a dilemma (his son's disappearance) that worsens his condition (feelings of guilt, desperation, and fear). However, through his actions and decisions, Robert finds a way out of this dilemma (rescuing his son and deciding to change his life priorities), ending in a better state than where he began. The key characteristic of the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc is the protagonist's fall into a difficult situation followed by a rise to a better condition than before, which aligns with Robert's journey from a successful but distant father to a more involved and caring one after facing and overcoming the challenge of his son's disappearance.\n\n### 4.

Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1 (Receiving the news)**: John is in a state of disbelief and confusion, struggling to accept the news about Peter. His state is one of emotional turmoil.\n- **Event 2 (Deciding to investigate)**: John's state changes to one of determination and resolve.

        "output": "### 1. Identification of Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist in the story is Victoria Johnson, an accomplished financial analyst. Five major events in the story can be identified as follows:\n\n1. **Introduction to Victoria's Professional Life**: Victoria is introduced as a skilled financial analyst who is persistently sidelined despite her abilities (sentences 3-4).\n2. **The Arrival of Rebecca Mitchell and Subsequent Disappointment**: Rebecca arrives, and despite her lack of skills, she is chosen over Victoria for a promotion, further sidelining Victoria (sentences 5-8).\n3. **Victoria's Decision to Leave and Start Her Own Firm**: Faced with constant underestimation and bias towards physical appearance over competence, Victoria decides to quit her job and start her own financial consultancy firm (sentence 13).\n4. **Victoria's Success and Rebecca's Downfall**: Victoria's startup gains traction and succeeds, while Rebecca's ineptitude leads to the decline of \"Gleason & Grae\" (sentences 15-20).\n5. **Victoria's Triumph and Acceptance as CEO**: Victoria is offered the role of CEO at \"Gleason & Grae\" after successfully turning the firm around, marking a significant professional triumph (sentences 22-23).\n\n### 2. Description of Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Victoria is in a state of professional dissatisfaction, feeling underappreciated and overlooked despite her skills.\n- **Event 2**: Victoria's state worsens as she experiences professional disillusionment with the promotion of Rebecca, feeling her skills are not valued.\n- **Event 3**: Victoria's decision to leave marks a turning point where she begins to take control of her career, moving from a state of disappointment to one of determination and risk-taking.\n- **Event 4**: Victoria's state improves significantly as her startup succeeds, and she proves her competence, contrasting with Rebecca's failure.\n- **Event 5**: Victoria reaches a peak state of professional success and recognition, being accepted as the CEO of \"Gleason & Grae\" and becoming a symbol of hope for women in the corporate world.\n\n### 3. Classification of Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. Initially, Victoria is in a disadvantaged position, feeling undervalued and overlooked. She then faces a setback with Rebecca's promotion, which worsens her state. However, she takes a significant risk by quitting her job and starting her own firm, marking the beginning of her ascent. As her startup succeeds and she eventually becomes the CEO of \"Gleason & Grae\", Victoria's condition improves dramatically from her initial state.\n\nThis pattern follows the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (feeling undervalued and then facing professional disillusionment) but finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning (achieving great success and recognition). The key element here is that Victoria's condition improves from the point of her greatest challenge to the end of the story, fitting the \"Man in a Hole\" narrative.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\nThe protagonists in this story are Ben, Charlie, Arnold, and Earl, a group of friends who share a love for books. However, for the sake of analysis, we can consider the group as a collective protagonist since their experiences and conditions change together throughout the story. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. The decision to meet in person after pandemic restrictions lift (sentence 6).\n2. The confusion and misadventures in trying to decide on a meeting spot (sentences 7-13).\n3. Participating in a local costume competition and finding an unpublished manuscript attributed to J.D. Salinger (sentences 16-21).\n4. The chaos and debate over the manuscript's credibility, followed by the encounter with the actual treasure seekers (sentences 22-25).\n5. Returning the manuscript and reflecting on their adventure at Arnold's estate (sentences 29-32).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n- **Event 1:** The group decides to meet in person, indicating a positive state of anticipation and excitement for returning to normal social interactions. Their condition is one of looking forward to improving their social connections.\n- **Event 2:** The confusion over the meeting spot leads to individual misadventures, placing each character in a state of confusion and slight frustration. Their collective condition worsens due to the misunderstandings, but the tone remains light and comedic.\n- **Event 3:** Finding the unpublished manuscript elevates their state to one of excitement and curiosity. This event improves their condition from the previous state of confusion, as they are now engaged in a thrilling and unexpected adventure.\n- **Event 4:** The debate over the manuscript's credibility and the subsequent chaos introduce a state of tension and comedic absurdity. While their condition might seem to worsen due to the conflict, the overall tone of the story keeps the situation humorous and engaging. This event can be seen as a temporary downturn before they resolve the situation.\n- **Event 5:** Reflecting on their adventure at Arnold's estate, the group's state is one of contentment and strengthened friendship. They have overcome their misadventures and are now in a better condition than at the start, having shared a unique and bonding experience.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\nThe story arc type can be classified based on how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the story. Given the events outlined:\n- The group starts in a positive state, looking forward to meeting in person.\n- They then face a series of misadventures and confusions, which can be considered a downturn.\n- However, they quickly recover and experience an uplift with the exciting discovery of the manuscript.\n- A temporary conflict arises over the manuscript, but it is resolved in a comedic and positive manner.\n- Finally, they end in a better state than they began, with strengthened friendships and memorable experiences.\n\nThis pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonists face challenges, recover, and ultimately end in a better state than they started. The presence of two significant cycles of dilemma (the meeting spot confusion and the manuscript debacle) and recovery (finding the manuscript and resolving the conflict) indicates a specific story arc type.\n\n### 4.

Description of Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **Introduction to Amelia's Work**: At the beginning, Amelia is in a state of professional dedication and personal stability, deeply engaged in her work.\n2. **The Highway Accident**: This event marks a turning point where Amelia's personal and professional life starts to intersect, showing her compassionate side but also beginning to affect her work rhythm.\n3. **Discovery of the Crime Pattern**: Amelia becomes obsessed with uncovering the truth behind the accidents, which starts to strain her personal life, particularly her marriage, but professionally, she is driven and determined.\n4. **Confrontation with the Crime Syndicate**: Amelia's situation worsens as she faces threats and her marriage suffers significantly. Professionally, she is suspended but personally resolved to see justice served.\n5. **Resolution and Aftermath**: Amelia emerges victorious in her pursuit of justice, having dismantled the crime syndicate, but at a personal cost, including the loss of Jack and a strained relationship with her husband.

However, she then falls into a series of dilemmas, including the strain on her marriage, threats to her life, and professional suspension.

This pattern of falling into a hole (facing dilemmas) and then finding a way out (resolving the case) is characteristic of the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc. Amelia's condition improves from the lowest point (facing threats and personal losses) to the end, where she emerges stronger and more determined, having overcome her challenges.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Dr. Rose Cotter, a therapist who meets a patient named Laura Weaver at a psychiatric ward. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. Laura's death and Rose's initial exposure to the supernatural entity (sentences 1-4).\n2. Rose's realization that she is experiencing hallucinations and her concern for her own mental well-being (sentences 7-8).\n3. Rose's investigation into the entity and the discovery of a pattern of suicides (sentences 14-16).\n4. Rose's visit to Robert Talley, where she learns about the entity's true nature and how it feeds on trauma (sentence 21).\n5. Rose's final confrontation with the entity, leading to her possession and subsequent death (sentences 32-35).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **Initial Exposure (sentences 1-4):** Rose is a professional, composed therapist. After Laura's death, Rose is terrified, indicating a significant drop in her emotional and psychological state.\n\n2. **Realization of Hallucinations (sentences 7-8):** Rose's condition worsens as she begins to experience hallucinations, leading to concerns about her mental health. This event marks a further decline in her state compared to the initial event.\n\n3. **Investigation (sentences 14-16):** Rose is determined and proactive, trying to understand the entity. However, this determination is rooted in her growing desperation and fear, indicating that while she is taking action, her overall psychological state remains precarious and possibly worsening.\n\n4. **Visit to Robert Talley (sentence 21):** Rose learns the horrific truth about the entity and is faced with an impossible moral choice. This knowledge likely exacerbates her fear and desperation, further deteriorating her condition.\n\n5. **Final Confrontation (sentences 32-35):** Rose's state reaches its lowest point as she is possessed by the entity and dies, passing the curse on. This event signifies a complete downfall, both physically and psychologically.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the description of Rose's state throughout the major events, it's clear that her condition consistently worsens from the beginning to the end of the story. She starts as a composed professional and ends in a state of complete psychological and physical downfall. This pattern aligns with the **Riches to Rags** story arc type, where the protagonist begins in a high-status position (in this case, emotionally and professionally stable) and ends in a significantly lower state (completely consumed by the entity and dead).\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Kath. Five major events in the story are:\n1. Kath and Max arrive at the woodland cabin to find it already occupied by Al and Greta (sentences 1-3).\n2. Kath discovers Max and Greta having an affair, leading to her abandonment by Max (sentences 7-9).\n3. Kath decides to track down Greta and understand what happened, leading her to meet Nicholas Barlow (sentences 11-14).\n4. Kath discovers the truth about Nicholas' intentions and the reason behind Max's disappearance (sentences 24-30).\n5. Kath confronts Nicholas, Al, and Greta, and in the ensuing events, Max dies, and she imprisons the others (sentences 31-33).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: Kath's state is one of anticipation and relaxation, looking forward to a weekend getaway with her boyfriend. Her condition is relatively high, expecting a pleasant time.\n- **Event 2**: Kath's state significantly worsens as she discovers Max's infidelity, leading to emotional distress and abandonment. Her condition drops to a low point.\n- **Event 3**: Kath's determination to find Greta and understand the situation shows a recovery in her state. She is proactive and seeking closure, indicating an improvement in her condition.\n- **Event 4**: Upon discovering the sinister plot involving Nicholas, Al, and Greta, Kath's state becomes one of shock, anger, and possibly fear. This is another downturn in her condition as she faces a dangerous and complex situation.\n- **Event 5**: The final confrontation ends with Max's death and Kath imprisoning the antagonists. While she has taken action and gained a form of revenge or justice, the loss of Max and the overall experience likely leave her in a somber, reflective state, not necessarily better off than at the beginning but having undergone significant personal growth and change.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. Kath starts in a relatively good state, faces a significant downfall (Max's betrayal), recovers somewhat by taking action, faces another severe challenge (the truth about Nicholas and the danger to Max), and ultimately ends in a complex state of having resolved the situation but at great personal cost (Max's death and the trauma experienced).\n\nThis pattern aligns with the **Oedipus** story arc, where the protagonist starts high, falls, recovers, and then faces another significant downfall. Kath's journey from a hopeful weekend getaway to the depths of betrayal, through a process of seeking truth and justice, and ending in a state of tragic resolution, fits this arc. The Oedipus arc is characterized by a protagonist who experiences a rise, a fall, a recovery, and then a final, often tragic, downfall. Kath's story, with its themes of betrayal, pursuit of truth, and ultimate tragedy, embodies this pattern.\n\n### 4. Determined Story Arc Type\n\nOedipus"

Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: At the beginning, Ava is in control, operating as a skilled assassin. Her condition is one of power and independence.\n- **Event 2**: When Ava visits her family, her state shifts to one of vulnerability and personal connection, showing a softer side beyond her professional persona.\n- **Event 3**: After the botched operation in Saudi Arabia, Ava's state becomes one of caution and self-preservation, highlighting the risks and unpredictability of her profession.\n- **Event 4**: Upon learning of Duke's betrayal and murder, Ava's state deteriorates to one of grief, anger, and a sense of betrayal, marking a significant low point in her emotional and professional life.\n- **Event 5**: Finally, when Ava confronts and kills Simon, her state is one of determination and empowerment, as she takes control of her situation and seeks justice for Duke's death.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story does not follow a straightforward **Rags to Riches** or **Cinderella** arc, as Ava's condition does not consistently improve from the start to the end. It also does not fit the **Riches to Rags** pattern, as Ava starts in a complex state of being a skilled but troubled assassin and ends in a state of having overcome significant challenges, albeit still being stalked. The **Icarus** pattern does not apply because Ava does not rise to a peak of success before falling; instead, she navigates a series of challenges without a clear ascent. The **Oedipus** pattern is also not a good fit because Ava does not start in a high state and then fall twice. The **Double Man in a Hole** could be considered, given Ava's multiple dilemmas and recoveries, but the most fitting seems to be **Man in a Hole**, as Ava faces numerous challenges (being targeted, Duke's betrayal, personal relationship issues) and finds a way out, ending in a state of having resolved some of her issues but still facing threats.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To analyze the story arc, let's first identify the protagonist and major events in the story.\n\n1. **Protagonist Identification and Major Events:**\n   - The story has multiple characters, but if we focus on the ones who drive the plot forward and undergo significant changes, we can identify Brian Harper and Jo (Jocinda \"Jo\" Fowler) as central protagonists. However, for the sake of analysis, let's consider Brian Harper as the primary protagonist since his transformation and actions are pivotal to the story's progression.\n   - Five major events in the story are:\n     1. The alien swarm attack on the Space Shuttle mission (sentence 2).\n     2. Brian's return to Earth and being fired from NASA (sentence 3).\n     3. The discovery of the Moon's anomalous orbit and the global panic (sentences 5-8).\n     4. The revelation about the Moon being a Dyson sphere and the true nature of the alien swarm (sentence 17).\n     5. The final mission to correct the Moon's orbit and destroy the swarm, resulting in the Moon's power being restored (sentences 23-24).\n\n2. **Protagonist's State at Each Event:**\n   - **Event 1 (Alien Swarm Attack):** Brian's state changes from being a respected astronaut on a mission to being the sole witness of a catastrophic event, which sets him on a path of disbelief and isolation.\n   - **Event 2 (Fired from NASA):** Brian's condition worsens; he goes from being a trusted professional to being discredited and unemployed, hitting a low point in his career and personal life.\n   - **Event 3 (Discovery of the Moon's Anomalous Orbit):** Brian's state starts to improve slightly as he gets involved again with the mystery of the alien swarm, but he's still in a state of limbo, not fully redeemed or back in his professional element.\n   - **Event 4 (Revelation about the Moon):** This event marks a significant turning point for Brian as he learns the truth about the Moon and his past experiences. His condition improves as he gains a deeper understanding and purpose, moving towards redemption.\n   - **Event 5 (Final Mission):** Brian's condition improves further as he plays a crucial role in saving the Earth, redeeming himself professionally and personally, and finding closure.\n\n3. **Story Arc Classification:**\n   - The story follows a pattern where the protagonist (Brian) faces a significant downfall (being attacked and then fired), then undergoes a period of recovery and growth as he uncovers the truth and redeemed himself through his actions in the final mission.\n   - This pattern resembles the **Double Man in a Hole** story arc, where the protagonist faces two cycles of dilemma and recovery. However, upon closer inspection, it's more aligned with the **Man in a Hole** story arc, as Brian falls into a dilemma (the attack and its aftermath) and then finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning. The elements of recovery, revelation, and ultimate redemption fit this arc type.\n\n4. **Determined Story Arc Type:**\n   Man in a Hole"

        "output": "To classify the story arc type, we first need to identify the protagonist in the story. The protagonist can be considered as Konga, the monkey who undergoes significant transformations and experiences throughout the narrative.\n\n1. **Identify 5 major events in the story:**\n   - Event 1: The monkey is experimented on with KTNT (sentence 11).\n   - Event 2: The monkey is set free by Professor Mills as the facility is attacked (sentence 13).\n   - Event 3: Konga grows to enormous size after being discovered by the boys (sentence 20).\n   - Event 4: Konga causes mass destruction in the city and abducts a woman (sentences 24 and 22).\n   - Event 5: Konga returns to his original size, and the boys embrace him (sentence 27).\n\n2. **Describe the protagonist's state and how it changed relative to the previous events:**\n   - At Event 1, Konga is in a vulnerable state, being experimented on. This is a low point for him.\n   - By Event 2, Konga's state improves as he is set free, escaping potential harm from the terrorists and the experimentation.\n   - At Event 3, Konga's physical state changes dramatically as he grows to enormous size, but this can be seen as both a rise in power and a fall into chaos and danger.\n   - During Event 4, Konga's actions lead to destruction and fear, indicating a low point in terms of his control over his situation and his relations with humans.\n   - At Event 5, Konga returns to his normal size, and the boys' acceptance of him can be seen as a recovery or an improvement in his condition, as he finds acceptance and safety.\n\n3. **Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain your reasoning:**\n   The story follows Konga as he faces various challenges and transformations. Initially, he is in a disadvantaged situation (being experimented on), then he experiences a series of ups and downs (being freed, growing in size, causing destruction, and finally returning to normal and finding acceptance). This pattern suggests that Konga falls into a dilemma (the experimentation and later the uncontrolled growth) and finds a way out, ending in a better state than where he began (finding acceptance with the boys). This aligns with the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist's condition improves from the first turning point (being experimented on) to the last turning point (finding acceptance), despite facing setbacks along the way.\n\n4. **Determined story arc type:**\nMan in a Hole"

Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Willa (Wilhelmina \"Willa\" Davis). Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Willa and Bill Run Into Each Other**: At an unnamed regional airport on Leap Day, ex-lovers Willa and Bill run into each other and make small talk during their layovers.\n2. **The Storm Causes Flight Delays**: A storm causes flights at the airport to be delayed, leaving Willa and Bill to reconnect.\n3. **Willa Reveals Her Past**: While Willa and Bill reminisce about their past relationship, it is revealed that Willa suffered a miscarriage while she was with Bill, and she later gave her daughter up for adoption.\n4. **Willa Decides to Meet Her Daughter**: Willa tells Bill that she is actually going to Boston to meet her daughter, Maggie, who just turned 20 and wants to meet her.\n5. **Willa and Bill Part Ways**: After a series of emotional moments and connections, Willa and Bill exchange a kiss and then leave to board their flights, with a sense of hope and new beginnings.\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Initially, Willa seems to be in a neutral state, simply going about her travel plans. Her encounter with Bill brings up past emotions but doesn't immediately indicate a significant change in her state.\n- **Event 2**: The storm and subsequent flight delays put Willa in a situation where she must confront her past through her interactions with Bill. This could be seen as a dip in her emotional state as she deals with nostalgia and possibly unresolved feelings.\n- **Event 3**: Revealing her past to Bill, including the miscarriage and giving up her daughter for adoption, shows that Willa is in a vulnerable state. However, sharing this information might also be a step towards healing or closure.\n- **Event 4**: Learning that her daughter wants to meet her and deciding to go through with the meeting significantly improves Willa's state. This event brings hope and the possibility of resolving past regrets or unfinished business.\n- **Event 5**: Parting ways with Bill after rekindling their connection and with the prospect of meeting her daughter, Willa's state improves further. She seems to be on a path towards healing, new connections, and possibly a brighter future.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the analysis, Willa's condition starts at a neutral point, dips as she confronts her past and emotional vulnerabilities, and then improves as she moves towards healing, reconnecting with her past (both through Bill and the prospect of meeting her daughter), and embracing new beginnings. This pattern follows a narrative where the protagonist faces a dilemma (or is in a \"hole\") and then finds a way out, ending in a better state than where they started.\n\n### 4.

Description of Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Car Breaks Down)**: Christopher is in a state of shock and vulnerability. His reliable car, which is likely his means of safety and mobility, has failed him, leaving him stranded in an ominous location.\n- **Event 2 (Meets John and Enters 'The Fun Factory')**: Christopher's state changes to one of cautious curiosity. He is exhausted and seeking help, but the eerie environment of 'The Fun Factory' introduces a sense of unease and foreboding.\n- **Event 3 (Discovers Dark Past and Animatronics)**: Christopher's state deteriorates to fear and apprehension. The discovery of the dark past and the animatronic dolls increases his sense of danger and unease.\n- **Event 4 (Animatronics Come to Life)**: Christopher's state becomes one of extreme fear and desperation. The animatronics' malicious behavior puts him in immediate danger, forcing him to fight for survival.\n- **Event 5 (Escape and Burning of 'The Fun Factory')**: Christopher's state improves to one of relief and empowerment. He has managed to outsmart his enemies, escape the dangerous situation, and even take revenge by burning down 'The Fun Factory'.\n\n### 3.

This pattern matches the **Man in a Hole** story arc, where the protagonist's condition improves from the first turning point (the car breaking down) to the last turning point (escaping and burning down 'The Fun Factory').

Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n- **Event 1:** Alexander is in a state of frustration and boredom with his routine work life but becomes intrigued and motivated upon discovering the financial irregularity. His state changes from stagnant to engaged.\n- **Event 2:** Alexander transitions from being an individual with an idea to a leader of a group, the 'Legion of Cashiers'. His state changes from solo contemplation to collaborative action, indicating an increase in excitement and risk.\n- **Event 3:** With the successful execution of their scheme, Alexander feels a sense of accomplishment and possibly elation.

His state changes from success to crisis, indicating a significant downturn in his emotional state.\n- **Event 5:** Alexander and the team decide to disband and return to their normal lives, but not before pulling off one last successful operation. Alexander's state changes from crisis to resolution and newfound contentment, as he reflects on the experiences and the personal growth, including a budding romance.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\nThe story arc can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout. Initially, Alexander is in a disadvantageous situation (bored and overlooked), which can be considered a \"low\" point. He then discovers an opportunity, forms a plan, and executes it successfully, reaching a \"high\" point. However, this success is followed by a crisis (the auditor's investigation and the team's internal conflicts), which represents a \"low\" point. Finally, Alexander and the team navigate this crisis, achieve one last success, and disband, returning to their normal lives but with personal growth and contentment, which can be seen as ending on a \"high\" note compared to where he started.\n\nGiven this pattern, the story fits the **Man in a Hole** arc because Alexander falls into a dilemma (the crisis with the auditor) but finds a way out, ending better than he was at the beginning (with personal growth, a romance, and a sense of fulfillment).\n\n### 4.

Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc can be classified by analyzing the trajectory of the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. Initially, John is in a disadvantaged situation (financial hardship). He then faces a moral dilemma and chooses the higher ground, but this leads to a temporary setback (feeling betrayed by Gwen and his isolation). However, the story takes a turn for the better as Gwen forgives him and helps him financially, leading to a significant improvement in John's condition (financial stability and finding love).\n\nThis pattern follows a specific story arc type where the protagonist rises, faces a setback, and ultimately achieves a higher state than where they started. The initial rise is John's discovery of the Ferrari and his decision not to steal it, showing moral growth. The setback is the temporary isolation and feeling of betrayal. The ultimate achievement of a higher state is John receiving the financial help and finding love with Gwen, ending in a better condition than at the beginning of the story.\n\n### 4.

trust him at all now, she too then wishes him a merry Christmas.\n57) On the way home, Joyce angrily pulls over and, in dialogue similar to his nightmare earlier, reveals that she knows there is something bigger going on.\n58) That night, after an emotional breakdown, Joyce begs Sam to tell her if he has been having an affair and he tells her he has.\n59) As they argue in the living room,

and Rebecca, traumatized by the incident, stare at Sam as Savannah pulls them away and Sam lowers his head in shame, knowing that he can no longer control the narrative and image of who he is to these women.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better (e.g., 0\u21921\u21922\u21924\u219210)\n- Riches to Rags: Protagonist starts high and ends lower (e.g.,

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Sam Hodges, the father and husband in the Hodges family. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **The Break-in and Vandalism**: The story begins with a break-in at the Hodges' home, where a masked individual is seen, and later, vandalism occurs, including a dead deer found in Rebecca's car trunk.\n2. **The Revelation of Sam's Affair**: It is revealed that Sam is having an affair with Julia, a paralegal at his law firm, which adds a layer of complexity to his character and the family's situation.\n3. **The Murder of Layne**: Sam kills Layne, believing him to be the stalker, only to later discover that he was incorrect, and the real stalker had been watching him the entire time.\n4. **The Confrontation at the Church**: Sam's panic and paranoia reach a peak at the church during a faith healing ceremony, where he mistakenly accuses a child of being the stalker due to a cast on the child's hand, not realizing the actual stalker has missing fingers.\n5. **The Final Confrontation and Revelation**: The story culminates in a dramatic confrontation where Sam is forced to reveal his dark past, including the rape of a girl named Molly in college, leading to a tragic outcome for all involved.\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **At the first event (The Break-in and Vandalism)**: Sam is concerned for his family's safety but also suspicious of his daughter's boyfriend, Layne. His state is one of caution and mistrust.\n- **At the second event (The Revelation of Sam's Affair)**: Sam's personal life is complicated by his affair, showing a lack of integrity and honesty, especially towards his wife. His state becomes more complex, with guilt and secrecy added to his concerns.\n- **At the third event (The Murder of Layne)**: Sam's actions lead to a tragic mistake, killing an innocent person. His state deteriorates to one of horror, guilt, and desperation.\n- **At the fourth event (The Confrontation at the Church)**: Sam's paranoia and guilt reach a boiling point, leading to a public outburst. His state is one of complete desperation and loss of control.\n- **At the fifth event (The Final Confrontation and Revelation)**: Sam is forced to confront his darkest secret and the consequences of his actions. His state ends in shame, loss, and a complete downfall from his initial position of a respected family man.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, it's clear that Sam starts in a relatively high position as a respected attorney and family man but gradually falls into a deeper and deeper hole due to his own actions and secrets. The story arc follows a pattern where the protagonist's condition worsens significantly from the beginning to the end, with moments of attempted recovery or hiding of his true state, but ultimately leading to a drastic downfall.\n\nThe story fits the **Oedipus** story arc type because Sam starts in a high position, falls due to his flaws (the affair, mistrust, and eventually the revelation of his past crime), attempts to recover or hide his situation, but ultimately faces another significant downfall when his darkest secret is revealed, leading to his complete loss of status, respect, and family trust.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identify the protagonist and 5 major events in the story\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Tom Harris, a freelance undercover operative working for the CIA.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. **The successful mission**: Tom successfully inserts malware into the Iranian nuclear research facility, causing it to self-destruct (sentence 3).\n2. **The identity compromise**: Tom's and his partner Oliver's identities are compromised, leading to Oliver's murder and forcing Tom to leave Iran (sentence 8).\n3. **The leak in Afghanistan**: In Herat, Afghanistan, Tom's cover is blown due to an intelligence leak, and the mission is aborted (sentence 14).\n4. **The capture**: Tom and his translator Mo are captured by a Taliban warlord paid by Kahil (sentence 25).\n5. **The final escape**: Tom, with the help of Roman and later a CIA-ordered missile strike, manages to escape his captors and reunite with his family (sentences 30-38).\n\n### 2. Describe the protagonist's state and how it changed at each event\n\n- **Event 1 (The successful mission)**: Tom's state is one of success and fulfillment of his mission objectives. His condition is high as he has achieved what he set out to do without immediate repercussions.\n- **Event 2 (The identity compromise)**: Tom's state changes to one of danger and urgency. His cover is blown, and he is at risk, indicating a significant downturn in his condition.\n- **Event 3 (The leak in Afghanistan)**: Tom's state worsens further as his cover is blown again, and he is in even greater danger, both from the Iranians and now from other forces in Afghanistan. This marks another low point in his condition.\n- **Event 4 (The capture)**: Tom's state reaches one of its lowest points as he is captured by enemies, indicating a complete loss of control over his situation.\n- **Event 5 (The final escape)**: Tom's state improves dramatically as he manages to escape his captors, thanks to Roman's sacrifice and the CIA's intervention. He reunites with his family, marking a high point in his condition.\n\n### 3. Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain the reasoning\n\nThe story arc can be classified by analyzing the fluctuations in Tom's condition throughout the narrative. Initially, Tom experiences success (high point), followed by a series of challenges and setbacks (low points) including the compromise of his identity, the failure of his mission in Afghanistan, and his capture. However, the story concludes with Tom escaping and reuniting with his family (high point), after facing and overcoming significant obstacles.\n\nThis pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist faces multiple dilemmas but ultimately recovers and ends in a better or at least a safe state. The **Double Man in a Hole** story arc fits this description because it involves the protagonist facing two cycles of dilemma and recovery. Tom first falls into a hole (identity compromise and mission failure) and then recovers somewhat (escape from Iran), only to fall into another, deeper hole (capture) and finally recover again (final escape and reunion with his family).\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Dr. Jaxon Carter, a renowned astrophysicist. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. Dr. Carter's research on cosmic energy patterns and the initial reports of a global increase in suicide rates (sentences 1-5).\n2. The visit from FBI Agent Daniels, informing Dr. Carter that the U.S. government is taking the prophets' predictions of a cosmic cataclysm seriously (sentences 10-12).\n3. Dr. Carter's discovery of the connection between the cosmic energies and human neurotransmitters, and the revelation that enigmatic creatures are influencing human minds (sentences 15-18).\n4. The failure of Dr. Carter's initial attempts to devise a countermeasure against the cosmic influence, coupled with the personal loss of his colleague, Dr. Erin Thompson (sentences 20-23).\n5. The ultimate success of Dr. Carter and his team in creating a device that can counteract the negative cosmic energy, and the subsequent global shift towards positivity and unity (sentences 30-56).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: Dr. Carter is depicted as a focused, accomplished astrophysicist, but the global situation is deteriorating, which introduces an element of concern into his otherwise successful and isolated academic life.\n- **Event 2**: The visit from Agent Daniels introduces a significant element of urgency and danger into Dr. Carter's life, shifting his state from one of academic focus to one of heightened awareness and responsibility.\n- **Event 3**: With the discovery of the inter-dimensional influence on human minds, Dr. Carter's state becomes one of alarm and determination. He is driven to understand and combat this phenomenon.\n- **Event 4**: The failure to find an immediate solution and the personal loss of Dr. Thompson plunge Dr. Carter into a state of grief and intensified resolve. His situation has become more dire, both personally and professionally.\n- **Event 5**: The success of the device and the global turn towards positivity mark a significant improvement in Dr. Carter's state. He transitions from a position of desperation and loss to one of hope and triumph, not just for himself, but for humanity.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc of Dr. Jaxon Carter follows a pattern where he begins in a state of success and isolation, falls into a deepening crisis as the global situation deteriorates and he faces personal losses, and then emerges in a state of triumph and global influence. This pattern aligns with the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma and then finds a way out, ending in a better state than at the beginning. Dr. Carter's journey from a revered but reclusive astrophysicist to a global symbol of hope and resilience, after navigating through the challenges posed by the cosmic energy and its influence on humanity, exemplifies this arc.\n\n### 4.

even the sassy Ash and the eccentric Hazel had their comedic arguments over their counseling methodologies, wrapping up this vibrant tale with laughter echoing off the forest walls.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better (e.g., 0\u21921\u21922\u21924\u219210)\n- Riches to Rags: Protagonist starts high and ends lower (e.g., 10\u21929\u21928\u21926\u21920)\n- Man in a Hole: Protagonist falls into trouble but recovers (e.g., 6\u21922\u21921\u21924\u219210)\n- Icarus: Protagonist rises then falls dramatically (e.g., 2\u21924\u21929\u21925\u21921)\n- Double Man in a Hole: Two cycles of fall and recovery (e.g., 6\u21922\u21927\u21924\u219210)\n- Cinderella: Rise, setback, ultimate triumph (e.g., 1\u21927\u21924\u21921\u219210)\n- Oedipus: Start high, fall, recover, final fall (e.g., 10\u21924\u21927\u21929\u21921)",
        "output": "To classify the story arc type, let's first identify the protagonist and major events in the story.\n\nThe protagonist of the story can be considered as the community as a whole, with Ash and Hazel being the central figures who influence the events and help others. However, since the story focuses on the interactions and relationships among various couples (Ash and Hazel, Martyn and Orion, Arthur and Guinevere, Fergus and Melody), it's more accurate to analyze the story through the lens of these relationships rather than a single protagonist. For simplicity, we'll consider Ash and Hazel as the protagonists since they are the ones who provide guidance and support to the others.\n\nHere are 5 major events in the story:\n\n1. **Introduction to the Community and Their Dynamics**: The story introduces the reader to a lively community in Sherwood forest, highlighting their unique personalities and relationships (sentences 1-6).\n2. **Challenges and Conflicts Arise**: Various couples face challenges, such as Martyn and Orion's disagreement over their wedding preferences, Arthur's struggle to keep up with Guinevere, and Fergus and Melony's issues with magic and their public displays of affection (sentences 11-15).\n3. **Intervention and Attempted Solutions**: Ash and Hazel intervene with advice, such as suggesting the use of an Aphrodite Elixir for Arthur, which leads to more chaos and humorous situations (sentences 18-22).\n4. **Resolutions and Compromises**: The couples start to find resolutions to their problems, such as Martyn and Orion compromising on their wedding plans, Arthur admitting his limitations and Guinevere agreeing to accommodate him, and Fergus and Melony trying to control their public displays of affection (sentences 23-27).\n5. **Conclusion and Celebration**: The community comes together for the weddings, and despite the comedic mishaps, they celebrate their love and friendships, with Ash and Hazel being appreciated for their help (sentences 29-34).\n\nNow, let's analyze the protagonist's (Ash and Hazel's) state and how it changes relative to the previous events:\n\n- At the **first event**, Ash and Hazel are introduced as the leaders of the community, known for their humor and unique relationship. Their state is positive and influential.\n- Moving to the **second event**, as challenges arise among the couples, Ash and Hazel's state doesn't directly change, but their role becomes more crucial as they are needed to help resolve the issues.\n- By the **third event**, Ash and Hazel's advice, although well-intentioned, leads to more chaos. This could be seen as a temporary downfall in their influence or effectiveness, but it's more of a comedic twist rather than a serious decline.\n- At the **fourth event**, as resolutions are found, Ash and Hazel's state improves again as their community starts to find happiness and solutions to their problems.\n- Finally, at the **fifth event**, Ash and Hazel are celebrated for their contributions, ending on a high note.\n\nGiven this analysis, the story arc type can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout. The community, with Ash and Hazel at the center, faces challenges and comedic mishaps but ultimately ends in a better state than where they started, with their relationships and community bonds strengthened.\n\nThe determined story arc type is Man in a Hole."

Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **At John's Return**: John is confident but clearly carries the weight of his past. His state is one of cautious optimism, returning to a place that holds both happy memories and unresolved pain.\n- **Confronting the Past**: John's state deteriorates as he confronts the traumatic event that led to his departure. This event brings to the surface the pain and guilt he has been carrying, showing a vulnerable side.\n- **Confession and Redemption**: John's state begins to improve as he confesses his past mistakes and seeks redemption. This act of confession seems to lighten his emotional burden, and he begins to see a path towards making amends.\n- **Facing Adversity**: John's state becomes one of determination and resolve as he prepares to face the Devilsnake Gang. Despite the danger, he is no longer alone, having his brother's support, which strengthens his resolve.\n- **Final Confrontation**: John's state is one of courage and determination.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story can be considered as Dr. Jane Reynolds, given her central role in the narrative, especially in the scientific exploration and the ultimate plan to stop the alien entity.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. **The Discovery**: Dr. Reynolds and her team discover the alien spacecraft and the entity known as \"the Voyager\" (sentences 11-14).\n2. **The Explosion**: The Voyager suddenly explodes, killing most of the team and leaving Dr. Reynolds and Thompson barely alive (sentence 17).\n3. **The Pursuit**: Dr. Reynolds and Thompson learn that the Voyager has survived and is moving towards Phoenix, prompting them to devise a plan to stop it (sentences 20-22).\n4. **The Battle**: Thompson and his team engage the Voyager in battle, with Dr. Reynolds eventually joining with an EMP device to disable the entity (sentences 25-29).\n5. **The Revelation**: After defeating the Voyager, Dr. Reynolds discovers that more alien spacecraft are headed towards Earth (sentence 33).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **At the Discovery**: Dr. Reynolds is in a state of scientific curiosity and excitement, having encountered something unprecedented. Her condition is one of professional engagement and intrigue.\n- **After the Explosion**: Her state shifts dramatically to one of shock, grief, and survival. She and Thompson are the only survivors of their team, marking a significant downturn in her condition.\n- **During the Pursuit**: Dr. Reynolds is driven by a sense of urgency and responsibility, knowing the danger the Voyager poses. Her condition improves slightly as she focuses on finding a solution, but the overall situation remains dire.\n- **During the Battle**: She is under immense pressure and risk, fighting for the survival of humanity. This is a critical low point, as the success of their mission is far from guaranteed, and the stakes are extremely high.\n- **After the Revelation**: Despite the immediate victory over the Voyager, Dr. Reynolds' condition takes another downturn as she learns of the impending arrival of more alien spacecraft. This introduces a new, potentially greater threat, leaving her in a state of heightened concern and uncertainty.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the protagonist's condition throughout the story, it starts high with Dr. Reynolds in a position of professional success and curiosity, faces a significant downfall with the explosion and the subsequent pursuit of the Voyager, recovers slightly with the plan to stop it, faces another intense challenge during the battle, and then ends with another significant concern or downfall upon learning of more alien spacecraft approaching. This pattern, where the protagonist starts high, falls, recovers, and then faces another significant downfall, aligns with the **Oedipus** story arc type.\n\n### 4.

However, for the purpose of analyzing the story arc, we can consider Mr. Bronze as the central figure whose actions and decisions significantly impact the plot's progression, especially in the latter half.\n\nThe five major events in the story are:\n1. The four protagonists board the metro train as part of their heist plan (Event 19).\n2. Mr. Crimson identifies an undercover cop on the train, escalating tension (Event 22).\n3. Mr. Bronze aids the cop by sending a coded SMS, revealing details of their heist plan (Event 41).\n4. The team discovers Mr. Bronze's betrayal, leading to a confrontation (Event 51).\n5. The story concludes with a deadly standoff between the remaining team members and the cops, with Mr. Bronze sitting alone, reflecting on his actions (Event 58).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **Event 19 (Boarding the Metro):** Mr. Bronze is part of a cohesive team, working together towards a common goal. His state is one of collaboration and focus on the heist.\n2. **Event 22 (Discovery of the Undercover Cop):** The team's situation becomes tense, but Mr. Bronze's personal state remains one of caution and adherence to the plan. He is still committed to the team's objective.\n3. **Event 41 (Aiding the Cop):** Mr. Bronze's state shifts significantly as he begins to question his morals and eventually decides to betray his team. This marks a turning point in his personal conflict and loyalty.\n4. **Event 51 (Confrontation Due to Betrayal):** Mr. Bronze's state is one of isolation and guilt. His actions have led to a rift within the team, and he faces confrontation and mistrust from his former allies.\n5. **Event 58 (Deadly Standoff):** Mr. Bronze is now alone, both physically and emotionally. His state is reflective, suggesting a deep internal conflict and possibly regret over his decisions.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on Mr. Bronze's condition throughout the story, we observe a significant decline from being part of a united team working towards a goal to being isolated and facing internal turmoil due to his betrayal. His state transitions from collaboration and focus to guilt, isolation, and potential regret. This trajectory aligns with a story arc where the protagonist starts in a relatively high or advantageous position but ends in a significantly lower state, both in terms of their personal relationships and their moral standing.\n\n### 4.

This pattern matches the **Cinderella** story arc, where the protagonist rises, faces a setback, and ultimately achieves a higher state. In Alex's journey, the rise is his decision to be open about his identity and his advocacy, the setback could be considered the challenges he faces (like the confrontation with the gym coach or the potential for backlash), and the ultimate achievement is the widespread acceptance and the success at Prom Night, culminating in a positive change in his school environment.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Tim. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. Tim's blind date with Missy, which ends in disaster (sentence 1-2).\n2. Tim meets another Melissa at the airport and invites her to his work retreat, only to discover he's been texting the wrong Melissa (sentence 3-7).\n3. Missy's antics at the corporate retreat, which initially embarrass Tim but later help him succeed (sentence 10-13).\n4. The revelation that Tim originally wanted to bring someone else to the retreat, leading to Missy's departure (sentence 15-17).\n5. Tim's realization of his feelings for Missy, his attempt to trick her, and their eventual reconciliation (sentence 20-27).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **First Event (Tim's blind date with Missy):** Tim's state is one of initial hope and anticipation for a successful date, which quickly turns to disaster and physical harm (dislocated ankle). His condition worsens due to Missy's behavior.\n\n2. **Second Event (Discovery of the wrong Melissa):** Tim's state goes from excitement and connection with who he thought was the right Melissa to shock, embarrassment, and possibly fear as he realizes his mistake. His condition worsens due to the misunderstanding and Missy's dangerous behavior.\n\n3. **Third Event (Missy's antics at the retreat):** Initially, Tim's state is one of embarrassment and humiliation due to Missy's actions. However, as Missy starts to help him succeed at the retreat, his condition improves. He begins to see her in a different light, and his professional situation improves.\n\n4. **Fourth Event (Revelation and Missy's departure):** Tim's state is one of loss and regret as Missy leaves upon discovering the truth about his intentions. His condition worsens emotionally as he realizes what he might have lost.\n\n5. **Fifth Event (Realization and reconciliation):** Tim's state transforms from one of regret and possibly self-destruction (acting outlandishly and getting hurt) to self-awareness and appreciation for Missy's unique qualities. He takes actions to correct his past mistakes, and his condition improves as he reconciles with Missy.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, it starts with Tim in a hopeful state that quickly deteriorates into disaster and embarrassment. However, as the story progresses, despite facing further setbacks and humiliations, Tim's condition improves as he begins to appreciate Missy and eventually wins her back. This pattern suggests that the story follows a **Man in a Hole** arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (or multiple dilemmas) but finds a way out, ending in a better state than at the beginning. The key characteristic of this arc is the protagonist's ability to recover and improve their condition after facing significant challenges.\n\n### 4. Determined Story Arc Type\n\nMan in a Hole"

However, he quickly decides to continue, showing resilience. His condition worsens temporarily due to the betrayal but then stabilizes as he decides to proceed alone.\n- **At Event 4 (Uncovering the Truth)**: John is in a dangerous and precarious situation, having uncovered a large conspiracy. Despite the risks, he feels a sense of accomplishment and conviction in his mission. His condition improves as he gains more knowledge and feels he is doing the right thing, despite the dangers.\n- **At Event 5 (Receiving Edward's Posthumous Letter)**: John is once again thrust into a state of urgency and danger, forced to confront a new threat. However, he is determined and ready to act, showing growth and a continued commitment to justice. His condition, while challenging, reflects his readiness to face new challenges, indicating an overall improvement in his proactive stance against adversity.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the events and the protagonist's state at each, the story arc can be analyzed as follows:\n\n- John starts in a peaceful retirement, which is disrupted (a low point).\n- He then embarks on a risky mission, faces betrayal, but continues with determination (a cycle of dilemma and recovery).\n- After uncovering the truth and facing significant danger, John achieves a form of victory, though at personal cost (another recovery).\n- Finally, he is thrust into a new challenge but is ready and determined to face it (another cycle of potential dilemma and intended recovery).\n\nThis pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist faces multiple challenges, recovers, and grows, only to face another challenge. This is characteristic of the **Double Man in a Hole** story arc, where the protagonist experiences two cycles of falling into a dilemma and then recovering.\n\n### 4.

Billy convinces Sam to host a Halloween party, which ends in disaster (sentences 9-14).\n4. Sam discovers the truth about Billy's intentions and witnesses the horrific actions of the aliens, leading her to take action to rescue her brother and friends (sentences 18-23).\n5. The final confrontation and resolution, including the defeat of the aliens and the subsequent capture by the armed soldiers (sentences 29-37).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **Event 1 (Sam becomes enamored with Billy):** Sam's state is one of infatuation and hope for a relationship. She is in a relatively positive state, looking forward to potentially impressing Billy.\n2. **Event 2 (Sam's parents ground her):** Sam's state worsens as she feels restricted and possibly ashamed due to being grounded. However, she sees this as an opportunity to change and impress Billy, so there's a mix of negative feelings and hopeful anticipation.\n3. **Event 3 (The Halloween party disaster):** Sam's state deteriorates significantly as she realizes Billy's true intentions and faces physical threats from him. She is betrayed, scared, and embarrassed.\n4. **Event 4 (Sam takes action against the aliens):** Sam's state improves as she finds the courage to act against the aliens to save her brother and friends. She is determined, brave, and proactive, indicating a positive shift in her condition.\n5. **Event 5 (Final confrontation and resolution):** Sam's state becomes complex; she experiences relief and possibly pride in helping to defeat the aliens but then faces uncertainty and fear as she and her friends are captured by the soldiers. This capture and the subsequent events leave her in a state of vulnerability and uncertainty.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the changes in Sam's state throughout the story:\n- She starts in a hopeful, positive state (enamored with Billy).\n- Her state worsens as she faces grounding, betrayal, and physical threats ( Events 2 and 3).\n- She then experiences an improvement in her state as she takes action against the aliens (Event 4).\n- Finally, her state becomes one of vulnerability and uncertainty as she is captured (Event 5).\n\nThis pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist starts in a relatively good position, falls into difficulties, recovers to some extent, but then faces another significant challenge or downfall. This does not perfectly fit the \"Riches to Rags\" classification provided, as that implies a consistent decline from a high starting point to a low ending point without significant recovery. Instead, Sam's journey involves a rise, a fall, a recovery, and then another complication, which more closely aligns with the \"Oedipus\" story arc type, where the protagonist starts high, falls, recovers, and then faces another downfall.\n\n### 4.

For the purpose of analyzing the story arc, we will consider David as the primary protagonist.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n- Event 1: David and Sarah start their new life together in Toronto, filled with optimism and ambition ( Sentence 1).\n- Event 2: The couple begins to experience unexplained phenomena in their apartment, such as finding items in unlikely places and hearing strange noises (Sentences 4 and 5).\n- Event 3: David discovers a hidden camera in their living room, revealing an invasive breach of their privacy (Sentence 11).\n- Event 4: The Edwards confess to being private investigators hired by David's presumed dead sister, Lisa, who has been searching for him (Sentence 15).\n- Event 5: David reunites with Lisa and learns about the multimillion-dollar inheritance awaiting him, transforming his life (Sentence 20).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1:** David is in a high state, newly married and starting a new life with optimism and ambition. His condition is positive, looking forward to building a life with Sarah.\n- **Event 2:** David's state begins to deteriorate as he and Sarah experience strange occurrences in their apartment. This introduces uncertainty and unease into their lives, making his condition less positive than at the start.\n- **Event 3:** The discovery of the hidden camera significantly worsens David's state. He feels violated and concerned about their privacy, marking a low point in his condition.\n- **Event 4:** Learning the truth about the Edwards and the reason for their actions slightly improves David's state. Although the violation of privacy is disturbing, the revelation that it was part of a search for him by a sister he thought was dead introduces a mix of emotions, including hope and curiosity.\n- **Event 5:** David's state improves dramatically as he reunites with his sister and learns about his inheritance. This event marks a significant positive turn in his life, both emotionally and financially.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the analysis of David's condition throughout the story, we observe that he starts in a high state (newly married and optimistic), falls into a dilemma (experiencing strange phenomena and the violation of privacy), and then finds a way out that leads to an even better state than where he began (reuniting with his sister and gaining an inheritance). This pattern matches the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc type, where the protagonist falls into a problem but ends up in a better situation than at the start.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is John Gordon. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Introduction to John's High-Stakes Conversation** (Sentence 2-3): John is introduced, deeply engaged in a crucial phone call regarding his potential position as Managing Director within the Empire.\n2. **Emily's Investigation and John's Anxiety** (Sentence 5-7): Emily starts investigating John, leading to an increase in his anxiety levels as she probes into his personal and professional life.\n3. **Discovery of Threats to the Empire** (Sentence 10-12): John discovers mysterious letters and cryptic messages hinting at a danger shadowing the Empire, which further escalates his situation.\n4. **Confronting the Conspiracy** (Sentence 18-20): John confronts the mastermind behind the threats, and he and Emily decide to unite forces against their common enemy.\n5. **Resolution and New Beginning** (Sentence 21-25): John successfully uncovers the traitors, saves the Empire, and earns the position of Managing Director, marking a significant improvement in his condition.\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: John is in a state of high stakes, striving for a prestigious position. His condition is one of ambition and slight uncertainty.\n- **Event 2**: With Emily's investigation, John's state changes to one of increased anxiety and defensiveness, indicating a deterioration in his comfort and security.\n- **Event 3**: Upon discovering the threats to the Empire, John's state worsens as he faces not only personal scrutiny but also professional danger, plunging him into a deeper dilemma.\n- **Event 4**: When John decides to confront the conspiracy, his state begins to shift towards action and determination. Although he's still in a precarious situation, he's taking control, which is a step towards recovery.\n- **Event 5**: After resolving the conspiracy and achieving his goal, John's state improves dramatically. He's succeeded in his professional aspirations and has also gained respect and admiration, marking a significant positive change from his initial state.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the narrative. Initially, John is in a high-stakes situation but not necessarily in a bad state. He then falls into a deeper dilemma due to Emily's investigation and the discovery of threats to the Empire. However, he manages to find a way out of these problems by confronting the conspiracy and eventually succeeds in his goals, ending in a better state than where he started.\n\nThis pattern aligns with the **Man in a Hole** story arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma and then finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning. John's journey from facing personal and professional challenges to overcoming them and achieving success fits this archetype.\n\n### 4. Determined Story Arc Type\n\nMan in a Hole"

This pattern of rising to a challenge, facing a setback, and then ultimately achieving a higher state than where he started aligns with the **Cinderella** story arc type. The Cinderella arc is characterized by the protagonist's rise, a temporary fall or setback, and then a final rise to a higher state than before, which matches Arthur's journey from an ambitious youth to a hero who saves his village.\n\n### 4.

Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the changes in Zoey's state throughout the story, it seems that her condition starts with a sense of empowerment and readiness for challenge. However, as the story progresses, she faces numerous setbacks, dangers, and emotional challenges. Despite moments of relief and small victories, the overall trajectory of her condition is one of worsening circumstances, especially considering the final event where she is once again trapped in an escape room. This pattern does not fit the \"Rags to Riches,\" \"Man in a Hole,\" \"Cinderella,\" or \"Double Man in a Hole\" story arcs, as those typically involve an overall improvement in the protagonist's condition by the end. It also doesn't perfectly match \"Icarus\" or \"Oedipus,\" as those involve a rise followed by a fall, but Zoey's story is more about a series of challenges and dangers that escalate rather than a rise and fall. The closest match based on the provided description and the story's progression is \"Riches to Rags,\" as Zoey's condition worsens from the beginning to the end, considering her final state of being trapped again.\n\n### 4.

For the purpose of analysis, we'll consider their collective experience as the protagonist's journey. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **The brothers learn about the hospital's plan to relocate their mother** (sentence 5): This event sets the stage for the brothers' desperation and motivates their subsequent actions.\n2. **Alex reveals his plan to plunder the mercenary's mansion** (sentence 7): This marks a turning point where the brothers decide to take drastic action to solve their problems.\n3. **The brothers initiate their mission to break into the mercenary's mansion** (sentence 10): This event signifies the brothers' commitment to their plan and the beginning of their risky adventure.\n4. **The brothers discover the hidden vault but decide to prioritize their lives over wealth** (sentence 14): This event shows a significant decision-making point where the brothers choose survival and helping their mother over gaining wealth.\n5. **The brothers escape the mansion and use the stolen medical equipment to stabilize their mother's condition** (sentences 15-16): This final event concludes the brothers' adventure and shows the positive outcome of their actions.\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1 (sentence 5)**: The brothers are in a state of desperation and fear due to their mother's health and financial issues. Their condition is low.\n- **Event 2 (sentence 7)**: The brothers' condition slightly improves as they find hope in Alex's plan, showing a proactive approach to their problems.\n- **Event 3 (sentence 10)**: The brothers' condition becomes more precarious as they embark on a dangerous mission, filled with uncertainty and risk.\n- **Event 4 (sentence 14)**: Despite the risks, the brothers' condition improves as they find valuable medical equipment that can help their mother, showing a potential way out of their dilemma.\n- **Event 5 (sentences 15-16)**: The brothers' condition improves significantly as they successfully use the medical equipment to help their mother and begin to mend their relationship, despite lingering fears.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story follows the \"Man in a Hole\" arc because the protagonists start in a difficult situation (their mother's illness and debt), fall into a deeper dilemma (the risky decision to break into the mansion and the subsequent complications), and then find a way out that improves their condition (successfully obtaining medical equipment to help their mother). This arc type is characterized by the protagonist's condition worsening before it improves, which is evident in the brothers' journey from desperation and danger to a more stable and hopeful situation.\n\n### 4.

he was an undercover agent, planted by none other than Kepler-Dyson to ensure the smooth operation and undisturbed functionality of the nanotech.\n18) Yet, Helen, unyielding to the mounting adversity, surmounts the treacherous actions of Dr. Karl with her unwavering determination and swift problem-solving skills.\n19) Her relentless pursuit finally yields a fruit as she stumbles upon a groundbreaking solution to annihilate the nanotech, but it commanded manual initiation from the massively compromised and hazardous heart of the vessel.\n20) With all too palpable fear stirring within, Alex, a courageous member of the crew, steps into the limelight, volunteering to risk his deteriorating health and the unyielding gravity of the nanotech infection to safeguard the vessel.\n21) As Alex travels deeper into the infested regions of the ship, the screen becomes a haunt for twisted images of his mutating physique, as he transforms into a disturbing cyborg-like figure.\n22) Despite his rapidly eroding physical condition, Alex fights against the torment.\n23) Turning his struggle into a bulwark of resistance, he triggers the programmed nanotech neutralization, battling the horror coursing through his veins.\n24) As Alex's life force dissipates, so does the threat of the nanotech, creating a raw paradox between life and obliteration.\n25) His brave sacrifice ensuring the survival of his teammates and the salvation of their interstellar vessel.\n26) In the wake of the great sacrifice, the Titan turns into a ship of silence, its crew devoting their time to quiet reflection over their chilling encounter and their dead comrade's gallant deed.\n27) A ripple of raw sorrow echoes off Helen's elongated silence as she accurately documents a detailed, evidence-based account of the horrifying events that transpired aboard Titan.\n28) Her words act as a promise for a deeper investigation into the unnerving actions of the Kepler-Dyson Corporation.\n29) As the narrative winds down, the veil of ominous foreboding is cast over the Kepler-Dyson Corporation's sinister future.\n30) The film leaves its audience at the edge of the unnerving abyss, baiting their anxious anticipation for the dark repercussions that were yet to unfold.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better (e.g., 0\u21921\u21922\u21924\u219210)\n- Riches to Rags: Protagonist starts high and ends lower (e.g., 10\u21929\u21928\u21926\u21920)\n- Man in a Hole: Protagonist falls into trouble but recovers (e.g., 6\u21922\u21921\u21924\u219210)\n- Icarus: Protagonist rises then falls dramatically (e.g., 2\u21924\u21929\u21925\u21921)\n- Double Man in a Hole: Two cycles of fall and recovery (e.g., 6\u21922\u21927\u21924\u219210)\n- Cinderella: Rise, setback, ultimate triumph (e.g., 1\u21927\u21924\u21921\u219210)\n- Oedipus: Start high, fall, recover, final fall (e.g., 10\u21924\u21927\u21929\u21921)",
        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Helen, a seasoned systems engineer. Five major events in the story are:\n1. The distress signal is received, and the crew is awakened from hibernation (sentence 5).\n2. Helen discovers the nanotechnological invader taking over the ship's system (sentence 11).\n3. The crew discovers Dr. Karl's duplicitous involvement with the Kepler-Dyson Corporation (sentence 17).\n4. Helen finds a solution to annihilate the nanotech, but it requires manual initiation from the heart of the vessel (sentence 19).\n5. Alex sacrifices himself to initiate the nanotech neutralization, saving the crew and the ship (sentences 20-25).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **Event 1 (Distress Signal):** Helen's state changes from calm and possibly unaware of the impending danger to alerted and ready to face the challenge. She moves from a state of serenity to one of urgency and action.\n2. **Event 2 (Discovery of Nanotech Invader):** Helen's state worsens as she realizes the severity of the situation. She moves from being ready to face a challenge to being confronted with a potentially catastrophic problem that threatens the entire crew and ship.\n3. **Event 3 (Dr. Karl's Betrayal):** Helen's state becomes even more dire as she learns of Dr. Karl's involvement with the enemy. This betrayal complicates the situation, making it not just a technical problem but also a matter of trust and loyalty within the crew.\n4. **Event 4 (Solution to Annihilate Nanotech):** Helen's state slightly improves as she finds a potential solution to their problem. However, the solution requires a risky and dangerous action, which still keeps the overall situation tense and uncertain.\n5. **Event 5 (Alex's Sacrifice):** Helen's state, along with the crew's, is marked by sadness and loss due to Alex's sacrifice. However, they also experience relief and gratitude because the ship and most of the crew are saved. This event brings a sense of closure and resolution to the crisis, albeit at a significant cost.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc can be classified based on how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the narrative. Initially, Helen is in a state of readiness and competence. As the story progresses, she faces significant challenges (the nanotech invader, Dr. Karl's betrayal) that worsen her situation. However, she never gives up and continues to work towards a solution. The story reaches its climax with Alex's sacrifice, which is a tragic event but also leads to the resolution of the main conflict. After this event, Helen and the remaining crew are in a state of reflection and mourning but are also safe and on the path to recovery.\n\nGiven these changes, the story follows a pattern where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (receiving the distress signal and discovering the nanotech invader) and then finds a way out (Helen's relentless pursuit of a solution and Alex's ultimate sacrifice). The protagonist's condition improves from the lowest point (after discovering Dr. Karl's betrayal and before finding a solution) to the final state (having saved the ship but at a great personal cost).\n\n### 4.

the miniaturized model undergoes a rapid metamorphosis, expanding into an impeccably replicated full-scale G-19 Hawk aircraft bursting with tiny, proportionate passengers.\n7) Taking everyone off guard, the plane's engines thunder into action, propelling it gliding across his living room floor and out through his unanticipatedly large, Victorian-era bay window.\n8) The pilotless aircraft miraculously navigates its way around the city's towering skyline, demonstrating swift and precise maneuvering skills while earning incredulous stares from the city's bustling crowd of residents.\n9) Fearful of the potential catastrophe an errant, uncontrolled aircraft could cause in a densely populated city, Daryl along with a bewildered Chloe conjure up a hasty but essential plan for their impromptu mission - Locate and recover the full-size airplane model now darting around their city.\n10) Their compelling mission takes them on a wild chase across bustling city squares, tucked-away back alleys, and iconic green parks of their own city, hidden corners of which were until then unknown to them.\n11) All the while, they keep an eager eye out for any sightings of the erratic G-19 Hawk.\n12) Their fast-paced adventure intersects the lives of the varied city populace including curious corporate employees, perturbed pedestrians, and wide-eyed children, all expressing their individual reactions to the gasp-worthy spectacle unfolding right before their eyes.\n13) This little plane, which has now become a cherished city celebrity, selects the grand statue of the city's founding mayor as its operational base.\n14) The aircraft's acrobatic stunts around the statue invoke contagious laughter and energetic conversations amongst the onlooking crowd.\n15) Taking note of the palpable joy his inadvertent creation is stirring up, Daryl is confronted with a challenging decision: to put an end to the mini-plane's aerial shenanigans forever or to let it continue.\n16) In the end, he puts a responsible foot forward by deciding to return the lovable airplane and its tiny occupants to their original miniature state using the remaining bit of Gulliver's Juice.\n17) When the gliding airplane takes a playful plunge towards Daryl's duo, he strategically tosses the potion onto it.\n18) This sets off a breathtaking mid-air magical transition where the plane is briefly shrouded in cascading shimmers of stardust before gradually shrinking down to a fraction of its size.\n19) The G-19 Hawk, post its enchanting journey across the city skies, returns to its original miniature size, along with its troop of diminutive passengers, and gently descends into Daryl's welcoming palms.\n20) Amidst deafening cheers and the infectious laughter of the onlooking crowd, a triumphant Daryl and an out-of-breath Chloe make their jovial return home.\n21) Their chaotic pursuit lasting an entire day which turned into an unexpected citywide entertainment.\n22) Once back in the tranquility of their home, they decide to memorialize the day's adventure by strategically positioning the G-19 Hawk model alongside Daryl's meticulously crafted miniatures atop their mantle.\n23) As the strange day finally comes to a close, it concludes with a merry audience still relishing the surprises thrown their way during the day, etching a memorable imprint on the fascinatingly entertaining day.\n24) As the madness of the day finally subsides, Daryl and Chloe find themselves caught up in bouts of roaring laughter reminiscing about the ridiculous situations they encountered all courtesy of their mini-passenger packed G-19 Hawk, their laughter proving to be a fitting melody echoing throughout their apartment.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better (e.g., 0\u21921\u21922\u21924\u219210)\n- Riches to Rags: Protagonist starts high and ends lower (e.g., 10\u21929\u21928\u21926\u21920)\n- Man in a Hole: Protagonist falls into trouble but recovers (e.g., 6\u21922\u21921\u21924\u219210)\n- Icarus: Protagonist rises then falls dramatically (e.g., 2\u21924\u21929\u21925\u21921)\n- Double Man in a Hole: Two cycles of fall and recovery (e.g., 6\u21922\u21927\u21924\u219210)\n- Cinderella: Rise, setback, ultimate triumph (e.g., 1\u21927\u21924\u21921\u219210)\n- Oedipus: Start high, fall, recover, final fall (e.g., 10\u21924\u21927\u21929\u21921)",

Daryl purchases the blueprint of a G-19 Hawk model airplane.\n2. Daryl's existence becomes dominated by the model, causing him to skip meals and sleep, leading to concern from his roommate Chloe.\n3. Daryl inadvertently spills \"Gulliver's Juice\" on the model, causing it to transform into a full-scale aircraft.\n4. Daryl and Chloe embark on a mission to locate and recover the full-size airplane model as it navigates the city.\n5. Daryl decides to return the airplane to its miniature state using the remaining Gulliver's Juice.\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: Daryl is in a state of fascination and hobbyist interest. His condition is one of curiosity and engagement, which is a positive state.\n- **Event 2**: Daryl's condition worsens as his obsession with the model starts to negatively impact his health and relationships. This indicates a decline in his overall well-being.\n- **Event 3**: The accidental transformation of the model into a full-scale aircraft introduces chaos and unpredictability into Daryl's life. His state becomes one of surprise and potential trouble, which is a low point.\n- **Event 4**: Daryl and Chloe's mission to recover the airplane model is a response to the chaos introduced in the previous event. Daryl's state is one of action and problem-solving, indicating an attempt to regain control over the situation. This can be seen as a step towards recovery from the previous low point.\n- **Event 5**: By deciding to return the airplane to its miniature state, Daryl takes a responsible step that resolves the chaos and allows him to regain control over his life. This decision leads to a positive outcome, where Daryl and Chloe are hailed as part of a citywide entertainment, and they end the day on a note of laughter and memorialization of their adventure.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. Initially, Daryl is in a positive state (curiosity and engagement with the model). His condition then worsens (obsession negatively impacting his life), followed by a significant downturn (chaos with the full-scale aircraft). However, he then takes action to solve the problem (mission to recover the airplane), and finally, he makes a decision that leads to a positive resolution (returning the airplane to its miniature state and enjoying the aftermath).\n\nThis pattern follows the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (the chaos with the airplane) and then finds a way out, ending in a better state than before the dilemma began. Daryl's condition improves from the point of the airplane's transformation to the final resolution, where he not only resolves the immediate problem but also ends up with a memorable and positive experience.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Jodie Snyman, a Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (DPCI) officer. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. Jodie finds a murdered man with initials carved on his body, leading to the discovery of a complex case involving human trafficking and corruption (sentence 7).\n2. Jodie discovers that the initials on the dead body are connected to one of the six missing girls abducted by Gert de Jager, hinting at a larger conspiracy (sentence 10).\n3. Jodie uncovers a syndicate of sex trafficking cartels with the help of a hooded killer and begins to work towards cleaning up the society, albeit through unlawful means (sentence 14).\n4. Jodie learns about her colleague Ntombizonke's past and her connection to the case, including being a victim of sexual assault by FJ Nolte, and finds the recorded tape left by Ntombizonke (sentences 16-19).\n5. Jodie's attempt to intercept the sale of young girls to an Iranian Sheikh results in the death of Ntombizonke and another coworker, leading Jodie to take the law into her own hands, killing FJ Nolte and planning to go after the Iranian Sheikh (sentences 22-27).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Jodie is in a state of frustration due to the lack of progress in her human trafficking raids. The discovery of the murdered man and the initials carved on his body presents her with a new, intriguing case that could potentially lead to significant breakthroughs in her work.\n- **Event 2**: Jodie's state shifts from mere investigation to a deeper emotional investment as she uncovers the connection between the current case and the historical abduction of six girls. This realization likely increases her determination to solve the case.\n- **Event 3**: With the uncovering of the sex trafficking syndicate, Jodie's state changes to one of active pursuit of justice, even if it means operating outside the law. This shows a rise in her proactive stance against crime.\n- **Event 4**: Learning about Ntombizonke's past and her connection to the case adds a personal layer to Jodie's investigation. Her state becomes more emotionally complex, with feelings of betrayal, sadness, and a deeper resolve to bring the perpetrators to justice.\n- **Event 5**: After the death of her colleagues and her decision to take the law into her own hands, Jodie's state transforms into one of vengeance and self-appointed justice. She transitions from a law enforcement officer to a vigilante, marking a significant change in her approach and personal risk.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on Jodie's condition throughout the story, it's clear that she faces multiple challenges and setbacks (being in a difficult situation with her operation, uncovering dark secrets, losing colleagues) but also experiences moments of resolve and action (deciding to work outside the law, killing FJ Nolte, planning to go after the Iranian Sheikh). Her journey involves falling into dilemmas (the moral complexity of her actions, the loss of colleagues) and finding ways out, albeit through risky and unlawful means. This pattern of facing challenges, recovering, and then facing another set of challenges before ultimately taking a stand and acting, even if it means going against the law, suggests a story arc that involves cycles of dilemma and recovery.\n\n### 4.

try to arrest Stanley again claiming his real identity as The Mask.\n33) Mayor Tilton arrives and debunks Kellaway's claims by announcing that Tyrell was The Mask the whole time because he was one of the victims that was taken hostage by the thug at Coco Bongo.\n34) He tells Stanley that he is a hero, thanks him for saving lives, and orders the police to release him.\n35) In a desperate attempt to prove Stanley was The Mask, Kellaway and Doyle try to claim off Milo for assisting in his escape, but Tilton is not in the mood for their antics.\n36) He goes on to say that he will need to meet with

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Sebasti\u00e1n Silva, a depressed, ketamine-addicted artist and filmmaker. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. Sebasti\u00e1n meets Jordan Firstman at a gay nude beach after nearly drowning.\n2. Jordan posts a video of Sebasti\u00e1n snorting ketamine on social media without his permission, leading to a confrontation.\n3. Sebasti\u00e1n agrees to work with Jordan on his television project after mentioning it to HBO executives.\n4. Sebasti\u00e1n falls to his death from the rooftop while moving a couch for Jordan.\n5. The truth about Sebasti\u00e1n's death is slowly uncovered, with Vero eventually confessing her role in covering it up.\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Sebasti\u00e1n is in a vulnerable state, having nearly drowned and being a depressed, ketamine-addicted individual. His condition is precarious, and this event sets the stage for his interactions with Jordan.\n- **Event 2**: Sebasti\u00e1n's state worsens as he is publicly embarrassed by Jordan's actions, highlighting his addiction and potentially damaging his professional reputation. This event shows a decline in Sebasti\u00e1n's condition due to external factors beyond his control.\n- **Event 3**: Despite the previous setback, Sebasti\u00e1n sees an opportunity in working with Jordan and potentially reviving his career. This could be seen as a slight improvement in his state, as he is taking action towards a positive change.\n- **Event 4**: Sebasti\u00e1n's death marks the ultimate low point in his condition. It's a tragic end to his struggles with addiction and depression, exacerbated by the circumstances of his accident.\n- **Event 5**: While Sebasti\u00e1n is deceased by this point, the uncovering of the truth about his death and the circumstances surrounding it can be seen as a form of resolution or closure for the characters involved, particularly Vero and Sebasti\u00e1n's brother, Juan. However, for Sebasti\u00e1n himself, his condition cannot change as he is deceased.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the progression of Sebasti\u00e1n's condition throughout the story, it starts at a low point with Sebasti\u00e1n being depressed and addicted, sees a brief potential for improvement when he considers working with Jordan, but ultimately ends in tragedy with his death. This pattern does not fit the typical \"Rags to Riches\" or \"Cinderella\" story arcs, which require an overall improvement in the protagonist's condition by the end. It also doesn't fit \"Man in a Hole\" or \"Double Man in a Hole,\" as Sebasti\u00e1n does not recover from his dilemmas in a way that improves his condition by the story's conclusion. The \"Icarus\" story arc, which involves a rise followed by a drastic fall, might seem applicable, but Sebasti\u00e1n's condition at the beginning is already quite low, and while there's a brief potential for rise, it's not a significant enough climb to warrant this classification. The \"Oedipus\" story arc, involving a fall, recovery, and then another significant downfall, also doesn't apply because Sebasti\u00e1n's story lacks a significant recovery phase before his final downfall.\n\nThe \"Riches to Rags\" classification provided seems incorrect based on the typical definition of this story arc, which involves a protagonist starting in a high status and ending in a lower one. Sebasti\u00e1n starts in a low state and ends in an even lower state (death), which doesn't align with the traditional \"Riches to Rags\" narrative.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Robert Bleichner, a high school student and aspiring cartoonist. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Meeting with Mr. Katano and the subsequent death of Mr. Katano (sentences 1-5)**: This event sets the stage for Robert's journey, showing his initial aspirations and the sudden loss of his mentor.\n2. **Robert's decision to pursue a career in art and his move to independence (sentences 12-13)**: This marks a significant turning point where Robert decides to leave his comfort zone and pursue his dreams, despite his parents' disappointment.\n3. **Robert's involvement with Wallace, including the attempted assault on the pharmacist (sentences 15-22)**: This event introduces a new challenge and moral dilemma for Robert, testing his character and decision-making.\n4. **The drawing lesson with Wallace and the ensuing chaos (sentences 24-34)**: This event represents a peak in Robert's troubles, where his attempts to learn from Wallace end in disaster, including violence and betrayal.\n5. **The aftermath of the chaos with Wallace, where Robert ends up bruised and contemplating his situation (sentences 35-37)**: This final event shows Robert at a low point, physically and emotionally, reflecting on the consequences of his actions and decisions.\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Robert starts in a state of aspiration and potential, seeking guidance from Mr. Katano. The sudden death of Mr. Katano leaves Robert in a state of loss and uncertainty.\n- **Event 2**: Robert decides to take control of his life, pursuing art and independence. This move suggests an improvement in his state, as he's taking proactive steps towards his goals, albeit with the risk of uncertainty and potential failure.\n- **Event 3**: Robert's involvement with Wallace introduces a significant downturn. Robert becomes entangled in unethical and dangerous situations, indicating a worsening of his state as he compromises his values and safety.\n- **Event 4**: The situation with Wallace escalates, leading to violence and betrayal. This represents a further decline in Robert's state, as he faces physical harm and emotional distress.\n- **Event 5**: After the chaos, Robert is left broken and bruised, both physically and emotionally. This event signifies a low point for Robert, where he must confront the consequences of his decisions and the state of his life.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the progression of Robert's state throughout the story, we observe an initial pursuit of dreams and independence (an improvement), followed by a series of deteriorating events involving Wallace, which lead to a significant downfall (a worsening of his state). This pattern, where the protagonist starts in a relatively positive state, faces a series of challenges that lead to a decline, and ends in a lower state than where he began, aligns with the **Oedipus** story arc type. The Oedipus arc is characterized by a protagonist who starts high, falls, recovers, and then faces another significant downfall. In Robert's case, his decision to pursue art and his initial steps towards independence can be seen as a high point, followed by a fall into trouble with Wallace, a brief attempt to recover through seeking guidance, and then another downfall into violence and betrayal.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To analyze the story arc, let's first identify the protagonist and major events in the story.\n\nThe protagonist of the story can be considered as a collective entity, primarily focusing on Dominic Forrester and Edward Locke, as the story revolves around their actions, rivalry, and eventual alliance.\n\nHere are 5 major events in the story:\n\n1. **The Initial Encounter**: Dominic and Edward meet at a Wall Street business gala, despite their past tensions (sentences 1-3).\n2. **The Tragedy and Rivalry**: Tragedy strikes, and unexpected deaths occur, leading to a rivalry between Dominic and Edward as they try to uncover the truth (sentences 5-6).\n3. **The Reluctant Alliance**: Dominic and Edward put aside their animosity and form an alliance to expose and bring down their common adversary (sentences 9-10).\n4. **The Discovery and Confrontation**: They discover that the city mayor, Henry Davidson, is behind the tragic events and devise a plan to thwart his intentions (sentences 14-16).\n5. **The Victory and New Beginning**: They successfully expose Davidson, leading to his downfall, and subsequently, Dominic and Edward take on leadership roles, ushering in a new era for New York City (sentences 21-27).\n\nNow, let's describe the protagonist's state at each event and how it changed relative to the previous events:\n\n- At the **Initial Encounter**, the protagonist (Dominic and Edward) is in a state of tension and rivalry, but still in positions of power and influence.\n- As the story progresses to **The Tragedy and Rivalry**, their state worsens due to the unexpected deaths and the escalation of their rivalry, placing them in a more challenging and dangerous situation.\n- With **The Reluctant Alliance**, their state improves slightly as they find common ground and work together, marking a turning point where they begin to regain control over their situation.\n- During **The Discovery and Confrontation**, their state becomes more determined and proactive as they uncover the truth and plan to confront their adversary, showing significant improvement from their previous state of rivalry and tragedy.\n- Finally, at **The Victory and New Beginning**, their state reaches a high point as they achieve victory over their adversary, and they emerge as leaders, bringing about a positive change to their city.\n\nGiven these observations, the story arc type can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout. The protagonist starts in a relatively high state (in terms of social position and influence), falls into a dilemma (tragedy and rivalry), and then finds a way out, ending in an even better state (victory and leadership). This pattern matches the **Man in a Hole** story arc, where the protagonist faces a significant challenge, overcomes it, and emerges in a better condition than at the start.\n\nMan in a Hole"

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Victor Sanchez, a young man working as a janitor with a passion for football. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. Victor and Lily infiltrate the Super Bowl, inspiring Victor's ambition to become a professional football player (sentence 10-12).\n2. Victor persuades the school to introduce a football program, marking the beginning of his journey to assemble a team (sentence 16).\n3. The team presents a financial plan to the school board but is met with rejection, leaving them without funds but more determined (sentence 21).\n4. The team, under Coach Harvey's guidance, improves and gains respect and admiration from the student population and the town (sentence 25-26).\n5. Victor leads his team to a spectacular victory in the state championships against the 'Arlington Knights' (sentence 34).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **Infiltrating the Super Bowl**: Victor's state changes from being an unrecognized aspirant to having a sparked ambition. He moves from merely watching football to considering a career in it, marking an initial rise in his condition from a state of unfulfilled potential to inspired action.\n\n2. **Persuading the School**: Victor's condition improves as he transitions from a mere dreamer to a doer, taking concrete steps towards his goal by convincing the school to start a football program. This shows an increase in his determination and proactive approach to achieving his ambitions.\n\n3. **Facing Rejection**: Despite the setback of being denied funding, Victor's determination deepens. His condition, in terms of morale and resolve, might seem to dip momentarily due to the rejection, but his reaction to the setback (becoming more determined) indicates an underlying growth in resilience and commitment to his goals.\n\n4. **Team Improvement under Coach Harvey**: Victor's state significantly improves as the team progresses under professional guidance. He gains respect, improves his skills, and builds stronger relationships, notably with Lily. This period marks a substantial upward trend in his condition, both personally and in terms of his football career.\n\n5. **Victory in the State Championships**: At this point, Victor achieves a pinnacle of success, leading his team to victory against significant odds. His condition, in terms of achievement, recognition, and personal fulfillment, reaches its highest point in the story. He has transformed from an underappreciated janitor with a secret passion for football to a celebrated athlete and leader.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be determined by analyzing the trajectory of Victor's condition throughout the narrative. Initially, Victor is in a disadvantaged situation (working as a janitor, lacking recognition for his football talents). However, after the turning point at the Super Bowl, his condition begins to improve as he takes steps towards his ambitions. Despite facing setbacks (like the rejection of their financial plan), Victor's determination and resilience grow, leading to significant improvements in his personal and professional life. The story culminates in Victor achieving a high point of success and recognition, both in his football career and personally.\n\nGiven this trajectory, the story fits the **Man in a Hole** arc, as Victor falls into a dilemma (his unrecognized potential and disadvantaged situation) and then finds a way out, ending in a better condition than where he started. The key characteristic of this arc is the protagonist's condition improving from the first turning point to the last, which is evident in Victor's journey from an inspired aspirant to a successful and recognized athlete and individual.\n\n### 4.

Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Lisa's Disappearance**: The event where Lisa goes missing at the gas station, marking the beginning of Will's desperate search.\n2. **Discovery of the Security Footage**: Will retrieves the CCTV recorder from the gas station and views the footage with Detective Paterson, learning more about Lisa's disappearance.\n3. **Confrontation with Knuckles**: Will breaks into Knuckles' trailer, fights him, and learns that Knuckles was forced to leave Lisa with someone named Frank.\n4. **Infiltration of Frank's Camp**: Will finds and infiltrates Frank's drug lab camp in the woods, leading to a firefight and the death of Frank and one of his men.\n5. **Reunion with Lisa**: Will finds Lisa alive in a shed near the camp after the building explodes, and they are reunited.\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **At Event 1 (Lisa's Disappearance)**: Will's state changes from normalcy to panic and desperation as he realizes his wife is missing. This marks a significant downturn in his condition.\n- **At Event 2 (Discovery of the Security Footage)**: Will's state becomes more determined and hopeful as he gains his first real lead in finding Lisa. His condition slightly improves as he feels he is making progress.\n- **At Event 3 (Confrontation with Knuckles)**: Will's state is one of aggression and urgency, driven by his desire to find Lisa. This event keeps him in a state of distress but with a newfound determination to rescue his wife.\n- **At Event 4 (Infiltration of Frank's Camp)**: Will's state is dangerous and risky, as he faces significant threats to his life. However, he is driven by the hope of finding Lisa, which motivates him to take these risks. His condition is precarious but with a glimmer of hope.\n- **At Event 5 (Reunion with Lisa)**: Will's state improves dramatically as he finds Lisa alive. This marks a significant upturn in his condition, returning him to a state of happiness and relief after a series of distressing events.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the story. Initially, Will is in a good state, but his condition worsens significantly with Lisa's disappearance. He then embarks on a journey to find her, facing numerous challenges and dangers, which represents a \"hole\" or a low point. Eventually, he finds Lisa alive, which marks a significant improvement in his condition, returning him to a better state than where he started.\n\nThis pattern fits the **Man in a Hole** story arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (Lisa's disappearance and the challenges of finding her) and then finds a way out, ending in a better condition than at the beginning (being reunited with Lisa).\n\n### 4.

Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. The arrival of a message in a bottle revealing the King's search for his lost daughter (sentence 4).\n2. Lily discovering her true identity as the missing princess (sentence 9).\n3. Lily deciding to reveal her identity to the King and sending a response (sentence 12).\n4. The attempted abduction of Lily by the court advisor during the royal celebration (sentence 20).\n5. The final exposure of the advisor's treachery and Lily's reunion with her father, the King (sentences 24-28).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1:** At the arrival of the message, Lily's state changes from a tranquil, albeit curious, existence to one filled with curiosity and questioning about her past. Her condition is sparked with intrigue but remains relatively stable in terms of her overall well-being and knowledge about herself.\n\n- **Event 2:** Upon discovering her true identity, Lily's state shifts dramatically from being an unaware, humble ward of Benjamin to being aware of her royal lineage. This revelation brings both excitement and uncertainty, potentially improving her condition in terms of knowledge and potential future opportunities but also introducing confusion and the need for adjustment.\n\n- **Event 3:** When Lily decides to reveal her identity, her state shows courage and determination. She moves from a place of discovery to one of action, taking control of her newfound knowledge. This decision sets her on a path that could potentially lead to a better life, improving her condition from one of ignorance to one of empowerment.\n\n- **Event 4:** The attempted abduction places Lily in a state of danger and vulnerability. Her condition worsens as she faces a significant threat to her safety and well-being. This event represents a downturn in her story, where her actions and decisions lead to a risky and potentially harmful situation.\n\n- **Event 5:** Finally, with the exposure of the advisor's treachery and her reunion with the King, Lily's state improves as she finds safety, acceptance, and a sense of belonging. Her condition is better than at the beginning, as she has not only discovered her true identity but has also navigated the challenges associated with it and found a positive resolution.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, it can be observed that Lily starts in a relatively stable, albeit ignorant, state. She then experiences a rise with the discovery of her true identity and the potential it brings, followed by a setback when she faces danger and abduction. Ultimately, she achieves a higher state than where she began, with a newfound understanding of herself, a reunion with her father, and an acceptance of her royal lineage.\n\nThis pattern of rising, facing a setback, and ultimately achieving a higher state aligns with the **Cinderella** story arc type. The Cinderella arc is characterized by the protagonist's journey from a lower state to a higher one, often marked by a significant challenge or setback before achieving success or happiness. In Lily's case, her journey from an unaware, humble existence to discovering her royalty, facing danger, and then finding acceptance and reunion with her father mirrors this arc.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To analyze the story arc, let's first identify the protagonist and key events in the story.\n\n1. **Identify the Protagonist and Major Events:**\n   - The protagonist of the story is Bee, a working-class young woman from Eastern Europe.\n   - Five major events in the story are:\n     1. Bee arrives at the mansion for the \"hurricane party\" (sentence 1).\n     2. The group plays \"Bodies Bodies Bodies,\" and shortly after, they discover David's dead body (sentences 4-7).\n     3. Bee kills Greg after a confrontation, suspecting him of being the murderer (sentence 11).\n     4. The group's dynamics escalate, with suspicions cast on Bee, leading to her being cast out into the hurricane (sentence 16).\n     5. The truth about the \"murders\" is revealed, showing there was no actual murderer, and the group's fears and actions were misguided (sentences 30-31).\n\n2. **Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes:**\n   - **Event 1 (Arrival at the Mansion):** Bee is in a relatively stable state, attending a party with her girlfriend Sophie. Her condition is neutral, with no immediate conflicts or dangers.\n   - **Event 2 (Discovery of David's Body):** Bee's state changes to one of panic and fear as the group discovers a dead body, and they are trapped without power or phone reception. Her condition worsens due to the danger and uncertainty.\n   - **Event 3 (Killing Greg):** Bee's action of killing Greg is a desperate attempt to protect herself and others from a perceived threat. Her state is one of heightened anxiety and possibly guilt, but she sees it as necessary for survival. Her condition could be seen as temporarily stabilizing because she believes she has eliminated the threat.\n   - **Event 4 (Being Cast Out):** Bee's state deteriorates significantly as she is cast out by the group she trusted, leaving her alone and vulnerable in a dangerous situation (the hurricane). Her condition worsens both physically and emotionally.\n   - **Event 5 (Revelation of the Truth):** Upon learning the truth that there was no murderer and that the deaths were accidental or due to the group's own actions, Bee's state could be seen as a mix of relief and possibly shame or regret over her actions. However, the overall trajectory from the start of the story to this point shows a significant decline in her condition from a state of relative safety and trust to one of isolation, violence, and mistrust.\n\n3. **Classify the Story Arc Type:**\n   - The story arc type can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the story. Starting from a neutral or positive state, Bee's condition worsens significantly as the story progresses, marked by increased danger, mistrust, and eventual isolation. Even the final revelation, while providing some closure, does not restore Bee's initial state of safety and trust. This pattern of starting in a relatively better state and ending in a worse state aligns with the **Riches to Rags** story arc type.\n\n4. **Determined Story Arc Type:**\n   Riches to Rags"

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist in the story is Dr. Lily Miller, a committed and compassionate psychiatrist. Five major events in the story can be identified as follows:\n\n1. **Introduction to Dr. Miller's New Role**: Dr. Miller begins working at the Broadview Health Center, marking the start of her new professional journey.\n2. **Introduction to Emma Harper's Case**: Dr. Miller meets Emma Harper, a trauma victim struggling with grief and fear after her mentor's suicide, which becomes a pivotal case for Dr. Miller.\n3. **Investigation of Supernatural Events**: Dr. Miller investigates the strange, supernatural events Emma describes, initially skeptical but eventually experiencing similar occurrences herself.\n4. **Confrontation with the Supernatural Entity**: Dr. Miller and Emma confront the malevolent supernatural entity, leading to a deep emotional and psychological confrontation for both.\n5. **Resolution and Recovery**: After facing their deepest fears and the entity, both women emerge with a newfound resolve, beginning their paths towards recovery and personal growth.\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Introduction to Dr. Miller's New Role)**: Dr. Miller is in a positive state, having overcome hardships in her field and starting a new chapter in her career. She is confident and committed to her work.\n- **Event 2 (Introduction to Emma Harper's Case)**: Dr. Miller's state becomes more empathetic and professionally challenged as she takes on Emma's complex case, showing her compassionate side but also her skepticism towards supernatural claims.\n- **Event 3 (Investigation of Supernatural Events)**: Dr. Miller's state shifts from skepticism to bewilderment and concern as she experiences strange events herself, challenging her professional beliefs and personal understanding of reality.\n- **Event 4 (Confrontation with the Supernatural Entity)**: Dr. Miller faces her deepest fears, and her state becomes one of vulnerability and fear. However, through this confrontation, she also finds a deeper connection with Emma and a resolve to face the unknown.\n- **Event 5 (Resolution and Recovery)**: Dr. Miller emerges in a state of resilience and growth, having faced her fears and the supernatural entity. She is more open to the metaphysical aspects of her patients' experiences and is committed to a more inclusive approach to psychiatric treatment.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc of Dr. Miller can be classified based on how her condition changes throughout the narrative. Initially, she is in a positive and confident state. As she delves deeper into Emma's case and experiences supernatural events, her state worsens, marked by fear, bewilderment, and vulnerability. However, after confronting the entity and her fears, she emerges in a better state than before, showing resilience, a broader professional perspective, and personal growth.\n\nThis pattern follows the **Man in a Hole** story arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (in this case, facing supernatural events and deep personal fears) but finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning. Dr. Miller's journey is one of professional and personal growth, where she faces challenges, hits a low point, but ultimately rises above her initial state, armed with new insights and a stronger resolve.\n\n### 4.

Vesemir saves a noble child from a leshen and discovers it was controlled (sentences 1-2).\n2. Vesemir is arrested for killing two knights in a bar fight (sentence 7).\n3. Vesemir and Tetra find Kitsu, and after a series of events, Vesemir decides to confront Deglan about the creation of monsters (sentences 11-15).\n4. Vesemir confronts Tetra, who has captured the mages and is holding them hostage, leading to a fierce battle (sentences 23-25).\n5. Vesemir mortally wounds Illyana, kills the mages, and later takes the witcher recruits under his wing (sentences 27-33).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: Vesemir is in a position of power and skill, able to save a child from a dangerous creature. His state is positive, with a sense of accomplishment.\n- **Event 2**: Vesemir's state worsens as he is arrested, indicating a loss of freedom and potentially a threat to his life or reputation.\n- **Event 3**: Vesemir's condition improves slightly as he gains more information about the controlled leshen and decides to take action against those responsible for creating monsters. He is proactive and seeking justice.\n- **Event 4**: Vesemir's state becomes more complicated and dire. He is engaged in a fierce battle, and despite his skills, he faces significant challenges, including illusions that threaten his perception of reality.\n- **Event 5**: Vesemir's condition takes a drastic turn for the worse. He inadvertently harms someone he cares about (Illyana), kills the mages, and faces the reality of his actions and the future of witchers. However, he also takes on a new responsibility (caring for the recruits), which could be seen as a step towards redemption or a new beginning.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the changes in Vesemir's state throughout the story, we can see that he faces significant downturns (arrest, battle with Tetra, harming Illyana) but also moments of resolution or new beginnings (deciding to confront Deglan, taking the recruits under his wing). The story does not follow a simple linear improvement or decline. Instead, Vesemir falls into dilemmas (arrest, moral crisis about the creation of monsters, the battle with Tetra) and finds ways out, but not without scars or significant losses. This pattern, where the protagonist faces challenges, overcomes them, but then faces another set of challenges, suggests a specific story arc type.\n\nThe initial decline into a dilemma (arrest), followed by actions that lead to more complications (battle, moral crisis), and then a final turn that involves both loss (Illyana's death, killing the mages) and a new beginning (taking care of the recruits), indicates that Vesemir's story is one of facing and overcoming challenges, but with significant personal costs.\n\n### 4.

narratives.\n3) Jane quickly grows a strong following of passionate viewers ranging from every corner of the world, drawn in by her trademark smile, her thoughtful authenticity, and her avant-garde utilization of real-time comments and fan-instigated song suggestions, which she ingeniously incorporates into her evolving compositions.\n4) However, an ominous unseen entity with malevolent intentions latches onto her progressively popular webcast.\n5) Unbeknownst to Jane and her growing audience, this malevolent force uses her vibrant music stream as a bridge from the otherworldly to our reality, nesting within the limitless labyrinth of the Internet.\n6) Soon enough, as Jane's fanbase swells and her online persona becomes a musical sensation, she starts receiving odd comments during her audience-interaction live-chat sessions.\n7) These peculiar messages, disguised as intricate riddles and perplexing puzzles, begin to shape her performances in unforeseen ways.\n8) Among these mysterious messages often comes from an eerie user named 'Diabolic12', a user whose cryptic influence starts steering her exuberant melodies to take on a darker, more ominous tone.\n9) Jane, immersed in her artistic process, is none the wiser to the subtle manipulation of her music.\n10) Simultaneously, the fans who downloaded Jane's chillingly transformed compositions begin to experience hair-raising incidents.\n11) Screens spontaneously flicker, phones crash without explanation, and several even feel an unseen chilling touch against their skin, turning their comfortable living spaces into a house of haunts.\n12) As the unsettling incidents grow more frequent, Jane herself becomes a target.\n13) She begins to question her sanity as she experiences terrifying hallucinations involving menacing figures and hushed shadowy whispers, driving a wedge into her previously joyous creative process.\n14) Driven by the eerie happenings surrounding her music and urged by her innate curiosity, Jane embarks on a tireless investigation into this bizarre phenomenon.\n15) She dedicates long, nocturnal hours in the dimly lit local library, unearthing dusty old folklore that points towards something unnerving.\n16) Jane comes across an ancient legend about a banished demon by the name of Zephyros, yearning to return to the mortal realm, following millennium-long banishment.\n17) The chill down her spine deepens as she realizes that her music webcast seems to be the digital bridge Zephyros exploited to infiltrate into the human world.\n18) Every piano riff that Jane tenderly develops, and every lyric she pours her heart into, unknowingly serves as an eerie chant in this digital era, further bolstering Zephyros's power in the earthly realm.\n19) The revelation forces Jane to make a difficult decision: to abandon her passion or continue, risking her followers.\n20) It takes days of agonizing deliberation for Jane to arrive at a decision.\n21) Despite her profound sadness at the prospect of discontinuing her webcast, she resolves to confront the situation head-on.\n22) Damning the risks, she uses her platform to alert her audience about the looming threat of Zephyros.\n23) Her dedicated viewers, realizing the severity of the situation, begin getting creative.\n24) They combine their collective wisdom, pool resources, and strategize on ways to combat Zephyros.\n25) Zephyros cruelly morphs Jane\u2019s inspiring melodies into abhorrent soundscapes that reverberate like tortured wails from damned souls, using distortions, screams, and excessive reverb to corrupt her music.\n26) Yet, Jane and her viewers remain resolute, united in their determination.\n27) They resolve to use Zephyros\u2019 own influence against it by integrating the demon's haunting incantations into their original musical compositions.\n28) Their aim is to dilute its power by distorting the very incantations the demon relies on, in the hope of sending it back where it belongs.\n29) As the noble struggle intensifies, Jane's platform becomes the battleground for an unprecedented confrontation of sound and will, as they pit their unity and resolve against the horrifying might of Zephyrosism.\n30) The viewers attempt to counterbalance the gruesome melodies of Zephyros with a powerful composition of their own \u2013 a beautiful sonic tapestry imbued with courage, hope, and an unyielding determination to reclaim control over their lives from the encroaching demon.\n31) The collective composition, filled with sheer survival instinct and a defiant spirit, eventually dwindles the malevolent influence of Zephyros, creating an impenetrable force-field against the demon\u2019s intrusion.\n32) Defeated and trapped in its digital prison once more, Zephyros is unable to harness Jane's melodic compositions for its benefit any longer.\n33) A visibly depleted but unbowed Jane re-emerges on her platform, reassuring her viewers that despite the harrowing ordeal, her spirit remains unbroken.\n34) Jane earnestly pledges to continue her exploration of music, promising an added focus on supernatural safety rules to safeguard her

Icarus suits designed for combat and space environments, and a Q-bomb.\n20) The team plans to travel to the Ellora colony via quantum jump, where Alliance forces have shot down an alien ship.\n21) The team intends to recover the downed ship and analyze the cosmic radiation to locate the alien's home planet, then destroy it with the Q-bomb.\n22) The team arrives at incorrect coordinates in orbit of planet Ellora, in the middle of a battle between Alliance and alien spacefleets, and is forced to conduct an  orbital drop through the space debris.\n23) Ryle, Goss, Ford, and Dash go missing during the drop, and the remainder of the team comes under enemy fire almost immediately after landing, with Bleck being critically wounded.\n24) Elloran survivors rescue the team and, after verifying the team is free of alien infection (infected persons cannot talk), the survivors reveal the aliens have invaded the planet and the area is swarming with alien troops and infected humans.\n25) The survivors offer to treat Bleck at their outpost's medbay, and Ardene goes with them.\n26) Meanwhile, Braxton, accompanied by sniper Sol Cantos, proceeds to the downed alien ship.\n27) While analyzing the ship's radiation, Braxton's Icarus suit reports Ford as alive.\n28) He and Sol Cantos recover Ford, who experiences several visions of the aliens and Goss while concussed, and the three reach the Alliance outpost.\n29) At the outpost, Ardene views video log recordings that reveal the aliens are a hive mind that parasitically procreates by infecting victims, who then fall under the control of the hive mind.\n30) Braxton gives the coordinates of the alien's home planet to Ardene, who reports the tachyon interference generated by the aliens means they cannot travel to the coordinates without first getting into orbit.\n31) Meanwhile, Ford consoles then mercy kills the mortally wounded Bleck.\n32) Dash is revealed to have survived and made his way to the outpost.\n33) Ardene discovers the aliens have built a stabilized quantum space gate near Ellora that will allow the alien armada, currently in the Sigea galaxy, to invade the Milky Way in force.\n34) The survivors plan to collapse the gateway with the Q-bomb by firing it via the outpost's orbital cannon.\n35) While prepping the orbital cannon, Ardene receives a signal from Ryle, who has survived in orbit, albeit with his Icarus suit damaged and unfit for  reentry.\n36) He volunteers to position himself on the gateway and trigger his suit's self-destruct to close the gate after the Q-bomb passes through.\n37) The aliens converge on the outpost and speak through an infected Goss, mocking Ford, preaching the superiority of \"the Sigea\", and offering the chance for humankind's assimilation or death.\n38) After Dash replies with a simple \"no,\" the Sigea begin their attack while Goss boards a Sigea ship.\n39) Ford latches onto the ship and later confronts the infected Goss as she prepares to cross via the completed space gate.\n40) With the orbital gun charged, Ardene loads the Q-bomb into a missile and fires it at the gate.\n41) Goss intercepts the Q-bomb missile in a stasis field, blows Ford into space, and crosses to join the assembled Sigea fleet, inadvertently releasing the bomb from the stasis field in the process.\n42) Ryle positions himself on the space gate and, unable to trigger his suit's self-destruct, instead provides a target reference for the orbital gun.\n43) Ardene, with Braxton's reluctant blessing, fires the gun on Ryle's position, killing him and destroying the gate.\n44) The Q-bomb detonates on the other side of the collapsing gateway, the resulting black hole destroying the Sigea's fleet and home star system.\n45) Braxton, stricken with grief over his uncle's death, kills the Sigea's field commander on Ellora.\n46) Back on Earth, seven days after first contact, Braxton, Ardene, Sol Cantos, Dash, and Ford morosely celebrate in a bar as the Alliance Senate proudly declares that the remaining Sigea have unconditionally surrendered.\n47) Ford takes a shot, sadly reminisces about Goss, and then abruptly leaves the bar.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is General James Ford. Here are 5 major events in the story:\n\n1. **Event 1**: Ford is dishonorably discharged from the Alliance military after dropping a quantum bomb on the rebel colony of Zafdie, earning him the sobriquet \"the Blood General\" (sentence 6).\n2. **Event 2**: Ford is brought back into service by General Eron Ryle with the promise of reinstatement and restoration of his military pension, offering him a chance to redeem himself (sentence 12).\n3. **Event 3**: The strike team, including Ford, launches a counterstrike against the aliens, marking a significant point in Ford's journey towards redemption and confrontation with the alien threat (sentence 17).\n4. **Event 4**: Ford confronts the infected Goss, who is now under the control of the alien hive mind, leading to a critical moment where Ford must make a choice that will impact the outcome of the story (sentence 39).\n5. **Event 5**: The story concludes with the destruction of the Sigea fleet and home star system, and Ford, though having saved humanity, is left to mourn the loss of Goss and reflect on his past actions (sentence 47).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: Ford is at a low point, having been dishonorably discharged and nicknamed \"the Blood General,\" indicating a loss of respect and prestige.\n- **Event 2**: Ford's state improves as he is given an opportunity to redeem himself by being reinstated and having his pension restored, offering a chance to regain his honor.\n- **Event 3**: Ford is actively engaged in a mission to counter the alien threat, which suggests he is in a state of action and purpose, potentially rising from his previous low point.\n- **Event 4**: Ford faces a significant personal dilemma as he confronts the infected Goss, indicating a downturn in his emotional state due to the conflict and loss he faces.\n- **Event 5**: Ford ends the story in a reflective state, having contributed to the salvation of humanity but at a personal cost, including the loss of Goss and the weight of his past actions.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the analysis, Ford's story arc can be seen as starting from a low point (dishonorable discharge), moving to a potential redemption (reinstatement and counterstrike mission), facing a deep personal loss and challenge (confronting infected Goss), and ending in a bittersweet state of salvation for humanity but personal sorrow. This pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist faces significant downturns and upturns, characteristic of a \"Double Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist experiences two cycles of dilemma and recovery. However, upon closer examination, Ford's journey more closely aligns with a pattern of downfall, potential redemption, further personal loss, and a final state that, while better for humanity, is not unequivocally better for the protagonist personally, which could suggest elements of other story arcs like \"Icarus\" or \"Man in a Hole.\" Yet, the specific pattern of facing a dilemma, recovering, facing another dilemma, and then achieving a form of redemption or resolution aligns most closely with the \"Double Man in a Hole\" arc when considering the broader context of Ford's personal and professional redemption journey amidst the alien threat.\n\n### 4.

on Neptune\u2019s frosty surface, they were bewildered by the surprisingly inhabitable conditions, courtesy of the advanced alien tech that regulated the environment.\n34) As John and his team traversed the mesmerizing alien landscape, they made a fascinating discovery: the woman from John's dreams, Eris, was not an illusion but a tangible entity\u2014a breathtaking human-alien hybrid who was far less alien than they had anticipated.\n35) Eris, living in self-imposed exile to escape the clutches of power-hungry corporations on Earth, took refuge on Neptune.\n36) She substantiated every dream that John had seen, bringing the phantom to reality.\n37) She explained the lethal potential of alien technology in the hands of unscrupulous humans, painting a grim picture of a dystopian future.\n38) Eris also had dangerous news for John and his team\u2014a corporate fleet, hell-bent on exploiting her and her secrets, was hot on their trail, determined to claim Neptune as its own.\n39) United against the common enemy, John and Eris, along with his friends, cadged together a concrete plan to outwit the incoming pillagers.\n40) Marshaling the overwhelming potential of alien technology, they also relied heavily on their shared resolve, and strategic manoeuvres, as they steeled themselves for the impending battle.\n41) As predicted, the corporate fleet launched their

advanced to appear as magic, John and his friends made a pact\u2014they\u2019d keep this tech a secret from humanity\u2019s unrelenting grasp, relinquishing any possibility of turning a profit.\n47) Life irrevocably transformed, John Smith\u2014who was once a mere construction worker\u2014now stood as a guardian of the cosmic order, dwelling on a planet where no human had set foot before.\n48)

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is John Smith, a dedicated construction worker. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Discovery of the Ancient Artifact**: John discovers an ancient artifact while working on the construction site (sentence 6).\n2. **Unlocking the Artifact's Secret**: John unlocks the artifact, revealing a holographic projection of the woman from his dreams (sentence 10).\n3. **Decision to Journey to Neptune**: John decides to embark on a journey to Neptune, driven by his dreams and the secrets of the artifact (sentence 16).\n4. **Battle Against the Corporate Fleet**: John and his team face off against a corporate fleet that seeks to exploit the alien technology on Neptune (sentence 41).\n5. **Victory and New Role**: John and his team emerge victorious, and John takes on a new role as a guardian of the cosmic order, staying on Neptune with Eris (sentence 47).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Discovery of the Artifact)**: John's state changes from a mundane routine to one of astonishment and curiosity. His discovery sets him on a path of intrigue and adventure, improving his state from mere routine to one of purpose.\n- **Event 2 (Unlocking the Artifact's Secret)**: John's state shifts from curiosity to being confounded and intrigued by the surreal turn of events. This marks a significant point where his reality and dreams start to intertwine, further engaging him in the mystery and slightly elevating his state of mind due to the excitement and fear of the unknown.\n- **Event 3 (Decision to Journey to Neptune)**: John resolves to undertake a daring journey, indicating a transition from a state of confusion and curiosity to one of determination and adventure. This decision significantly improves his state, as he moves from a passive recipient of dreams to an active seeker of truth and adventure.\n- **Event 4 (Battle Against the Corporate Fleet)**: John faces a drastic challenge, shifting his state from one of adventure and discovery to danger and adversity. This event marks a low point in John's journey, where his state worsens due to the threat of defeat and the danger posed by the corporate fleet.\n- **Event 5 (Victory and New Role)**: After emerging victorious, John's state improves dramatically. He transitions from being a construction worker to becoming a guardian of the cosmic order, marking a significant improvement in his condition. He finds a new purpose, a new home, and a new sense of fulfillment, elevating his state to a much higher level than at the beginning of the story.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc can be classified based on how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the narrative. Initially, John is in a mundane situation (construction worker), then he faces a series of challenges and mysteries (discovery of the artifact, unlocking its secrets, journey to Neptune), followed by a significant adversity (battle against the corporate fleet), and finally, he emerges into a much improved state (victory and becoming a guardian of the cosmic order).\n\nGiven these transitions, John's story follows a pattern where he faces challenges, falls into dilemmas (e.g., the battle against the corporate fleet), but ultimately finds a way out and ends in a better state than where he began. This pattern is characteristic of the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist faces a problem, struggles, and then overcomes it to achieve a better condition. However, the story also involves a second cycle of dilemma and recovery (facing the corporate fleet and then defeating them), which could suggest elements of a \"Double Man in a Hole\" story arc. Yet, the primary narrative thread focuses on John's overall journey from a mundane life to one of cosmic significance, which aligns more closely with the \"Man in a Hole\" arc due to the singular, overarching narrative of downfall and recovery.\n\n### 4.

Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc of William Duncan can be classified based on the pattern of his condition throughout the story. Initially, William is in a high state, enjoying a peaceful life with his family. The death of his daughter sets off a chain of events that leads to a significant downfall (the death of his wife and his own near-death experience), followed by a recovery phase where he trains and prepares for revenge. Ultimately, he faces another significant downfall with his death, despite achieving his goal of revenge.\n\nThis pattern of starting high, falling, recovering, and then facing another significant downfall aligns with the **Oedipus** story arc type. The Oedipus arc is characterized by a protagonist who starts in a position of power or happiness, suffers a reversal of fortune, recovers or adjusts to their new circumstances, but ultimately suffers another, often final, downfall.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Jake Patterson. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Jake's realization and decision to reconnect with his past and possibly rekindle his relationship with Rebecca** (sentence 5).\n2. **The chance encounter with Rebecca at 'The Roasted Bean'** (sentence 9), which rekindles dormant emotions and shared memories.\n3. **Jake's discovery of Richard's illicit activities and his decision to reveal this to Rebecca** (sentences 18-20), marking a significant point where Jake's actions are driven by a desire to protect Rebecca.\n4. **The violent confrontation and revelation of Richard's true nature to Rebecca** (sentences 26-29), which is a climax where Jake's efforts to save Rebecca from a potentially harmful relationship come to a head.\n5. **The final resolution where Rebecca acknowledges Jake's efforts, and they reunite amidst the chaos** (sentences 35-40), marking the end of Jake's journey from a state of restlessness and longing to one of reunion and hope.\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1 (Jake's decision to reconnect with his past):** Jake is in a state of internal restlessness, grappling with turning fifty and still nurturing feelings for his ex-wife. His decision marks a shift from passive longing to active pursuit of reconnection.\n- **Event 2 (Chance encounter at 'The Roasted Bean'):** Jake's state improves as he rekindles emotions and memories with Rebecca, indicating a potential for positive change in his life.\n- **Event 3 (Discovery of Richard's illicit activities):** Jake's state becomes one of anxiety and determination. He is driven by a desire to protect Rebecca, which complicates his life but also gives him a sense of purpose.\n- **Event 4 (Violent confrontation and revelation):** Jake faces physical harm and emotional distress but remains resolute in his mission to save Rebecca. This event marks a low point in his physical state but a high point in his determination and moral courage.\n- **Event 5 (Final resolution and reunion):** Jake's state improves significantly as he and Rebecca reunite. Despite the physical and emotional turmoil he has faced, he ends up in a better emotional state than at the beginning of the story, having successfully protected Rebecca and rekindled their relationship.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the progression of Jake's state throughout the story, it's clear that he starts in a disadvantaged situation (emotionally restless, longing for his past) and ends in a much better one (reunited with Rebecca, having found a new purpose and overcome significant challenges). The story arc is characterized by Jake falling into a dilemma (discovering Richard's true nature and deciding to act), finding a way out (confronting Richard and revealing the truth to Rebecca), and ending up in a better state than where he started. This pattern suggests a \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, as Jake faces a significant problem, works through it, and emerges in a superior state.\n\nHowever, considering the specific events and the overall trajectory of Jake's journey, from a state of longing and restlessness to one of action, danger, and ultimately reunion and hope, the story more closely aligns with the **Rags to Riches** arc. Jake's condition improves from the first turning point to the last, as he moves from a place of personal stagnation and heartache to one of resolution, bravery, and renewed love.\n\n### 4.

Description of Protagonist's State at Each Event\n- **Event 1 (Meeting Walter Lambert):** Hubie is in a vulnerable state, being bullied and taken advantage of by the townspeople. This event introduces a new element of mystery and potential danger into his life.\n- **Event 2 (Corn Maze):** Hubie's state worsens as he faces fear and confusion in the corn maze, further emphasizing his vulnerability and gullibility.\n- **Event 3 (Discovery about the Dog):** This event marks a point where Hubie begins to uncover truths and misunderstandings, potentially starting to regain control and understanding of his situation.

Classification of Story Arc Type\nThe story arc of Hubie Dubois can be classified based on the pattern of his condition throughout the narrative. Initially, Hubie is in a disadvantaged and vulnerable position, facing bullying and disrespect from the community. As the story progresses, he faces additional challenges and dangers, such as the mysterious events and his involvement in the corn maze, which further complicate his situation. However, through his actions and the revelations about his mother and the true feelings of the townspeople, Hubie's condition begins to improve. He gains respect, resolves the mysteries, and ultimately achieves a higher status in the community, becoming the Mayor and earning the respect and admiration of those who once belittled him.\n\nThis pattern, where the protagonist starts in a low state, faces complications and challenges, and then rises to a better state through resolution and recognition, is characteristic of the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc. The \"Man in a Hole\" arc involves a protagonist who falls into a dilemma and then finds a way out, ending up better than at the beginning. Hubie's journey from being a bullied and dim-witted delicatessen employee to becoming a respected and authoritative figure in Salem, through facing and overcoming various challenges, aligns with this narrative pattern.\n\n### 4.

The Greenes' arrival at El Paradiso and their initial experience at the Coconut Palm Resort (sentences 1-4).\n2. The ritualistic murder at the El Paradiso Samba Carnival (sentence 5).\n3. John's discovery of old fables about a haunting curse and his subsequent terrifying nightmares (sentences 9-11).\n4. The escalation of fear and terror as tourists disappear and all modes of escape are stopped (sentences 15-16).\n5. John's decision to perform a ritual to lift the island's curse during the 'Endless Shore Festival' and its successful completion (sentences 20-28).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **Initial Arrival**: John is in a state of relaxation and seeking serenity, having left behind the bustling life of New York. His condition is positive, looking forward to a peaceful retreat with his wife.\n2. **Ritualistic Murder**: This event introduces a significant downturn in John's state. He is shocked and disturbed by what he witnesses, marking the beginning of his descent into fear and unease.\n3. **Discovery of the Curse**: John's condition worsens as he delves deeper into the mystery of the curse. His nightmares and the blurring of reality and his manuscript indicate a growing sense of dread and inner turmoil.\n4. **Escalation of Fear**: With the disappearance of tourists and the impossibility of leaving the island, John's fear escalates to terror. His state is one of heightened anxiety and desperation, feeling trapped and helpless.\n5. **Performing the Ritual**: Despite the fear, John finds the courage to perform the ritual, which ultimately leads to the lifting of the curse and a sense of relief. His condition improves significantly as the terror and dread are replaced by tranquility, albeit with a lasting impact from the experiences.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the narrative. Initially, John is in a positive state, seeking relaxation. However, his condition deteriorates significantly with the ritualistic murder, his discovery of the curse, and the escalation of fear. This downturn represents the \"fall into a hole.\" Subsequently, John's decision to perform the ritual and its successful completion mark a turning point where his condition begins to improve, culminating in a state of relief and a form of resolution, albeit with lasting scars.\n\nThis pattern of falling into a dilemma (the terrifying events on the island) and then finding a way out (performing the ritual to lift the curse) aligns with a specific story arc type.\n\n### 4.

Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: Palmer is in a disadvantaged situation, having just been released from prison. His condition is low due to his criminal past and the challenges of reintegrating into society.\n- **Event 2**: Palmer's condition becomes more complicated as he takes on the responsibility of caring for Sam. While this adds a layer of complexity to his life, it also presents an opportunity for growth and redemption.\n- **Event 3**: Palmer's condition improves significantly as he forms connections with Sam and Maggie. He begins to rebuild his life, finding purpose in his relationships and his work.\n- **Event 4**: Palmer's condition worsens temporarily as he faces legal consequences for his actions to protect Sam. Despite his good intentions, he finds himself in trouble with the law again, which could potentially undermine his progress.\n- **Event 5**: Palmer's condition improves dramatically as he is given custody of Sam. This outcome not only solidifies his role as a guardian and caregiver but also symbolizes his redemption and acceptance by society.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story follows a pattern where the protagonist starts in a disadvantaged situation, faces challenges and setbacks, but ultimately achieves a higher state of being. This is characterized by Palmer's initial release from prison, his growth through his relationships with Sam and Maggie, a temporary setback due to legal issues, and finally, his attainment of custody and a newfound sense of purpose and belonging.\n\nThe story arc that best fits this pattern is the **Cinderella** arc, where the protagonist rises, faces a setback, and ultimately achieves a higher state. This is evident in Palmer's journey from a life of crime and incarceration to becoming a responsible guardian and member of his community, overcoming significant obstacles along the way.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\nThe protagonist of the story can be considered as Erika, given that the narrative extensively explores her actions, thoughts, and the impact she has on other characters, particularly Alex. However, the story's focus shifts significantly towards Alex as it progresses, making him a co-protagonist or even the main protagonist in the latter half. For the purpose of this analysis, we'll consider Alex as the protagonist because the story's resolution and the character's emotional journey are more closely tied to him.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. **Erika's Escape**: Erika murders Hugo and then manipulates Alex into giving her a ride, marking the beginning of her escape plan (sentences 6-10).\n2. **Forming a Bond**: Erika and Alex form a unique bond over art, leading to Alex inviting her to stay with him (sentences 12-14).\n3. **Discovery of Erika's Past**: Alex discovers Erika's true nature and her involvement in the murder at the asylum, marking a significant turn in their relationship (sentence 18).\n4. **Psychological Warfare**: Alex uses his therapy skills to manage Erika's behavior, engaging in a form of psychological warfare to protect his family (sentences 23-26).\n5. **The Final Confrontation**: Alex outsmarts Erika, traps her in her own psyche, and arranges for her apprehension by the police (sentences 27-31).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n- **At Event 1 (Erika's Escape)**: Alex is oblivious to the danger Erika poses. His state is one of kindness and professionalism, unaware of the threat that has just entered his life.\n- **At Event 2 (Forming a Bond)**: Alex's state improves as he forms a connection with Erika, seeing her as a resilient individual who could benefit from his help. He is hopeful and empathetic.\n- **At Event 3 (Discovery of Erika's Past)**: Alex's state worsens significantly as he discovers the truth about Erika. He moves from a state of trust and empathy to one of fear and dread for his family's safety.\n- **At Event 4 (Psychological Warfare)**: Alex's state is one of strategic engagement, using his skills to counter Erika's manipulations. He is proactive and determined to protect his family, indicating a level of control and agency.\n- **At Event 5 (The Final Confrontation)**: Alex's state improves as he successfully outsmarts Erika and ensures her capture. However, the experience leaves him with a lingering sense of unease and a tainted trust in humanity.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\nGiven the progression of Alex's state throughout the story, we can observe that he initially is in a positive state (oblivious but safe), then improves further (forming a bond), followed by a significant downturn (discovery of Erika's past), then regains control (psychological warfare), and finally ends in a better state than his lowest point but not without scars (the final confrontation). This pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist faces a dilemma, finds a way out, and ends better than at the beginning, but with a lasting impact from the experience.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To classify the story arc type, let's first identify the protagonist and 5 major events in the story.\n\nThe protagonist in the story is Edmond Murray, the absent father who is called to the site of his son Ethan's disappearance.\n\nHere are 5 major events in the story:\n\n1. Edmond is called to the site of his son Ethan's disappearance (sentence 1).\n2. Edmond discovers videos of Ethan on Frank's phone, leading him to investigate further (sentence 8).\n3. Edmond finds and interrogates William O'Connor, learning about the kidnapping ring and his son's location (sentences 12-14).\n4. Edmond rescues his son Ethan from the kidnappers at the hilltop lodge (sentences 18-22).\n5. Edmond is arrested by Inspector Roy for his part in the illegal activities of his company, despite his heroic actions (sentences 26-29).\n\nNow, let's analyze the protagonist's state at each event and how it changed relative to the previous events:\n\nAt event 1, Edmond is in a state of distress and concern for his missing son. His state is low due to his feelings of guilt and anxiety.\n\nAt event 2, Edmond's state becomes more determined and focused on finding his son. He has discovered a lead and is taking action to investigate, which improves his state slightly.\n\nAt event 3, Edmond's state becomes more intense and desperate as he learns about the kidnapping ring and his son's location. He is willing to take risks and use aggressive means to rescue his son, which shows a sense of urgency and desperation.\n\nAt event 4, Edmond's state improves significantly as he rescues his son and reunites with him. This is a peak moment in the story, and Edmond's state is high due to his relief and joy.\n\nAt event 5, Edmond's state falls again as he is arrested and faces consequences for his actions. Despite his heroic rescue of his son, he is still held accountable for his past mistakes, which lowers his state.\n\nBased on this analysis, the story arc type can be classified as follows:\n\nThe protagonist's condition starts low (distress and concern), improves slightly (determined and focused), becomes more intense and desperate (willing to take risks), peaks (rescues his son), and then falls again (arrested and facing consequences). This pattern matches the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc type, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (his son's disappearance) and finds a way out (rescuing his son), but ultimately ends up in a lower state than expected (arrested).\n\nMan in Hole"

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Louis Wain. Here are 5 major events in the story:\n\n1. Louis becomes the primary breadwinner for his family after his father's death and starts working as an illustrator.\n2. Louis marries Emily Richardson, despite the societal scandal it causes, and they start a new life together.\n3. Emily is diagnosed with breast cancer, which significantly affects Louis's life and work.\n4. Louis's mental health deteriorates following the death of his loved ones, including Emily, and he experiences financial difficulties.\n5. Louis is eventually committed to a mental hospital but is later transferred to a better facility with the help of his admirers and supporters.\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: Louis's state is one of responsibility and struggle as he takes on the role of breadwinner for his family. His condition is challenging but hopeful for a better future.\n- **Event 2**: Louis's state improves as he finds love and marries Emily. This event marks a high point in his emotional and personal life, despite the societal challenges they face.\n- **Event 3**: With Emily's diagnosis, Louis's state begins to deteriorate. He faces the impending loss of his loved one and the grief that follows, which starts to affect his work and mental health.\n- **Event 4**: After the death of Emily and other significant losses, Louis's state worsens dramatically. He experiences mental breakdowns, financial crises, and the loss of his family members, leading to his commitment to a mental hospital.\n- **Event 5**: Despite the previous downturn, Louis's state slightly improves as he is transferred to a better facility. This shows a recovery or a stabilization in his condition, thanks to the support of his admirers and the presence of a cat companion.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nTo classify the story arc type, let's analyze Louis's condition throughout the story:\n- The story starts with Louis facing challenges but in a position of hope and responsibility.\n- It rises with his marriage to Emily, marking a peak in his happiness and stability.\n- Then, it falls with Emily's illness and death, followed by a series of tragic events that lead to Louis's downfall, including financial struggles and mental health issues.\n- Finally, there's a slight recovery as Louis is moved to a better facility, showing a small improvement in his condition.\n\nGiven this pattern, the story does not follow a straightforward **Rags to Riches** or **Riches to Rags** arc, as Louis's condition fluctuates significantly. It also doesn't fit the **Man in a Hole** or **Double Man in a Hole** perfectly, as Louis's recovery at the end is not to a state better than his initial peak. The **Icarus** story arc is closer, as Louis rises to success (with his marriage and initial career success) but then faces a drastic downfall. However, the **Cinderella** story arc, which involves a rise, a setback, and ultimately achieving a higher state, doesn't perfectly match Louis's journey either, as his final state is not higher than his peak but rather a slight improvement from his lowest point.\n\nThe closest match seems to be the **Icarus** story arc due to the significant rise and fall in Louis's condition, but with the understanding that his story has elements of tragedy and recovery that are not perfectly encapsulated by any single story arc type. The initial classification as **Cinderella** does not fully align with the detailed analysis of Louis's condition throughout the story.\n\n### 4. Determined Story Arc Type\n\nIcarus"

what's more, Kevin's wife has already been \"shifted\" twice, without anything being noticed.\n11) Kevin is skeptical and asks the Benefactor to prove it, suggesting that Tina, a waitress in the caf\u00e9, be \"shifted\" for demonstration.\n12) The Benefactor does just that, then informing Kevin that he's intentionally \"shifted\" Tina to a universe in which she's never existed, and that such \"shifts\" are cruel because of deranging effects on the \"shifted\" person's psyche.\n13) Realizing that this action will drive Tina insane, Kevin begins to say under his breath a prayer to God for help.\n14) Enraged, the Benefactor snarls that he'll never leave Kevin alone and that he's better than God and certainly better than Kevin, before vanishing abruptly and leaving Kevin trapped in that dystopian universe.\n15) Horrified at what he's just done, Kevin apologizes to Tina's family and leaves.\n16) Five years later, Kevin is still in the totalitarian reality, living under an assumed name because of \"illicit prayer\" at the caf\u00e9 by \"Kevin who refused\".\n17) In that universe, most of the planet was destroyed by constant war and anthropogenic activity with deleterious environmental impact.\n18) At first the \"shifters\" operated in secret, moving between alternate universes and exiling anybody regarded as \"problematic\" by the regime, with the help of small wrist-worn shifting devices called \"deviators\"; with millions of people vanished without trace, order could be restored in remaining areas of human habitation.\n19) After the Benefactor arrived and the surviving world leaders ceded control to him, he made the world over in his image.\n20) Majority of people live in squalid, poverty-stricken cities ruled with an iron fist by the Benefactor's secret police.\n21) Kevin attempts to write down from memory as many passages from the Bible and as closely to original text as he can remember and distributes the typed pages through his friend Gabriel, despite Scripture being illegal.\n22) Kevin also shares the story of Job with his neighbor, Rajit, and his family.\n23) Kevin's only solace is going to a movie theater owned by Russo, which plays a live feed from the viewer's direct doppelgangers in alternate realities.\n24) In the theater, Kevin sees several versions of Molly, one of which is a single mother working as a nurse and still wearing a necklace that Kevin bought for her before their estrangement and which only the \"original\" Molly wore until she was replaced by the Benefactor with her doppelganger.\n25) Kevin plans to obtain a deviator from one of the \"shifters\", but their identities are secret.\n26) Kevin hears an announcement on TV that the Benefactor is returning to that reality for the first time in five years, and acquires an illegal firearm from Gabriel, intending to force the Benefactor to take him back to his previous life in the old reality.\n27) However, the plan fails and the police open fire during a raid on Rajit's adjacent apartment, wounding Rajit and knocking Gabriel unconscious.\n28) Kevin sees a deviator on Gabriel's wrist and realizes that Gabriel has been one of the Benefactor's secret \"shifters\" all along, shifting himself to another reality with Gabriel's deviator.\n29) Kevin shifts through several universes, in one of them coming across Tina, who is unhinged and in a psychiatric ward.\n30) The next shift with the deviator brings him back to his bullet-riddled apartment in the dystopian reality.\n31) He runs to Russo's cinema and together they are able to identify the other universe from which the view of Molly with the necklace originates; after feeding the coordinates into the deviator, Kevin is shifted to that universe.\n32) Molly in that universe is upset by conversation with Kevin, suggesting that they both should move on and reminding him that break-up of their marriage was initiated by him - but Kevin also feels that their relationship could be still revived.\n33) Suddenly the Benefactor returns Kevin to the totalitarian universe, shifts Tina to Russo's cinema and tells Kevin that he should choose between restoring Tina to her family (never to see Molly again) and staying with Molly forever after accepting the Benefactor's offer to become his shifter.\n34) Kevin decides to give Tina her life back, and immediately after that he's suddenly shifted to another reality.\n35) In that reality, Molly is the nurse and single mother he saw previously and doesn't recognise him.\n36) He strikes up a conversation similar to their first meeting, and the two get married once again.\n37) Kevin states that although this is not his universe, it is his home.\n38) He's seen playing with his newborn son and his adopted daughter, proving that he was given double what he lost.\n39) In a post-credits scene, Kristoffer Polaha (who portrays Kevin in the film) thanks all viewers for watching the film and briefly mentions the inspirations for its screenplay and behind its production.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better (e.g., 0\u21921\u21922\u21924\u219210)\n- Riches to Rags: Protagonist starts high and ends lower (e.g., 10\u21929\u21928\u21926\u21920)\n- Man in a Hole: Protagonist falls into trouble but recovers (e.g., 6\u21922\u21921\u21924\u219210)\n- Icarus: Protagonist rises then falls dramatically (e.g., 2\u21924\u21929\u21925\u21921)\n- Double Man in a Hole: Two cycles of fall and recovery (e.g., 6\u21922\u21927\u21924\u219210)\n- Cinderella: Rise, setback, ultimate triumph (e.g., 1\u21927\u21924\u21921\u219210)\n- Oedipus: Start high, fall, recover, final fall (e.g., 10\u21924\u21927\u21929\u21921)",

these overwhelmingly vivid dreams, Jordan's parents seek the expertise of Dr. Rose, a revered therapist renowned for her humanistic approach interlaced with an uncompromising staunchness.\n6) Dr. Rose, through her empathetic counselling, proposes a unique idea to Jordan- maintaining a journal of his nightmares.\n7) A striking black leather-bound book then becomes the deposit box for Jordan's

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Jordan Miller, an extraordinary nine-year-old child. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Jordan's Nightmare and Introduction to Dr. Rose**: Jordan has terrifying dreams, and his parents seek help from Dr. Rose, a therapist (Sentences 1-5).\n2. **Jordan Starts Keeping a Journal of His Nightmares**: Dr. Rose suggests Jordan keep a journal of his nightmares, which becomes a significant part of his journey (Sentences 6-7).\n3. **The Journal's Accidental Publication and Discovery by Max Wilde**: Jordan's journal is accidentally misplaced, found, and mistakenly believed to be a masterpiece, leading to its popularity and catching the attention of Hollywood director Max Wilde (Sentences 9-12).\n4. **Jordan Agrees to Turn His Journal into a Movie**: Despite initial resistance, Jordan agrees to work with Max to turn his nightmares into a comedy film (Sentences 13-15).\n5. **The Movie's Success and Jordan's Transformation**: The movie is made and becomes a success, helping Jordan to face and overcome his fears through laughter and creative expression (Sentences 16-24).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Jordan's Nightmare and Introduction to Dr. Rose)**: Jordan is in a state of fear and distress due to his nightmares. His condition is poor, affected by the terrifying dreams.\n- **Event 2 (Jordan Starts Keeping a Journal of His Nightmares)**: Jordan's state begins to show signs of improvement as he starts to confront his nightmares through the journal. His condition is slightly better as he begins to address his fears.\n- **Event 3 (The Journal's Accidental Publication and Discovery by Max Wilde)**: Jordan's journal becoming a sensation and catching Max Wilde's attention marks a significant turn. Jordan's state improves further as his unique situation brings him unexpected attention and potential opportunities.\n- **Event 4 (Jordan Agrees to Turn His Journal into a Movie)**: By agreeing to the movie, Jordan takes a proactive step towards facing his fears. His state improves as he begins to see the comedic potential in his nightmares and decides to act on it.\n- **Event 5 (The Movie's Success and Jordan's Transformation)**: The success of the movie and Jordan's role in it lead to a significant improvement in his state. He is no longer controlled by his fears but instead uses them as material for comedy, showing a substantial improvement in his condition.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc can be classified based on the trajectory of the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. Jordan starts in a disadvantaged state (fear and distress due to nightmares), faces challenges, and through his journey, ends up in a much better state (facing and overcoming his fears, finding success and laughter). This pattern, where the protagonist's condition improves from the beginning to the end, aligning with overcoming initial disadvantages to achieve a better state, fits the **Rags to Riches** story arc type. The key elements here are the transformation from a state of fear to one of confidence and success, and the use of his nightmares as a catalyst for this change, which is a hallmark of the **Rags to Riches** narrative.\n\n### 4.

Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Annie flies to London):** Annie is escaping the challenges of her life in Los Angeles, such as pandemic restrictions and homelessness, indicating a desire for change and possibly a low point in her life due to these frustrations.\n- **Event 2 (Annie steals Stretch\u2019s car):** Annie's actions lead to more conflict and chaos, indicating a further decline in her situation as she engages in risky behavior and potentially damages her friendship with Stretch.\n- **Event 3 (Discovery about Angela):** Annie and Stretch are in a precarious and mysterious situation, indicating a state of uncertainty and danger. This event marks a point where Annie's condition could be seen as hitting a low due to the escalating strange and threatening circumstances.\n- **Event 4 (Angela kills Stretch):** This event represents a significant low point for Annie, as she loses her friend and is left alone to face the dangers that Angela poses. This is emotionally and situationally a deep hole for Annie.\n- **Event 5 (Annie kills Angela and the creature):** Annie emerges victorious but not without scars, both physically and emotionally. She has navigated through a series of dangerous and bizarre events, coming out on top but forever changed by her experiences.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the progression of Annie's condition throughout the story, it starts with her seeking escape from her frustrations, then plummeting into a series of dangerous and bizarre events, hitting a low point with the death of her friend, and finally emerging victorious but changed. This pattern suggests that Annie falls into a dilemma (flying to London and getting entangled in the mysterious events surrounding Angela) and finds a way out, ending in a better state than when she was at her lowest (having overcome the supernatural threats). However, the story's complexity, with its multiple layers of conflict and recovery, suggests a more nuanced arc than a simple \"Man in a Hole\" might imply. Yet, the core element of falling into a hole (the series of escalating dangers and mysteries) and then finding a way out (overcoming Angela and the creature) aligns with this arc type.\n\n### 4.

The protagonist of the story is Vivo, the kinkajou who plays music with Andr\u00e9s Hern\u00e1ndez.\n2. Here are 5 major events in the story:\n   - Event 1: Andr\u00e9s dies, and Vivo decides to deliver Andr\u00e9s' song to Marta (sentence 6).\n   - Event 2: Vivo and Gabi's attempt to reach Marta's show is thwarted, and they end up in the Everglades, getting separated and losing the song (sentence 11).\n   - Event 3: Vivo and Gabi recreate the song, and Vivo decides to continue his journey to deliver it to Marta (sentence 17).\n   - Event 4: Vivo successfully delivers the song to Marta, who is touched by it and decides to go on stage (sentence 21).\n   - Event 5: Vivo decides to stay in Florida with Gabi and Rosa and even performs with Marta and Gabi (sentence 27).\n\nNow, let's describe the protagonist's state at each event and how it changed relative to the previous events:\n\n- At Event 1, Vivo is ashamed and motivated to make things right by delivering the song to Marta. His state is one of determination and guilt.\n- At Event 2, Vivo's state worsens as he faces obstacles (getting separated from Gabi and losing the song), making his situation more difficult and hopeless.\n- At Event 3, Vivo's state improves as he finds a way to recreate the song with Gabi's help, regaining hope and determination.\n- At Event 4, Vivo's state improves further as he successfully delivers the song to Marta, achieving his goal and finding a sense of fulfillment.\n- At Event 5, Vivo's state is at its best, having not only delivered the song but also finding a new family and performing with them, indicating a happy and stable condition.\n\nBased on these events, we can see that Vivo starts in a low state (ashamed and guilty), falls into a deeper dilemma (facing obstacles and losing the song), but then finds a way out and ends in a better state (delivering the song, finding a new family, and performing with them).

        "output": "To classify the story arc type, let's first identify the protagonist and major events in the story.\n\n1. **Identify the protagonist and major events:**\n   - The protagonist can be considered as Art, given that his emotional journey and decisions play a pivotal role in the narrative's progression and climax.\n   - Five major events in the story are:\n     1. Art begins to speculate that the government and the scientists are wrong about the impending doom (Event 11).\n     2. Art discovers a dead family on the side of the road, leading to his realization of the reality of their situation (Event 15).\n     3. Art decides not to take the pill and runs away, only to be found by Simon (Events 14 and 17).\n     4. The group decides it's time to take their pills, and Art passes out, with his parents giving the pills to his siblings (Events 20 and 21).\n     5. Art wakes up after everyone else has taken the pills and died (Event 31).\n\n2. **Describe the protagonist's state and how it changed:**\n   - **Event 11:** Art is distressed and begins to question the authority's narrative, showing a shift from resignation to curiosity and hope. His state changes from passive acceptance to active questioning.\n   - **Event 15:** After discovering the dead family, Art is shocked and screams, indicating a realization of the dire situation. His state changes from hopeful questioning to fearful realization.\n   - **Events 14 and 17:** Art's decision not to take the pill and his subsequent running away show determination and a will to live. However, being found and returned home indicates a loss of control over his fate. His state changes from determined to helpless.\n   - **Events 20 and 21:** Art passes out, and his parents give the pills to his siblings, indicating a point of no return for those around him. Art's state appears hopeless as he is unaware of the impending death of his family.\n   - **Event 31:** Art wakes up to find everyone dead, but he himself is alive. This event shows a significant change in Art's state from apparent hopelessness to survival, albeit in a tragic context.\n\n3. **Classify the story arc type:**\n   - Given Art's journey, the story starts with Art in a relatively stable, albeit grim, situation (hosting a Christmas dinner amidst an impending catastrophe). As the story progresses, Art's condition worsens emotionally and psychologically as he faces the reality of death and the loss of his family ( Events 11 to 21). However, the final event (31) shows Art alive, which could suggest a turn for the better. \n   - Despite this final twist, considering the overall narrative and focusing on the emotional and situational journey of Art, the story can be seen as following a **Riches to Rags** arc. Art starts in a high-status position (relatively safe with his family) and ends in a significantly lower state (alive but alone and surrounded by death). The final turning point, while offering a glimmer of hope, does not negate the overall downward trajectory of Art's condition throughout the majority of the story.\n\n4. **Determined story arc type:**\nRiches to Rags"

This is followed by another challenge (the final confrontation) but ultimately ends in a better state (escaping with Mary, planning a future together). This pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist faces challenges, experiences a significant improvement, and then, despite further obstacles, achieves a higher state than where they began.\n\nThe story follows a pattern where the protagonist rises from a low point, faces a setback, and then ultimately achieves a higher state, which aligns with the **Cinderella** story arc type.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Pippa, a young woman who moves into her first apartment with her boyfriend Thomas. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Pippa and Thomas move into their new apartment and start watching their neighbors** (sentences 1-4).\n2. **Pippa and Thomas spy on their neighbors and learn about \"Brent's\" infidelity** (sentences 5-12).\n3. **Pippa discovers Julia's situation and tries to warn her, leading to a confrontation with Thomas** (sentences 13-19).\n4. **Julia's apparent death and Thomas's subsequent breakup with Pippa and his own death** (sentences 20-28).\n5. **The revelation that Seb and Julia are alive, and Pippa's revenge against them** (sentences 29-41).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1:** Pippa is in a positive state, having just moved into her first apartment with her boyfriend. She's curious and playful, giving her neighbors pseudo names.\n- **Event 2:** Pippa's state becomes more voyeuristic and slightly guilty as she and Thomas spy on their neighbors. However, she's still in a relatively good place in her relationship and life.\n- **Event 3:** Pippa's condition starts to deteriorate as she becomes more invested in Julia's life and tries to warn her about Seb's infidelity. This leads to tension in her relationship with Thomas, causing her emotional state to worsen.\n- **Event 4:** Pippa's state hits a low point with Julia's apparent death and Thomas's death. She's heartbroken and alone, feeling responsible for the tragic events.\n- **Event 5:** Pippa's condition improves slightly as she seeks revenge against Seb and Julia, but it's a dark and vengeful improvement. She's no longer the carefree or even morally grounded person she was at the beginning.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven Pippa's journey, her condition starts in a relatively high state (happy in her new apartment and relationship), faces significant setbacks and worsens (emotional distress, loss of relationship, and guilt over deaths), and while she does take action and exact revenge, her final state is morally and emotionally darker than her initial state. This pattern doesn't fit the \"Rags to Riches\" or \"Man in a Hole\" arcs because Pippa doesn't end in a better state than she started. It doesn't fit \"Icarus\" perfectly because Pippa's rise and fall aren't as straightforward, and she doesn't exactly \"rise\" in the traditional sense. It also doesn't fit \"Cinderella\" because, after her setback, Pippa doesn't achieve a higher state of being; instead, she becomes consumed by vengeance. The closest match is \"Riches to Rags\" because Pippa starts in a good place (emotionally and relationally) and ends in a significantly lower state (emotionally darker, alone, and morally compromised), even though the story takes a complex path to get there.\n\n### 4.

charismatic charm had a way of smoothing things over, securing him another drink on his account.\n4) At the end of yet another long night, Reece ambled out of the pub, having paid his substantial bill with his most recent winning scratch-off ticket.\n5) He then made his way to Marlboro's only 24-hour convenience store, Lloyd's Groceries.\n6) With trembling hands and a foggy breath, he mustered

brushed-off and rebutted Jenny's earnest pleas and serious concerns.\n22) Feeling defeated yet absolutely determined, Jenny reached out to Marlboro Rehab Center, exposing Reece's escalating issues

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Reece, a 35-year-old vagabond known for causing trouble in the small town of Marlboro, New Hampshire. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. Reece wins a significant amount of money from a lottery ticket (sentence 8).\n2. Reece pledges to change his life and become a responsible citizen after winning the lottery (sentence 11).\n3. Despite his pledge, Reece spirals into a life of hedonistic parties and substance abuse, squandering his wealth (sentences 13-16).\n4. Reece hits rock bottom, realizing the extent of his downfall and the loss of his friend Jenny's trust, and decides to seek help from the Marlboro Rehab Center (sentences 28-34).\n5. Reece successfully undergoes rehabilitation, reforms his life, and becomes a positive influence in the community (sentences 44-60).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Winning the Lottery):** Reece's state changes from being a vagabond living on the edge to suddenly having a significant amount of money. This newfound wealth brings him temporary joy and attention from the town.\n- **Event 2 (Pledging to Change):** Reece appears to be on the path to positive change, expressing a desire to abandon his old life and become a responsible citizen. His state seems to be improving as he garners hope and support from the locals.\n- **Event 3 (Spiraling into Addiction):** Reece's state deteriorates significantly as he falls deeper into substance abuse and reckless spending. Despite initial hopes for change, he succumbs to his old habits, leading to a decline in his relationships and overall well-being.\n- **Event 4 (Hitting Rock Bottom):** Reece reaches a low point, realizing the damage he has done to himself and his relationships. This event marks a turning point where he acknowledges his need for help and begins to seek a way out of his destructive lifestyle.\n- **Event 5 (Rehabilitation and Reform):** Reece's state improves dramatically as he undergoes rehabilitation, mends his relationships, and starts contributing positively to the community. He transforms from a troublemaker to a redeemed figure, symbolizing resilience and recovery.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc can be classified based on the pattern of the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. Reece starts in a disadvantaged situation (as a vagabond), experiences a rise (winning the lottery and pledging to change), faces a significant setback (spiraling into addiction), and then undergoes a recovery (seeking help and reforming his life). This pattern resembles the **Cinderella** story arc, where the protagonist rises, faces a setback, and ultimately achieves a higher state. Reece's journey from a life of trouble and addiction to one of redemption and community service exemplifies this arc.\n\n### 4. Determined Story Arc Type\n\nCinderella"

This pattern of rising, falling, and then achieving a higher state than before is characteristic of the Cinderella story arc.

supposedly, it was an enchanted prison for a powerful and ill-tempered witch, captured by a wise shaman centuries before their time.\n30) Soon, whispers of Jane's encounter with the paranormal spread like wildfire around Silverint, their amicable townsfolk now treating her more skeptically, as if she were a magnet for unnatural energies.\n31) Jane found herself being treated differently.\n32) The food from the local diner had a strange, sour taste, and even Dash resorted to snarling every time she made an attempt to pet him.\n33) Distressed, lonely, and feeling the isolation more than ever, Jane yet refused to give in to the malevolent entity.\n34) Drawing upon her final reserves of energy, she fortified her resolve and swore to reclaim her peaceful life from the manifestations.\n35) Bearing her ordeal, Jane turned to Father Patrick, the town's well-respected priest and spiritual guide.\n36) She also sought help from Octavia, an elderly woman revered for her knowledge of historical lore and antiques, hoping to find a solution.\n37) They revealed to Jane an ancient local legend, a popular but largely untested folk tale about a mythical vault hidden deep within the heart of Thorne island.\n38) Folklore suggested that this vault contained magic powerful enough to reverse Jane\u2019s chilling encounters.\n39) Octavia, glancing ominously at Jane, shared a puzzling clue: the vault would only make itself visible during the rare event of a lunar eclipse.\n40) This, she divulged, was to occur just the following night.\n41) High on nerves, Jane began her intense preparations as per the detailed rituals from Silverint's lore.\n42) She read ancient texts, memorized enchantments and mentally rehearsed the sacred rites necessary to combat the unseen enemy.\n43) Sensing her resolve, the vindictive spirit took a terrifying step.\n44) The peaceful tranquility of Jane's house ruptured into flames.\n45) Once a serene solace, her home now seemed to be a war zone, engulfed in an inferno and trying to consume her.\n46) Jane barely managed to escape the inferno, risked her life and dashed out into the darkness, only escaping with minor burns and a relentless spirit, fueled further by the desperate countermeasures the entity took.\n47) On the night of the lunar eclipse, armed with nothing but her courage and a series of chants, Jane set off into the eerie wilderness of Thorne, braving supernatural obstacles set by the vengeful spirit, towards the unseen vault.\n48) As she confronted the ghastly apparition, adrenaline coursing wildly through her veins, the only weapon she found she possessed was her  unwavering courage, resolute determination, and the disappearance of her previous reservations.\n49) With her relentless will, she fought and triumphed, successfully trapping the malevolent entity, trapping it back into the confines of the lustrous brass locket.\n50) She lodged the now dormant locket into an ancient stone niche within the concealed vault and sealed it shut, just as the last fragment of the lunar eclipse dissipated into the ebony sky.\n51) Life gradually began to find its way back to Jane.\n52) The town's folks' previously wary outlooks softened, Dash\u2019s playful spirit resurfaced, and Jane began to see a glimmer of her old, tranquil life.\n53) Jane\u2019s lifestyle morphed significantly in the succeeding days.\n54) She began to frequent Silverint more often and started to build forts of friendship with the once estranged townsfolk.\n55) Jane had gone from the reclusive 'island woman' to becoming a symbol of resilience, a beacon of courage and a testament to determination for the entire town.\n56) In conclusion, Jane is seen calmly watching the sun rise from her fixed up cabin porch, the sense of fulfillment and empowerment radiating from her was infectious, giving the audience a final sense of satisfaction after her considerable journey.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better (e.g., 0\u21921\u21922\u21924\u219210)\n- Riches to Rags: Protagonist starts high and ends lower (e.g., 10\u21929\u21928\u21926\u21920)\n- Man in a Hole: Protagonist falls into trouble but recovers (e.g., 6\u21922\u21921\u21924\u219210)\n- Icarus: Protagonist rises then falls dramatically (e.g., 2\u21924\u21929\u21925\u21921)\n- Double Man in a Hole: Two cycles of fall and recovery (e.g., 6\u21922\u21927\u21924\u219210)\n- Cinderella: Rise, setback, ultimate triumph (e.g., 1\u21927\u21924\u21921\u219210)\n- Oedipus: Start high, fall, recover, final fall (e.g., 10\u21924\u21927\u21929\u21921)",
        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Jane, a quiet individual living in peaceful solitude on the island of Thorne with her Golden Retriever, Dash. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. **Jane's Decision to Sail into Silverint**: Jane realizes she needs to stock up on supplies and decides to sail into Silverint, marking a significant decision that sets the story in motion (sentence 5).\n2. **Receiving the Brass Locket**: Jane meets Grisly, who gives her a brass locket that he claims holds unusual power, introducing an element of mystery and potential danger into her life (sentence 10).\n3. **The Locket's Dark Influence**: Jane discovers the locket's dark influence as her life on the island transforms drastically, with inexplicable events and paranormal activity disrupting her peace (sentence 15).\n4. **Confronting the Truth and Finding a Solution**: Jane learns the truth about the locket from Grisly and seeks help from Father Patrick and Octavia, leading her to the myth of a vault that can reverse the locket's effects (sentences 29-40).\n5. **Defeating the Malevolent Entity**: Jane faces her fears and, with courage and determination, traps the malevolent entity back into the locket and seals it in the vault, marking her victory over the darkness that had invaded her life (sentences 47-50).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1 (Sailing into Silverint)**: Jane's state is one of necessity and slight reluctance to engage with the outside world. She is still in control of her life and peaceful existence.\n- **Event 2 (Receiving the Locket)**: Jane's state becomes one of curiosity and slight unease, but she is still hopeful and intrigued by the possibility of the locket's power.\n- **Event 3 (The Locket's Influence)**: Jane's state deteriorates significantly as she experiences fear, confusion, and a loss of control over her life due to the paranormal events.\n- **Event 4 (Seeking a Solution)**: Jane's state is one of determination and desperation.

She has successfully overcome the darkness and is on the path to rebuilding her life, even improving it by engaging more with the community.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. Initially, Jane is in a peaceful state, then she falls into a dilemma with the introduction of the locket and its dark influence, and finally, she finds a way out of this hole by defeating the malevolent entity and reclaiming her life. This pattern of falling into a problem and then rising above it to an even better state than before matches the **Man in a Hole** story arc. The key characteristics of this arc are present: the protagonist starts in a good place, faces a significant challenge (the hole), and then emerges from this challenge in an even better state than before, having grown or changed positively.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To classify the story arc type, let's first identify the protagonist and major events in the story.\n\nThe story doesn't have a single protagonist but rather a group of protagonists, the five distinct teenagers: Jake, Matt, Grace, Violet, and Emily. For the purpose of analysis, we'll consider the group as a collective protagonist.\n\nHere are 5 major events in the story:\n\n1. **Introduction to the characters and their individual struggles** (sentences 3-8): The group is introduced, showcasing their unique characteristics and challenges.\n2. **Receiving the cryptic notes and being brought together in detention** (sentences 9-11): The group is forced to interact, leading to initial hostility and animosity.\n3. **Sharing personal stories and forming a bond** (sentences 12-17): As they spend time together, they open up about their personal battles, leading to a deeper understanding and connection among them.\n4. **Planning and executing the escape from detention** (sentences 18-20): The group works together to outsmart their principal and escape the detention classroom.\n5. **Solidifying their friendship and newfound confidence** (sentences 23-28): After their adventure, they form a stronger bond, promising respect and support to each other, and confidently challenge the norms and expectations at their school.\n\nNow, let's describe the protagonist's state and how it changed relative to the previous events:\n\n* At event 1, the group is introduced, and each member is struggling with their own issues, feeling isolated or pressured in their own way. Their state is one of individual struggle and disconnection.\n* At event 2, the group is brought together, but their initial interactions are tense and hostile. Their state has become one of collective discomfort and conflict.\n* At event 3, as they share their personal stories, they begin to form a connection and understand each other's struggles. Their state shifts to one of empathy and budding friendship.\n* At event 4, the group works together to achieve a common goal (escaping detention), showcasing their growing trust and cooperation. Their state has improved, as they're now working together and relying on each other.\n* At event 5, the group has solidified their friendship and is now confident in challenging the norms and expectations at their school. Their state has improved significantly, as they've formed a strong bond and are now empowered to make changes.\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, we can see that the group starts in a state of individual struggle and disconnection, falls into a state of collective conflict, but then recovers and improves as they form a connection and work together. Ultimately, they achieve a higher state of confidence, empathy, and friendship.\n\nThe story arc type is **Man in a Hole**, as the protagonist (the group) falls into a dilemma (detention and initial conflict) but finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning (forming a strong bond and gaining confidence).\n\nMan in a Hole"

Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Joe is at the peak of his success, admired and celebrated.\n- **Event 2**: Joe's state has significantly worsened; he is lonely, depressed, and his career is in shambles. This is a low point compared to his past success.\n- **Event 3**: The appearance of Joey introduces conflict and self-doubt, but also sparks a desire for change. Joe's state is still low but with a glimmer of potential for improvement.\n- **Event 4**: Joe starts to take action towards redeeming his career and personal life, showing improvement from his previous state of despair.\n- **Event 5**: Joe achieves a form of success and personal growth, accepting his past and present selves. His state has improved significantly from the low point in Event 2, and he has found a new path to success and happiness.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. Initially, Joe is in a state of success, which drastically declines. However, with the catalyst of Joey's appearance, Joe begins a journey of self-discovery and improvement. This journey involves facing his past mistakes, finding a new path in his career, and ultimately achieving success again, albeit in a different form.\n\nThe key elements here are the fall from success to a low point (Event 2) and the subsequent rise to a new form of success (Event 5). The presence of a significant low point (depression and career failure) followed by a rise to a better state (acceptance, personal growth, and new success) aligns with specific story arc types.\n\n### 4.

Identification of Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonists of the story are Jack and Leo, but for the purpose of analyzing the story arc, we can consider their collective journey as the focus, with an emphasis on Jack's character development due to his more pronounced emotional and situational changes throughout the story.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. Jack receives an invitation to Leo's 30th birthday party and decides to attend (Event 4).\n2. Jack and Leo's reconnection at the birthday party is initially strained (Event 6).\n3. Jack reveals his unresolved fear of flights to Leo, which sparks a heart-to-heart conversation (Event 9).\n4. The duo successfully retrieves the stolen Basquiat painting after a chase (Event 11).\n5. The film concludes with Jack and Leo's birthday celebration, where they make peace and promise to stay connected (Event 13).\n\n### 2. Description of Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1 (Invitation to Leo's party):** Jack's state is one of nostalgia and possibly disconnection from his past, indicated by his decision to attend the party. This event sets him on a path of reconnection with his past and with Leo.\n- **Event 2 (Strained reconnection):** Jack's state is tense and uncertain, as he and Leo struggle to reconnect. This represents a low point in their relationship and in Jack's emotional state, as he is forced to confront the distance and differences that have developed between them.\n- **Event 3 (Revelation of fear):** Jack's state is vulnerable, as he opens up about his fear of flights and its connection to Leo. This marks a turning point where Jack begins to confront and resolve past issues, leading to a potential for growth and healing.\n- **Event 4 (Successful retrieval of the painting):** Jack's state is one of triumph and camaraderie, as he and Leo work together to achieve a common goal. This event symbolizes their renewed friendship and Jack's ability to face challenges alongside Leo.\n- **Event 5 (Celebration and making peace):** Jack's state is one of resolution, peace, and renewed connection with Leo. This final state is better than his initial state, as he has reconciled with his past, resolved a longstanding issue with Leo, and reaffirmed their friendship.\n\n### 3. Classification of Story Arc Type\n\nThe story follows a pattern where the protagonist (Jack, and collectively Jack and Leo) faces a dilemma or a low point (their strained reconnection and Jack's unresolved fear) but ultimately finds a way out and ends in a better state than at the beginning (their renewed friendship and personal growth). This pattern matches the **Man in a Hole** story arc type, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma and then finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning. The key elements that support this classification are the initial disconnection and tension between Jack and Leo, the revelation and resolution of Jack's fear, and the eventual triumph and peace they achieve together.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Dexter Reed. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. Dexter's house burns down due to his invention failure (sentence 2).\n2. Dexter decides to work at Good Burger again (sentence 11).\n3. Dexter and Ed sign the contract with MegaCorp (sentence 16).\n4. Dexter and Ed discover MegaCorp's true intentions and the consequences of their contract (sentence 17).\n5. Dexter, Ed, and the Good Burger employees successfully stop the launch of Mega Good Burger and MegaCorp is shut down (sentences 29-31).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Dexter's house burns down):** Dexter is at a low point, having lost his home and business due to his invention's failure. This is one of the lowest points in his condition throughout the story.\n  \n- **Event 2 (Dexter decides to work at Good Burger again):** Dexter's condition has slightly improved as he now has a place to stay (with Ed) and a job, providing him with some stability and income. However, he is still far from his goal of becoming a successful entrepreneur.\n\n- **Event 3 (Dexter and Ed sign the contract with MegaCorp):** Dexter's condition seems to improve financially as he considers the potential benefits of the deal for himself and Ed. He believes this could be a step towards financial stability and success.\n\n- **Event 4 (Dexter and Ed discover MegaCorp's true intentions):** Dexter's condition worsens significantly as he realizes his mistake in signing the contract. The employees are to be fired, and Good Burger will lose its original charm. This is a setback for Dexter, both personally and in terms of his relationship with others.\n\n- **Event 5 (Dexter, Ed, and the Good Burger employees stop the launch of Mega Good Burger):** Dexter's condition improves dramatically. Not only does he help save Good Burger, but he also makes amends with his sister and niece. Additionally, Ed and Ed 2 figure out how to make permanent ice, which leads to a significant financial gain for Good Burger, indirectly benefiting Dexter.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the analysis of Dexter's condition throughout the story, it can be observed that he starts at a low point (losing his home and business), then experiences a series of ups and downs. Initially, he faces failure and rejection, which places him in a disadvantaged situation. As the story progresses, he finds some stability and considers opportunities for financial gain, which suggests an improvement in his condition. However, he then faces a significant setback with the discovery of MegaCorp's intentions, which worsens his condition. Finally, he ends the story on a high note, having helped save Good Burger, making amends with his family, and indirectly benefiting from the success of Good Burger.\n\nThe story arc that best fits this pattern is the \"Rags to Riches\" arc because Dexter starts in a disadvantaged situation (losing his home and business due to invention failures) and ends in a much better situation (having saved Good Burger, made amends, and indirectly benefiting from its success). Although he faces setbacks along the way, his overall trajectory from the beginning to the end of the story is one of improvement.\n\n### 4. Determined Story Arc Type\n\nRags to Riches"

        "output": "To classify the story arc of the given narrative, let's follow the instructions step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the protagonist in the story, and identify 5 major events in the story.**\n\nThe protagonists of the story are Rosemary Muldoon and Anthony Reilly, but since the story arc classification is typically applied to a single protagonist's journey, we can consider the narrative to focus primarily on Anthony Reilly's transformation, given the significant character development and change he undergoes.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n- Event 1: Anthony's father, Tony, plans to disinherit him and sell the farm to his nephew Adam because Anthony seems incapable of marrying and continuing the family legacy (sentence 9).\n- Event 2: At Tony's 75th birthday party, Adam arrives and flirts with Rosemary, making Anthony realize his potential loss (sentence 13).\n- Event 3: Tony decides not to sell the farm to Adam, giving Anthony a chance to redeem himself and potentially marry Rosemary (sentence 17).\n- Event 4: After Tony's death, Anthony pushes Rosemary away, suggesting she leave Ireland, which seems like a step backward in his potential relationship with her (sentence 22).\n- Event 5: Anthony finally proposes to Rosemary after she finds the ring he had lost, and he confesses his secret and his love for her (sentence 30).\n\n2. **At each event, describe the protagonist's state and how it changed relative to the previous events.**\n\n- At Event 1, Anthony's state is one of potential loss and isolation. He's about to be disinherited and feels disconnected from his family's future and from Rosemary.\n- By Event 2, Anthony's state becomes more aware of his potential losses, not just the farm but also Rosemary to another man. This realization could motivate him to change.\n- At Event 3, Anthony's state improves slightly as he's given a second chance with the farm and potentially with Rosemary. However, his personal issues remain.\n- During Event 4, Anthony's state regresses as he pushes Rosemary away, indicating he still struggles with his personal demons and is not ready to accept love or connection.\n- By Event 5, Anthony's state has significantly improved. He's able to confront his issues, confess his love, and propose to Rosemary, showing considerable personal growth and a willingness to embrace connection and love.\n\n3. **Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain your reasoning.**\n\nThe story arc of Anthony Reilly can be classified based on how his condition changes throughout the narrative. Initially, Anthony is in a disadvantaged state, facing disinheritance and emotional isolation. However, through various events, he undergoes significant personal growth. He moves from a state of loss and isolation to one of connection and love, ultimately proposing to Rosemary and finding a sense of belonging and purpose.\n\nGiven this trajectory, the story arc fits the **Rags to Riches** pattern. Anthony starts in a poor emotional state, faces challenges, and through his journey, ends up in a much better state, having overcome his personal issues and found love and a sense of direction.\n\n4. **Determined story arc type:**\nRags to Riches"

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\nThe protagonist of the story is Noa, a woman from Portland who becomes embroiled in a horrific situation with a cannibal named Steve (later revealed to be Brendan). Five major events in the story are:\n1. Noa meets Steve at the supermarket and they exchange numbers (sentence 2).\n2. Noa wakes up in captivity, chained to the ground, after being drugged by Steve (sentence 8).\n3. Noa tries to escape but is caught and punished by Steve, who harvests her buttocks (sentence 13).\n4. Noa gains Steve's trust by flirting with him and pretends to enjoy eating human meat, which allows her to plot her escape (sentences 23-24).\n5. Noa and the other captives escape, and after a fight, they kill Brendan and his wife Ann (sentences 36 and 39).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n- **Event 1**: Noa's state is one of hope and potential new beginnings as she meets someone she's interested in, improving her situation from being disillusioned with online dating.\n- **Event 2**: Noa's state drastically worsens as she finds herself in captivity, facing a terrifying and life-threatening situation.\n- **Event 3**: Noa's state continues to worsen as she faces physical harm and the psychological trauma of being held captive and mutilated.\n- **Event 4**: Noa's state begins to improve slightly as she gains the upper hand by manipulating Steve, which gives her a sense of control and hope for escape.\n- **Event 5**: Noa's state improves significantly as she successfully escapes, overcomes her captors, and achieves a form of justice and freedom.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\nThe story arc type can be classified based on how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the story. Initially, Noa is in a state of disillusionment but then descends into a horrific situation (Event 2), which is the lowest point. She then begins to plot her escape, improving her situation slightly (Event 4), and finally achieves freedom and revenge (Event 5), ending in a better state than she began with. This pattern follows the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (being captured and held by a cannibal) and finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning.\n\n### 4.

Debbie and Peter come face-to-face at LAX, leading to a heated argument, a declaration of love, and them kissing passionately (sentence 25).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Debbie's state is one of planning and aspiration for a better career. She is taking steps to improve her situation by pursuing an accounting program in New York.\n- **Event 2**: Debbie's state improves as she meets new people, including a potential love interest (Theo) and gains opportunities (a potential date and a connection in the publishing world). This indicates an upward trend in her social and potentially romantic life.\n- **Event 3**: Although this event directly affects Peter, it indirectly affects Debbie by setting in motion the revelation of Peter's feelings for her. Debbie's state remains relatively unchanged in terms of her awareness but sets the stage for future developments.\n- **Event 4**: Debbie's state shifts significantly as she realizes and acknowledges her feelings for someone else (implied to be Peter). This marks a turning point where her emotional and romantic focus begins to clarify and potentially improve.\n- **Event 5**: Debbie's state culminates in a romantic resolution with Peter, leading to a significant improvement in her emotional and romantic life. She transitions from a state of uncertainty and potential loneliness to one of love and connection.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the analysis, Debbie starts in a situation where she is seeking improvement (pursuing a better career), faces various challenges and realizations (including misunderstandings and the revelation of Peter's feelings), and ultimately achieves a higher state of being (finding love with Peter and improving her career). This pattern resembles the **Cinderella** story arc, where the protagonist rises, faces setbacks, and ultimately achieves a higher state. The key elements here are the initial desire for improvement, the series of events that complicate and potentially set back the protagonist, and the ultimate achievement of a better situation than where she started.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To classify the story arc type, let's break down the story into its key components as per your instructions.\n\n1. **Identify the protagonist and 5 major events:**\n   - The protagonist is Madison, an 18-year-old violin student at Juilliard.\n   - Five major events in the story are:\n     1. Madison feels overwhelmed by her struggles and decides to step out for a walk, leading her to The Blue Note jazz club (sentence 5).\n     2. She meets George, a saxophonist, and is inspired by his raw, passionate melodies (sentence 7).\n     3. Madison confesses her romantic feelings to George, but he defensively deflects her confession due to fear of societal backlash (sentence 15).\n     4. Madison prepares for her final performance at Juilliard, choosing to perform an unprecedented piece that fuses classical music with jazz (sentence 19).\n     5. George joins Madison on stage for a spontaneous jazz-violin duet, and their performance resonates deeply with the audience (sentence 23).\n\n2. **Describe the protagonist's state and how it changed at each event:**\n   - At event 1, Madison is feeling overwhelmed and trapped by her rigid practice regimen, lacking a sense of fulfillment in her music. Her state is one of dissatisfaction and longing for something more.\n   - At event 2, after meeting George and being inspired by his music, Madison's state changes to one of inspiration and hope. She starts to see a different path for her music, one that involves more passion and spontaneity.\n   - At event 3, following George's rejection of her romantic confession, Madison's state shifts to one of hurt and possibly doubt about her feelings and decisions. This rejection adds a personal dimension to her struggle, making her question not just her music, but also her relationships.\n   - At event 4, as Madison prepares for her final performance, her state is one of determination and courage. Despite the personal setback with George, she decides to take a risk with her music, blending classical and jazz in a way that could either succeed greatly or fail.\n   - At event 5, with George joining her on stage and their performance being well-received, Madison's state changes to one of triumph and validation. Not only does she find success in her musical risk-taking, but she also finds a form of redemption and acceptance in her relationship with George.\n\n3. **Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain the reasoning:**\n   - The story starts with Madison in a state of dissatisfaction and longing (a kind of \"hole\" she's in), feeling unfulfilled by her strict musical regimen.\n   - She then experiences a series of ups and downs: finding inspiration, facing rejection, taking a risk, and ultimately finding success and validation.\n   - The key characteristic of Madison's journey is that she falls into a dilemma (her dissatisfaction with her music and later the rejection by George) and then finds a way out, ending in a better state than where she began. This pattern fits the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc type, where the protagonist's condition improves from the first turning point to the last turning point, as they navigate through challenges to reach a higher state of being or success.\n\n4. **Determined story arc type:**\nMan in a Hole"

Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Discovery of the Book)**: George is curious and intrigued by the unusual book. His state is one of mild interest and engagement with his weekly routine.\n- **Event 2 (Decision to Perform the Ritual)**: George's state shifts to one of determination and commitment. He is driven to understand and perform the ritual, indicating a proactive and engaged state.\n- **Event 3 (Challenges and Encounters)**: George faces doubts and challenges, which introduce uncertainty and potential setbacks. His state becomes more complex, with moments of excitement and anticipation mixed with creeping doubts.\n- **Event 4 (Performance of the Ritual)**: With renewed confidence, George successfully performs the ritual, leading to a state of accomplishment and pride. The success of the ritual improves his state significantly.\n- **Event 5 (Aftermath and New Beginnings)**: George's state evolves to one of reflection, satisfaction, and anticipation for new adventures. He is in a better state than at the beginning, having found a new sense of purpose and power.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, it can be observed that George starts in a relatively neutral or mild state of curiosity, faces challenges and doubts (a \"hole\" or downturn), and then recovers and improves significantly after the successful performance of the ritual. This pattern, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (the challenges and doubts associated with preparing for and performing the ritual) and then finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning (with a sense of accomplishment, pride, and new beginnings), aligns with the **Man in a Hole** story arc type.\n\n### 4.

Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain the reasoning\n\nThe story arc of Alice's journey can be classified based on how her condition changes throughout the narrative. Initially, Alice is in a state of solitude and reluctance, which can be considered a low point. As the story progresses, she faces challenges and complications, particularly with the introduction of Frank and the revelation about Vera. However, she also experiences moments of connection, love, and ultimately, a sense of belonging and purpose. The story's progression shows Alice falling into a dilemma (caring for Frank, dealing with her past) but then finding a way out that leads to a better state than where she started. This pattern aligns with a specific story arc type that involves a protagonist facing challenges, hitting a low point, but ultimately ending in a better condition than at the beginning.\n\n### 4.

Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1:** John's state is one of stress and struggle, trying to manage work and childcare. Hiring Alex marks a potential solution to his problems, indicating a hopeful state.\n- **Event 2:** John's state improves significantly as Alex's presence helps in managing the children and reducing his stress, showing a positive change from the initial state.\n- **Event 3:** Discovering Alex's secret night job leads to a state of anger and betrayal, causing John to let Alex go, which is a downturn in his state compared to the previous event.\n- **Event 4:** Without Alex, John's state worsens as he struggles to manage the household and his job, realizing too late the value Alex brought, indicating a further decline.\n- **Event 5:** John's decision to ask Alex to return and his subsequent acceptance marks a significant improvement in his state, as he learns to accept Alex for who he is and values the positive changes he brings to the household, showing an upward trend.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, it can be observed that John starts in a disadvantaged situation (struggling with work and childcare), experiences an improvement (with Alex's help), faces a setback (when he discovers Alex's secret and lets him go), and ultimately achieves a higher state (when he accepts Alex back and learns to appreciate him for who he is). This pattern of rising, facing a setback, and ultimately achieving a higher state aligns with the **Cinderella** story arc type, which involves a protagonist who rises, faces a setback, and ultimately achieves a higher state.\n\n### 4.

he spent countless nights gazing at the cosmic bodies, his anxiety surmounting.\n18) His mental condition balanced on the knife-edge of an abyss.\n19) His loneliness began to transform into a fear of himself, his deteriorating mental state, and his unending hallucinations.\n20) Despite his declining sanity, he plunged in, enticed by the mysteries held within the cluster of sparkling stars.\n21) In a daring move, John disregarded Astro Corp's regulations, sharing his unbelievable findings with Earth.\n22) His communication immediately set off alarms, and Astro Corp hastily arranged for a replacement astronaut to take over the lunar station.\n23) Unfazed by these developments, John undertook a final expedition into the heart of the Elysium Stars.\n24) With an unyielding spirit, he boarded his lunar shuttle, \"Stellar Explorer\", heading towards the unknown buried within the unfathomable cosmic bodies.\n25) However, in the following weeks, the once habituated hum of the Astro Corp outpost fell into a devastating silence.\n26) John's regular communications ceased abruptly, and his whereabouts plunged into unsolvable mystery.\n27) Alarming signals indicating John's puzzling disappearance were released into the cosmos, setting the stage for the arrival of his replacement astronaut.\n28) The mission had suddenly assumed a dire tone, the unknown that lay before the incoming astronaut growing in intensity.\n29) As the search for John escalated, his raw, emotional video logs played, their contents echoing through the empty outpost.\n30) His absence, amplified by the mysteriously vacant quarters he once inhabited, only multiplied the mounting questions about his sudden departure.\n31) After grueling days of lunar search expeditions, the incoming astronaut finally stumbled upon John, lying unconscious near the hypnotizing sphere of Elysium Stars.\n32) Despite the dire circumstances, John was quickly relocated to the outpost and transported back to Earth.\n33) His unconscious state, coupled with periods of fevered mutterings about the Elysium Stars, raised more questions than answers.\n34) Back on Earth, a team of experts studied John, puzzled by his psychologically adrift state.\n35) Despite his physical presence, his mind seemed to still wander among the celestial bodies he left behind.\n36) His constant murmurs about the Elysium Stars set off a worldwide wave of fascination for this mesmerizing constellation.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better (e.g., 0\u21921\u21922\u21924\u219210)\n- Riches to Rags: Protagonist starts high and ends lower (e.g., 10\u21929\u21928\u21926\u21920)\n- Man in a Hole: Protagonist falls into trouble but recovers (e.g., 6\u21922\u21921\u21924\u219210)\n- Icarus: Protagonist rises then falls dramatically (e.g., 2\u21924\u21929\u21925\u21921)\n- Double Man in a Hole: Two cycles of fall and recovery (e.g., 6\u21922\u21927\u21924\u219210)\n- Cinderella: Rise, setback, ultimate triumph (e.g., 1\u21927\u21924\u21921\u219210)\n- Oedipus: Start high, fall, recover, final fall (e.g., 10\u21924\u21927\u21929\u21921)",
        "output": "### TASK 1: Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is John, the isolated astronaut living on the moon's dark side at the Astro Corp outpost.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. **Discovery of the Anomaly and Elysium Stars**: John discovers an unusual energy signature and the Elysium Stars, which sparks his curiosity and sets him on a path of discovery (sentences 8-12).\n2. **Internal Conflict and Choice**: John is torn between his duties and his desire to explore the Elysium Stars, ultimately choosing to delve deeper into the mystery (sentences 13-14).\n3. **Deterioration of Mental State**: As John becomes more obsessed with the Elysium Stars, his mental state begins to deteriorate, marked by vivid dreams, loss of sleep, and increasing anxiety (sentences 15-19).\n4. **Defiance and Expedition**: Despite his declining sanity, John decides to share his findings with Earth and then undertakes a final, daring expedition into the heart of the Elysium Stars, disregarding Astro Corp's regulations (sentences 21-24).\n5. **Rescue and Aftermath**: John is found unconscious near the Elysium Stars, rescued, and returned to Earth, where his psychological state is found to be adrift, still haunted by the celestial bodies he discovered (sentences 31-35).\n\n### TASK 2: Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **Discovery of the Anomaly and Elysium Stars**: John's state changes from monotony and loneliness to curiosity and intrigue. This event marks a turning point where John's condition improves slightly as he finds a new purpose.\n2. **Internal Conflict and Choice**: John's state is one of conflict, but he makes a choice that aligns with his heart's desire, showing a moment of resolve and determination. His condition remains complex, with both positive (engagement with a new discovery) and negative (internal conflict) aspects.\n3. **Deterioration of Mental State**: John's state worsens significantly as his obsession with the Elysium Stars leads to a decline in his mental health, characterized by anxiety, hallucinations, and fear. This marks a low point in his condition.\n4. **Defiance and Expedition**: Despite his poor mental state, John shows courage and determination by deciding to pursue his discovery, regardless of the consequences. This act can be seen as a moment of defiance against his deteriorating condition, but it also leads to a more dangerous and risky situation.\n5. **Rescue and Aftermath**: John's state is one of physical rescue but psychological distress. He is safe but still mentally adrift, indicating that while he has been pulled out of the immediate danger, his overall condition has not significantly improved from its lowest point.\n\n### TASK 3: Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the story. Initially, John is in a state of loneliness and monotony, which can be considered a low point. The discovery of the Elysium Stars improves his condition slightly as it gives him a sense of purpose. However, as the story progresses, his condition worsens due to his obsession, leading to a significant decline in his mental health. This decline is followed by a moment of risk and defiance, and ultimately, he is rescued but left in a psychologically fragile state.\n\nGiven these changes, the story does not follow a simple improvement or decline. Instead, John faces a dilemma (his loneliness and the discovery that leads to obsession), falls into a deeper problem (his deteriorating mental state), and then finds a way out of the immediate danger (being rescued) but not out of his psychological distress. This pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist faces challenges, hits a low point, and then experiences a form of rescue or resolution, but not necessarily a complete recovery to a better state than where he started.\n\n### TASK 4: Determined Story Arc Type\n\nMan in a Hole"

Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Peter's Loss at Sea (Event 4)**: Nemo learns that her father, Peter, was lost at sea.\n2. **Introduction to Slumberland and Flip (Events 9-12)**: Nemo discovers the world of Slumberland, where she meets Flip, a character from her father's stories who is real.\n3. **The Quest for Magical Pearls (Events 13-16)**: Nemo and Flip embark on a journey to find magical wish-granting pearls, navigating through dreams and facing challenges.\n4. **Rescuing Flip and Discovering the Truth (Events 22-24)**: Nemo rescues Flip from imprisonment and reveals to him his true identity as Philip's dream alter ego.\n5. **Using the Wish to Save Flip and Reuniting with Her Father (Events 32-37)**: Nemo uses a wishing pearl to force Flip to wake up, which leads to Philip becoming emboldened in the real world, and she eventually gets to spend time with her father in Slumberland before returning to the real world.\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **At Event 1 (Peter's Loss at Sea)**: Nemo's state is one of devastation and loss. She has just learned that her father is lost at sea, which significantly worsens her condition from a stable life with her father.\n- **At Event 2 (Introduction to Slumberland and Flip)**: Nemo's state begins to show signs of hope and adventure. She discovers a new world and a friend, which slightly improves her condition, offering her a distraction and a new goal.\n- **At Event 3 (The Quest for Magical Pearls)**: Nemo's state is one of determination and risk. She is on a quest, facing challenges, which keeps her condition dynamic but with an upward trend as she finds purpose.\n- **At Event 4 (Rescuing Flip and Discovering the Truth)**: Nemo's state becomes more complex, as she deals with the reality of Flip's identity and his reluctance to wake up. This event presents a setback in her emotional journey, as she faces the harsh truth about her uncle and his connection to Flip.\n- **At Event 5 (Using the Wish to Save Flip and Reuniting with Her Father)**: Nemo's state improves significantly. She successfully uses a wish to save Flip, which in turn transforms her uncle Philip, and she gets to reunite with her father, albeit briefly. This event marks a significant improvement in her condition, as she finds closure, improves her relationship with her uncle, and begins to heal.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the story. Nemo starts in a relatively stable condition, faces a significant downfall with her father's loss, then embarks on a journey of discovery and adventure in Slumberland. She faces setbacks, such as learning the truth about Flip and dealing with the challenges of her quest, but ultimately ends in a better state than where she began. She rescues Flip, transforms her uncle, reunites with her father (even if briefly), and starts to rebuild her life in the real world.\n\nThis pattern of falling into a dilemma (her father's loss and her subsequent struggles), finding a way out through her adventures in Slumberland, and ending in a better state than at the beginning aligns with the **Double Man in a Hole** story arc type, as it involves cycles of dilemma and recovery. However, a closer examination reveals that while Nemo does face two significant challenges (her father's loss and the complexities of Flip's identity and her quest), her overall journey is more accurately described by a pattern of initial loss, followed by a rise through her adventures and discoveries, and ultimately achieving a higher state of being through her bravery and the resolution of her uncle's internal conflict.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe story features a group of friends as protagonists, but for the purpose of analyzing the story arc, we can consider the collective group or focus on key individuals like Sarah and Max, who play significant roles throughout the narrative. Major events in the story include:\n\n1. **Introduction to the Game**: The friends discover and decide to play \"Survival Mode\" (sentences 3-6).\n2. **Initial Gameplay and Strange Occurrences**: They start playing the game, experiencing strange glitches and horrors (sentences 7-10).\n3. **Escalation of Tasks and Horror**: The game's tasks become more dangerous and personal, affecting the friends' mental and physical states (sentences 11-18).\n4. **Desperation and Attempt to Quit**: The friends try to quit the game but find it impossible to escape, leading to a decision to beat the game to survive (sentences 19-23).\n5. **Confronting Fears and the Final Confrontation**: They strategize to beat the game, facing their deepest fears in a psychological battleground (sentences 24-30).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Introduction to the Game)**: The protagonist (collective group) is in a state of boredom and monotony due to quarantine life. The discovery of the game introduces excitement and a desire for escapism.\n- **Event 2 (Initial Gameplay and Strange Occurrences)**: The protagonist's state shifts to one of cautious excitement, with a growing sense of unease due to the strange occurrences in the game.\n- **Event 3 (Escalation of Tasks and Horror)**: The protagonist's state deteriorates as they face increasing danger and horror, leading to fear, anxiety, and a decline in their mental and physical well-being.\n- **Event 4 (Desperation and Attempt to Quit)**: The protagonist reaches a state of desperation, realizing the game's harmful effects and trying to escape, only to find it impossible. This leads to a strategic decision to confront the game head-on.\n- **Event 5 (Confronting Fears and the Final Confrontation)**: The protagonist's state is one of resolve and determination, as they strategically face their fears to survive the game. Despite the trauma, they manage to overcome the game, but not without significant psychological scars.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nAnalyzing the protagonist's condition throughout the story, we see an initial rise in excitement and anticipation (Introduction to the Game), followed by a decline into fear and desperation (Escalation of Tasks and Horror), and then a recovery of sorts as they strategize to overcome the game (Desperation and Attempt to Quit, Confronting Fears and the Final Confrontation). However, the story concludes with the protagonists forever changed, bearing deep psychological scars, and with the ominous hint that their nightmare may not be over (the new update of 'Survival Mode'). This pattern does not fit a simple rise or fall but instead suggests a complex arc where the protagonists face significant challenges, recover to some extent, but ultimately end in a state that, while better than the depths of their desperation, is still markedly worse than their initial state due to the trauma endured.\n\nGiven the complexities and the fact that the protagonists start in a relatively low state (boredom and monotony), face a series of challenges that significantly lower their state (fear, horror, desperation), attempt to recover (strategizing to beat the game), and end in a state that is improved from their lowest point but still marked by trauma and the potential for further horror, the story arc can be seen as reflective of the **Oedipus** type. This classification is based on the pattern of starting high (in terms of safety and normalcy), falling (into horror and desperation), recovering partially (by strategizing to overcome the game), and then facing another significant threat (the new update), which suggests a cycle of descent and partial recovery, followed by the looming potential for another descent.\n\n### 4.

Description of Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Aadi is in a state of poverty and desperation but has a spark of hope and passion for learning. His condition is disadvantaged but hopeful.\n- **Event 2**: Aadi's condition improves as he gains recognition and respect through his participation and success in the trivia contest. He moves from a state of obscurity to one of admiration.\n- **Event 3**: Aadi's condition worsens dramatically as he is accused of cheating and removed from the contest.

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story can be considered as Jack Philips, as the narrative significantly focuses on his growth, challenges, and ultimate triumphs throughout the mission.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. **Introduction to NASA's Command Center**: Jack joins the elite team of \"Orbital Engineers\" with a mix of nerves and excitement (sentence 4).\n2. **The Mission Begins**: The team, including Jack, Richard, and Meg, sets forth on their mission to repair the Hubble Space Telescope aboard the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft (sentence 8).\n3. **Discovery of the Time Bomb**: The team discovers a hidden time bomb within the Hubble Space Telescope, threatening unprecedented devastation (sentence 12).\n4. **Richard's Injury and the Team's Response**: Richard sustains a crippling injury, leaving Meg and Jack to navigate the challenges of disarming the bomb and salvaging satellites (sentence 18).\n5. **Successful Disarmament of the Bomb and Aftermath**: Meg and Jack successfully disarm the bomb, rectify the satellite anomalies, but at the cost of Richard's life (sentences 25-28).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1 (Introduction to NASA's Command Center)**: Jack is nervous and excited, indicating a state of anticipation and slight insecurity about his new role. His condition is one of potential, ready to be developed.\n- **Event 2 (The Mission Begins)**: Jack is determined and ambitious, honing his skills for the mission. His state has transitioned to one of focus and preparation, indicating a positive trajectory in his development as an astronaut.\n- **Event 3 (Discovery of the Time Bomb)**: Fear is introduced, and Jack's state changes to one of alarm and urgency. This marks a downturn in his condition as the situation becomes more dire.\n- **Event 4 (Richard's Injury and the Team's Response)**: Jack faces a significant challenge with Richard's injury, requiring him to step up alongside Meg. His state is one of heightened responsibility and stress, yet he begins to show signs of growth and capability.\n- **Event 5 (Successful Disarmament of the Bomb and Aftermath)**: Despite the tragic loss of Richard, Jack emerges victorious but somber, having undergone a profound metamorphosis. His condition has improved from his initial state, as he has grown into a more capable and seasoned astronaut, ready to carry on Richard's legacy.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc can be classified based on the protagonist's (Jack) condition throughout the narrative. Initially, Jack starts in a state of potential and growth (nervous but ambitious). He faces a significant downturn with the discovery of the time bomb and the subsequent challenges, including Richard's injury. However, he recovers and grows from these challenges, ultimately ending in a better state than where he began, having successfully completed the mission and matured as an astronaut.\n\nThe narrative follows a pattern where the protagonist faces difficulties, overcomes them, and emerges in a better condition than at the start. This does not perfectly align with a single cycle of downfall and recovery (Man in a Hole) but shows elements of facing multiple challenges and growing from them.\n\nGiven the options and the pattern observed, the closest match seems to be a story arc that involves facing challenges, recovering, and ultimately achieving a higher state. However, the provided classification of \"Double Man in a Hole\" suggests a pattern of two cycles of dilemma and recovery, which can be argued as Jack faces his initial fears and the later, more significant challenges following Richard's injury, and emerges stronger each time.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story can be considered as Shiloh, given that the story begins and ends with her, and her transformation and survival are central to the plot. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. The massacre at The Last Exit bar begins, and Les is shot (Event 10).\n2. The group of heroin addicts, led by Gail, takes control of the bar, and it becomes clear there's another, more violent group outside (Event 11-14).\n3. Will's true nature as a monster is revealed, and he begins killing the patrons (Event 32-35).\n4. Shiloh manages to kill the monster Will and then is attacked by Lori, leading to her transformation into a monster (Event 41-46).\n5. Shiloh, now in monster form, breaks through the barricades and kills the remaining members of the outside group (Event 47).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Massacre begins):** Shiloh is in a state of shock and fear, witnessing the violence and Les' death. Her condition is low due to the trauma and danger.\n- **Event 2 (Addicts take control):** Shiloh's state slightly improves as she is alive and among other survivors, but she is still in grave danger and under the control of violent addicts. Her condition remains precarious.\n- **Event 3 (Will's transformation):** Shiloh's state worsens significantly as she witnesses the terrifying transformation of Will into a monster and the subsequent slaughter of the patrons. She is in immediate danger and experiences intense fear.\n- **Event 4 (Shiloh kills Will and transforms):** Initially, Shiloh's condition improves as she manages to kill the monster Will, which could be seen as a recovery from her previous state of fear and helplessness. However, she then gets attacked and, in response, transforms into a monster herself. This transformation can be seen as a downfall because she loses her human identity and control.\n- **Event 5 (Shiloh in monster form kills the outside group):** Shiloh's state, in terms of power and control, could be seen as improved because she is now capable of defending herself and overpowering her enemies. However, in terms of her humanity and moral condition, she has fallen to a lower state, having become a monster.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc can be classified based on how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the narrative. Initially, Shiloh is in a disadvantaged and dangerous situation (low state). She faces multiple dilemmas and dangers, recovering slightly at times but overall descending into a worse state as the story progresses, especially with her transformation into a monster. This pattern does not fit the \"Rags to Riches,\" \"Man in a Hole,\" \"Cinderella,\" or \"Double Man in a Hole\" arcs because Shiloh does not end in a better condition than she started in terms of her humanity and safety. It also doesn't fit \"Riches to Rags\" perfectly because Shiloh starts in a low state and ends in a different kind of low state, having gained power but lost her humanity. The \"Icarus\" arc doesn't apply well either because Shiloh's rise is not about achieving success or height but about survival and transformation. \n\nThe closest fit is the \"Oedipus\" arc, where the protagonist starts high (or in this case, in a neutral human state), falls into a series of tragic events, recovers slightly (kills the monster Will), and then faces another significant downfall (transforms into a monster and loses her humanity). This arc captures the essence of a tragic fall from a state of innocence or normalcy into a state of monstrosity and loss.\n\n### 4. Determined Story Arc Type\n\nOedipus"

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Andrew, a twelve-year-old New Jersey resident at the beginning who grows into a young adult throughout the narrative. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. Andrew is rejected by a party host due to their age difference (sentence 1).\n2. Andrew meets Domino and her autistic daughter, Lola, at a bat mitzvah and begins to form a connection with them (sentences 4-6).\n3. Andrew is hired as Lola's sitter and starts developing feelings for Domino, despite her being engaged (sentences 14-15).\n4. Andrew confesses his love to Domino, but she rejects him, stating she is in love with her fianc\u00e9, Joseph (sentence 28).\n5. Andrew decides not to go to Barcelona and instead plans to move out, marking a significant change in his life direction (sentences 31-33).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State and Change at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: Andrew starts in a state of rejection and possibly low self-esteem due to the age difference being the reason for rejection. This sets a baseline of him being in a somewhat disadvantaged or vulnerable position.\n- **Event 2**: Andrew's state improves as he finds success and appreciation in his role at the bat mitzvah, meeting Domino and Lola, and starting to form meaningful connections. This marks an upward turn in his condition.\n- **Event 3**: Andrew's state continues to improve as he deepens his connection with Domino and Lola, finding employment as a sitter, and potentially seeing a romantic future with Domino. This represents a peak in his condition, with both personal and emotional fulfillment on the horizon.\n- **Event 4**: Andrew's state takes a significant downturn as he faces rejection from Domino, who chooses her engagement over the feelings she might have for him. This rejection, combined with the loss of his job as Lola's sitter, marks a low point in his condition.\n- **Event 5**: Andrew's state begins to recover as he decides to move on from the rejection and the idea of reuniting with Maya. He plans to move out and start anew, indicating a readiness to leave past disappointments behind and look forward to personal growth and independence. While not as high as his peak, this marks a step towards recovery and a new beginning.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the analysis, Andrew's story follows an **Icarus** arc. The Icarus story arc is characterized by the protagonist starting in a low state, rising to a peak, and then falling to a low point again. In Andrew's case:\n- He starts low (rejected at a young age, and then later facing a long-distance relationship with Maya).\n- He rises as he finds success and connection with Domino and Lola.\n- He peaks when he confesses his feelings to Domino, representing the highest point of his emotional investment and potential for happiness.\n- He falls when Domino rejects him and he loses his role as Lola's sitter, marking a significant downturn.\n- He ends in a state of recovery and newfound independence, deciding to move on and start anew, though this final state is more about acceptance and moving forward rather than returning to a previous high.\n\nThis pattern aligns with the Icarus arc, where the protagonist experiences a dramatic rise followed by a fall, and then concludes in a state that reflects a degree of recovery or acceptance of their circumstances.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To analyze the story arc, let's first identify the protagonist and key events.\n\n1. **Protagonist Identification and Major Events:**\n   - The protagonist of the story can be considered as Deputy Sheriff Joe \"Deke\" Deacon, given that the narrative revolves significantly around his actions, backstory, and emotional state.\n   - Five major events in the story are:\n     1. Deacon is sent to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department to collect evidence (sentence 3), marking his entry into the new case.\n     2. Deacon notices similarities between the current murder and an old serial murder case he was unable to solve (sentence 6), which sparks his obsession.\n     3. The FBI is set to take over the investigation (sentence 17), increasing pressure on Deacon and Baxter.\n     4. Deacon and Baxter's illegal search of Sparma's apartment (sentence 21) leads to complications and raises the stakes.\n     5. The final confrontation where Baxter kills Sparma (sentence 30), and the aftermath where Deacon advises Baxter to forget the case (sentence 34), conclude the main conflict.\n\n2. **Protagonist's State at Each Event:**\n   - **Event 1:** Deacon is in a professional, somewhat stable state, being tasked with collecting evidence.\n   - **Event 2:** His state becomes more intense and possibly obsessive as he connects the current case to his past failure, indicating a slight decline in his emotional well-being due to the resurgence of unresolved issues.\n   - **Event 3:** The pressure from the FBI's impending involvement adds stress, potentially lowering his state further as he feels the need to solve the case before it's taken away from him.\n   - **Event 4:** The illegal search and its consequences put Deacon in a risky and compromised position, both professionally and personally, marking a significant downfall.\n   - **Event 5:** After the confrontation and the advice to Baxter, Deacon seems to be in a reflective state, having ensured that the case is closed in his own way, but also haunted by his past and the events of the story, suggesting a complex mix of resolution and lingering personal issues.\n\n3. **Story Arc Classification:**\n   - The story arc of \"Oedipus\" is characterized by a protagonist who starts high, falls, recovers, and then faces another significant downfall. In Deacon's case, he begins in a position of authority and stability (high), becomes obsessed and risks his profession (fall), seems to find a way to deal with his past through the investigation (recovery), but ultimately ends up covering up a murder and is haunted by his past actions (another downfall).\n   - This pattern fits because Deacon's journey is marked by his inability to escape his past mistakes and obsessions, leading to a series of events that ultimately result in him being in a worse state than where he began, both morally and emotionally.\n\n4. **Determined Story Arc Type:**\nOedipus"

Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **Initial Isolation (sentence 2):** Edee's state is one of intentional isolation and attempted self-sufficiency, driven by her desire to escape the trauma of her past. Her condition is low due to her recent traumatic experience and her struggles with basic provisions.\n\n2. **Breaking Point (sentence 6):** Edee's state deteriorates to its lowest point as she attempts to take her life, indicating a complete overwhelm by her circumstances and emotional pain.

From there, with the help of Miguel and their developing friendship, her condition improves as she learns to survive and eventually confronts her past. This trajectory shows a character who falls into a dilemma (her isolation and struggle to survive, culminating in a suicide attempt), finds a way out with the help of others, and ends in a better state than where she started, having begun to heal and reconnect with the world.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\nThe protagonist of the story is Rose. Five major events in the story are:\n1. Rose leads the human fleet against the aliens and freezes before she can fire, resulting in the destruction of one of her ships (sentence 3).\n2. Rose sacrifices thousands of humans to destroy the Armada, saving Earth but leaving her wracked with guilt (sentence 5).\n3. A viral pandemic strikes the Pilots, and Rose is captured by the resistance, leading to her agreeing to join a mission to Cobalt One to find the Armada's core drive (sentences 8-12).\n4. Rose and her team reach the Armada on Cobalt One, where she is briefly possessed by the Harvester Matriarch, discovers the truth about her past, and decides to steal the core drive (sentences 17-19).\n5. Rose discovers the truth about the virus, stops the Matriarch's attempt to destroy Earth, and ultimately finds a way to cure the infected Pilots (sentences 25-31).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n- **Event 1 (Rose freezes during the battle):** Rose is in a state of uncertainty and fear, which leads to a significant failure. Her condition is poor due to her inability to perform under pressure.\n- **Event 2 (Rose destroys the Armada):** Rose's condition worsens emotionally as she is wracked with guilt over the sacrifices she made. However, her action is a success in terms of saving Earth, indicating a mix of emotional downfall and strategic success.\n- **Event 3 (The viral pandemic and Rose's capture):** Rose's physical and emotional state is at a low. She is living in hiding, avoiding the resistance, and dealing with the aging effects of her hybrid nature. Her capture and the pandemic indicate a further decline in her condition.\n- **Event 4 (Possession by the Harvester Matriarch and discovery):** Rose's condition improves as she discovers the truth about her past and her powers. She begins to embrace who she is and finds a new sense of purpose, indicating an upward trend in her emotional and psychological state.\n- **Event 5 (Stopping the Matriarch and curing the Pilots):** Rose's condition improves significantly as she finds redemption by saving the Pilots and stopping the genocide. She also gains a new understanding of herself and her abilities, leading to a higher state of being compared to the beginning of the story.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\nThe story follows a pattern where the protagonist, Rose, faces significant downturns (freezing during the battle, guilt over destroying the Armada, living in hiding) but then experiences improvements (embracing her powers, finding a way to cure the Pilots). This pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist faces challenges, recovers, and ultimately ends in a better state than where she started. Given the cycles of dilemma and recovery, and considering the overall trend from a low point to a higher point by the end of the story, the story arc type appears to align with the **Double Man in a Hole** or could be interpreted as a **Cinderella** story due to Rose's rise, setback, and ultimate achievement of a higher state. However, the detailed cycles of downfall and recovery, especially considering the guilt and redemption arc, more closely fit the **Double Man in a Hole** pattern.\n\n### 4.

This introduces a challenge and a potential downfall.\n- **Event 3**: As Maya and Willy take on the mission, Maya's state becomes one of adventure and responsibility. Despite facing challenges, she shows resilience and determination, indicating an improvement or a rise in her condition as she works towards a goal.\n- **Event 4**: Being trapped and feeling they have failed represents a low point for Maya, a significant setback where her condition worsens.\n- **Event 5**: With the successful rescue and completion of their mission, Maya's state improves dramatically. She achieves a higher state than at the beginning, having saved Bonsai Peak, ensured she and Willy can stay together, and earned recognition.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the changes in Maya's state throughout the story, we observe a pattern where she starts in a positive state, faces a potential downfall (threat of separation), rises as she takes on a challenge (the mission to save Smoosh), faces a significant setback (being trapped), and ultimately achieves a higher state than at the beginning (successful completion of the mission and recognition). This pattern aligns with the **Cinderella** story arc type, where the protagonist rises, faces a setback, and ultimately achieves a higher state. The key elements here are the initial positive state, the introduction of a challenge or potential downfall, the proactive efforts to overcome this challenge, a significant setback, and finally, a triumphant conclusion that surpasses the initial state.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To classify the story arc type of the given story, we first need to identify the protagonist and key events in the narrative.\n\n1. **Identify the Protagonist and Major Events:**\n   - The story seems to focus on multiple characters, but if we had to identify a central figure around whom the story revolves, it could be argued that Frank, the young widower, is the protagonist due to his significant character development and emotional journey.\n   - Five major events in the story are:\n     1. Frank's struggle with sudden fatherhood and his introduction (sentence 5).\n     2. The decision to take a trip to Fiji, which is sparked during the Ohio State-Michigan football game (sentence 8).\n     3. The group's arrival in Fiji and the challenges they face, including a postponed flight and a tropical storm (sentences 14 and 17).\n     4. The climax of the story, where despite the storm, connections are made, and significant personal moments occur, such as Frank and Amanda finding connection and Sam serenading Olivia (sentence 21).\n     5. The group's return to San Francisco, realizing they have formed a bond that resembles a found family (sentence 27).\n\n2. **Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes:**\n   - **Event 1:** Frank is introduced in a state of struggle, coping with the loss of his wife and the challenges of being a new father. His condition is low due to grief and the difficulties of single parenthood.\n   - **Event 2:** The decision to go to Fiji represents a turning point where Frank begins to look for a way out of his current predicament, seeking escape and possibly a new beginning. His condition starts to improve slightly as he finds a distraction and potential for happiness.\n   - **Event 3:** In Fiji, despite the initial challenges, Frank is among people who care for him, and this social support starts to uplift him. However, the challenges they face could also be seen as a temporary setback.\n   - **Event 4:** The connections made during the storm signify a significant improvement in Frank's condition. He finds companionship and possibly love with Amanda, which is a major positive development.\n   - **Event 5:** By the end of the story, Frank has formed meaningful bonds with the people he traveled with, effectively creating a new family dynamic that supports him and his son. This marks a substantial improvement in his condition from the beginning of the story.\n\n3. **Classify the Story Arc Type:**\n   - The story follows Frank as he faces significant personal challenges (the loss of his wife and the struggles of single parenthood), then finds a path towards improvement and happiness through his journey to Fiji and the connections he makes there. This journey involves facing setbacks (such as the storm) but ultimately ending in a better state than where he began. The pattern of facing a dilemma, finding a way out, and ending better than at the start aligns with the **\"Man in a Hole\"** story arc. However, given the classification provided in the task as **\"Double Man in a Hole,\"** we must consider if there are two distinct cycles of dilemma and recovery. While Frank's story is primarily one of progression from a low point to a high point with challenges along the way, the classification of **\"Double Man in a Hole\"** suggests recognizing two phases of falling into a hole and climbing out, which might be a bit of a stretch based on the events outlined. The primary arc of improvement from grief and single parenthood to finding love and a new family structure is clear, but identifying two clear cycles of dilemma and recovery is less so.\n\n4. **Determined Story Arc Type:**\nDouble Man in Hole"

Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Charlie's Nightmare and Loss of Control**: Charlie has a nightmare and her parents discuss her unstable powers (sentences 3-4).\n2. **The Death of Charlie's Mother**: Rainbird kills Charlie's mother, leading to Charlie and her father escaping (sentences 10-12).\n3. **Charlie's Escape and Growth**: Charlie escapes from her captors and hones her powers in the forest (sentences 21-22).\n4. **The Rescue and Tragic Turn**: Charlie rescues her father from the DSI facility but is tricked into burning him and others (sentences 25-28).\n5. **The Final Confrontation and Resolution**: Charlie spares Rainbird's life and burns down the DSI facility, walking away with him (sentences 32-35).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Charlie's Nightmare and Loss of Control)**: Charlie is in a vulnerable state, struggling with her powers and being bullied at school. Her condition is tense and precarious.\n- **Event 2 (The Death of Charlie's Mother)**: Charlie's state worsens significantly as she experiences trauma and loss. She and her father are forced to flee, making their situation dire.\n- **Event 3 (Charlie's Escape and Growth)**: Charlie's condition improves as she learns to control her powers and becomes more independent. This marks a turning point in her ability to cope with her circumstances.\n- **Event 4 (The Rescue and Tragic Turn)**: Charlie's state becomes extremely tragic. Despite her growth, she is manipulated into causing destruction and harm to those she loves, leading to a deep emotional and moral conflict.\n- **Event 5 (The Final Confrontation and Resolution)**: Charlie's condition reaches a point of resolution and potential redemption. She chooses to spare a life and finds a form of companionship or understanding with Rainbird, indicating a move towards healing and a new path.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc can be classified based on how Charlie's condition changes throughout the narrative. Initially, Charlie is in a vulnerable state, which worsens after her mother's death. However, she then experiences growth and improvement as she learns to control her powers. This is followed by a tragic turn of events, but ultimately, she finds a path towards redemption and a new beginning.\n\nGiven these changes, the story does not fit neatly into a simple \"Rags to Riches\" or \"Riches to Rags\" narrative, as Charlie's journey involves both significant downturns and moments of growth. The \"Man in a Hole\" arc is closer, as Charlie falls into dilemmas (her loss of control, her mother's death) and finds ways out (learning to control her powers, choosing to spare Rainbird), ending in a better emotional state than where she began, despite the tragic events.\n\nThe \"Double Man in a Hole\" arc seems most appropriate because Charlie faces two major cycles of falling into a dilemma and recovering: the first cycle involves her initial struggles and the traumatic event of her mother's death, from which she recovers by escaping and growing; the second cycle involves her tragic manipulation into burning her father and others, from which she recovers by finding redemption in sparing Rainbird's life and walking away from the destruction.\n\n### 4.

support of their newest product, Klaralon.\n3) The drug is being touted as the first non-addictive painkiller and is due to be released shortly as a replacement for Oxycodone.\n4) The study uncovers concerning results; Klaralon initially presents as non-addictive when taken daily for the first 7 days (parameters specified by Northlight), however after 7 days it becomes almost three times more addictive than Oxycodone.\n5) Realising the public health implications, Brower recommends to Northlight they delay Klaralon's release for further testing, which they object to.\n6) Board member Dr. Bill Simons tries to tempt Brower into changing his mind by offering a large research grant, but Brower refuses.\n7) With Northlight being one of the university's main donors, Brower finds himself under pressure from department head Greg Talbot to approve the study, but again is reluctant.\n8) Northlight begins leaking information to discredit his reputation, and Everett University revokes his tenure.\n9) Desperate, Brower becomes a whistleblower and contacts the FDA, being put in contact with investigator Ben Walker.\n10) Detroit based DEA agent Jake Kelly has managed to infiltrate two large scale drug cartels running fentanyl.\n11) One is run by the Armenian Mafia who operate pill mills across the US.\n12) The other is based in Montreal, Quebec controlled by drug kingpin Claude 'Mother' Veroche, who operates out of a nondescript restaurant called La Marina.\n13) Kelly intends to convince the two cartels to enter into business, so both leaders can be arrested at once when they meet.\n14) Kelly has personal motivation for bringing them down, due to his younger sister suffering from crippling heroin addiction.\n15) Kelly's relationship with Mother becomes strained when news of Cedric's capture comes to light, with Mother becoming concerned there is an informant in his organisation.\n16) Due to operational funding concerns, Kelly's superior agent Garrett gives him a reduced timescale to organise the meet between the two cartels.\n17) Mother has Cedric killed in custody for his silence, and executes his second in command Guy Broussard after discovering he has been speaking with the authorities.\n18) Architect and recovering Oxycodone addict Claire Reimann becomes concerned when her 16-year-old son David does not return home from hockey practice.\n19) He is later found dead as a result of a fentanyl overdose, shocking Claire who is convinced he never took drugs.\n20) Although the Detroit Police Department treats it as an accidental death, she hires a private investigator who determines David was forced to take the fentanyl and was murdered.\n21) Through her son's social media she tracks down one of his friends, who confesses several teenagers from the hockey team (from both Detroit and Montreal) work for Mother as drug runners, although David had only done it once.\n22) Reimann crosses the Ambassador Bridge and travels to Montreal where she hires another private investigator, who provides her with information on Mother and a privately made firearm.\n23) She threatens another drug runner, Derrick Millebran, who believes that Mother is killing them to tie up loose ends after Cedric's arrest.\n24) Kelly becomes aware of Reimann's activities through investigation of Cedric's associates, and intercepts her outside La Marina.\n25) He does not arrest her, but instead unloads her gun and urges her to leave for her own good.\n26) The meeting between the two cartels goes ahead, covertly monitored by a joint DEA-RCMP taskforce.\n27) However, an RCMP surveillance officer accidentally gives away his position, resulting in a shootout that kills Kelly's partner, Special Agent Stanley Foster.\n28) Mother also escapes, believed to have fled to Algeria.\n29) Given the seizure of the drugs at the meet, both US and Canadian agencies decide to disband the continued search for Mother and the Armenians.\n30) Outraged, Kelly goes against orders and travels to La Marina, where he threatens an employee who tells him Mother is still in Canada but is planning to escape via seaplane that evening from the Port of Montreal.\n31) Reimann is also given this information from her private investigator.\n32) Kelly arrives at the port, but has been beaten there by Reimann, who opens fire and kills Mother as he makes his way to the aircraft.\n33) His bodyguard shoots her in the arm, but is swiftly shot by Kelly.\n34) He then replaces the men's weapons with Reimann's privately made firearm and his own unregistered back up gun, to make it appear they shot each other in a disagreement over money that was being carried by Mother at the time.\n35) He treats her gunshot wound, and tells her he does not intend to arrest her.\n36) A last ditch effort by Northlight, CEO Dr. Meg Holmes also fails to convince Brower to come on side, and the company is subjected to an FDA hearing.\n37) To Brower's shock, the agency does not revoke Northlight's permissions for Klaralon's release, noting that the potential benefits to the public outweigh the dangers highlighted by his study.\n38) Walker is also reassigned as a retaliatory measure.\n39) Despite the legal risk, Brower breaks his non-disclosure agreement and goes to the press, finally getting the information public.\n40) His integrity and honesty pays off, and he is later

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe story has multiple characters, but for the purpose of analyzing the story arc, we'll focus on Dr. Tyrone Brower as the primary protagonist, given his central role in the narrative's thematic concern with the ethical implications of pharmaceutical development.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. Dr. Brower discovers concerning results about Klaralon's addictive properties after 7 days of use (sentence 4).\n2. He recommends delaying Klaralon's release but faces opposition from Northlight Pharmaceuticals (sentence 5).\n3. Brower becomes a whistleblower and contacts the FDA (sentence 9).\n4. The FDA hearing does not result in the revocation of Northlight's permissions for Klaralon's release, prompting Brower to go to the press (sentences 36-37).\n5. Brower's integrity and honesty pay off, and he is later hired by the University of Michigan (sentence 40).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: Brower is in a position of professional integrity, having conducted a study that reveals critical information about Klaralon. His state is one of moral strength but also of impending conflict due to the implications of his findings.\n- **Event 2**: Brower's state worsens as he faces pressure and bribery attempts from Northlight and later from his own university, indicating a fall into a dilemma where his professional and ethical standings are challenged.\n- **Event 3**: By becoming a whistleblower, Brower takes a significant risk but acts in accordance with his ethical beliefs, showing a recovery in his moral stance but possibly a decline in his professional security.\n- **Event 4**: The FDA's decision not to revoke Klaralon's release despite Brower's evidence puts him in a deeper hole, professionally and ethically, as his efforts seem to be thwarted by the system.\n- **Event 5**: Brower's decision to go public with the information and his subsequent hiring by the University of Michigan mark a significant improvement in his state, both professionally and ethically, as his integrity is recognized and rewarded.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. Initially, Brower is in a strong moral and professional position. He then falls into a dilemma due to the opposition he faces from Northlight and his university, which challenges his professional and ethical standing. Despite setbacks, including the FDA's decision, Brower's actions ultimately lead to a higher state of recognition and respect for his integrity and honesty.\n\nThis pattern follows the **Man in a Hole** story arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma but finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning. Brower's journey from a position of strength, into conflict and professional jeopardy, and finally to a place of greater respect and recognition, aligns with this arc.\n\n### 4.

sheer faith and unyielding spirit, Father John held his ground, and his chants echoed throughout, weakening the unseen demonic entity and driving it out of Maria's tormented being.\n38) Finally, Maria collapsed onto the old wooden floor as the last demonic wail died down.\n39) The house, once the epicenter of chaos, was now overshadowed by an eerie yet relieving silence.\n40) Initial hesitation turned into joyous relief.\n41) The villagers broke into a chorus of relieved laughter, realizing that their horrifying ordeal was finally over, and the nightmare was behind them.\n42) The lines of never-ending terror once etched on their faces now glowed with newfound gratitude towards their savior, Father John, who liberated them from a monstrous ordeal that had disrupted their tranquil existence.\n43) After the arduous spiritual combat against the malevolent entity, a physically depleted Father John stepped out of Maria's house.\n44) He was spiritually fulfilled, having freed an innocent soul from the demonic clutches.\n45) Maria's liberation marked a turning point in the once tormented town of San Augustin.\n46) Life slowly reclaimed normalcy as laughter and Flamenco

towards her savior, Father John.\n48) Overwhelmed by her miraculous salvation, she pledged her services to the church and Father John, vowing to do everything within her means as a token of her gratitude.\n49) Having successfully completed his divine mission, Father John bid his goodbye to a now peaceful and lively San Augustin, returning to his sacred sanctuary in Rome.\n50) Maria\u2019s case served as yet another testament strengthening his belief and determination to fight the demonic forces.\n51) The vigorous exorcism further motivated his spiritual journey as a warrior of God.\n52) Back in his solemn study room in Rome, Father John resumed his research on demonic possessions.\n53) His encounter with Maria further deepened his understanding, and his notes of the experience further broadened the archive of his struggles against the supernatural.\n54) Maria's exorcism formed a crucial chapter in his distinguished track record of triumph over demonic forces.\n55) It was a tale that spoke volumes about his victories and the traumatic experience that changed the life of a town once ruled by fear.\n56) Father John, now instilled with renewed vigor, remained ever ready for his next mission.\n57) The narrative of the Spanish exorcism furthered his relentless pursuit to protect innocent souls from the clutches of dark, unknown forces.\n\nStory Arc

Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, the narrative follows a pattern where Father John faces a challenge (the demonic possession of Maria), works through the dilemma (convincing the villagers and performing the exorcism), and ends in a better state than when he started (having successfully freed Maria and reinforced his mission). This pattern aligns with the **Man in a Hole** story arc type, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (in this case, the challenge of freeing Maria) and finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning. Father John's journey through the story involves a descent into the problem (the possession and the resistance from villagers) and an ascent to a resolution (the successful exorcism), which characterizes the **Man in a Hole** arc.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Jeff, an inmate at Spiderhead, a state-of-the-art penitentiary where experiments with research chemicals are conducted.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. Jeff is given N-40, a \"love drug\", which distorts his senses and drives him to have sex with two of his fellow inmates (sentence 6).\n2. Heather commits suicide while on the Darkenfloxx after Jeff reluctantly agrees to her being administered the drug (sentence 11).\n3. Jeff discovers that there are no \"higher-ups\" and that the prison is run by Abnesti Pharmaceuticals, Steve's company (sentence 14).\n4. Jeff forces Steve to admit the true goal of the program and takes control of Steve's MobiPak (sentence 22).\n5. Jeff and Lizzy escape from Spiderhead after overpowering some of the other inmates (sentence 30).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1 (Jeff is given N-40):** Jeff's state is one of emotional turmoil, still reeling from his past actions. The administration of N-40 introduces chaos and confusion into his life, as his emotions and perceptions are altered.\n- **Event 2 (Heather's suicide):** Jeff's state worsens as he experiences horror and guilt over Heather's death. This event deepens his emotional turmoil and introduces a sense of responsibility and regret.\n- **Event 3 (Discovery of Abnesti Pharmaceuticals' control):** Jeff's state begins to shift towards empowerment and distrust. He starts to question the true motives behind the experiments and feels a sense of betrayal, which motivates him to take action.\n- **Event 4 (Forcing Steve to admit the truth):** Jeff's state improves significantly as he gains control and understanding. He transitions from being a victim of the experiments to becoming an active participant in his own destiny, seeking to expose the truth and protect himself and others.\n- **Event 5 (Escape from Spiderhead):** Jeff's state reaches a peak of liberation and hope. He and Lizzy escape, symbolizing a new beginning and a chance for redemption and forgiveness.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. Initially, Jeff is in a low state, struggling with guilt and the consequences of his actions. He then faces a series of challenges and downturns, particularly with Heather's suicide, which worsens his condition. However, as he discovers the truth about the facility and takes action against Steve, Jeff's condition begins to improve. He experiences a significant uplift when he forces Steve to admit the truth and when he and Lizzy escape, marking a transition from a state of oppression and guilt to one of freedom and hope.\n\nThis pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist faces significant challenges, falls into a dilemma, but then finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning. This is characteristic of the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist's condition improves from the first turning point to the last turning point. However, given the complexity and the dual nature of Jeff's journey (facing a dilemma, finding a temporary resolution, facing another dilemma, and then finally escaping), it could also align with the \"Double Man in a Hole\" arc, which involves two cycles of dilemma and recovery.\n\nGiven the provided classification of the story arc as \"Double Man in Hole,\" it seems to accurately reflect Jeff's journey, as he experiences multiple lows (the aftermath of the car accident, Heather's death, the revelation about the facility) and highs (discovering the truth, escaping with Lizzy), indicative of facing and overcoming multiple challenges.\n\n### 4.

that gives her the appearance of a 9-year-old child, orchestrates an escape from the Saarne Institute by seducing and killing a guard and hiding in the car of an art therapist named Anna.\n2) After breaking into Anna's house and killing her, Leena looks up missing American girls and finds that she bears a striking resemblance to Esther Albright, a girl from a rich family who went missing in 2003.\n3) Later, posing as a lost girl, Leena is approached by a Russian police officer and introduces herself as \"Esther\", claiming that her parents are in the United States.\n4) In Darien, Connecticut, wealthy artist Allen Albright and his wife Tricia, who has since come to terms with the disappearance of their daughter, are informed by Detective Donnan that \"Esther\" has been found.\n5) Tricia travels to the U.S. embassy in Moscow where she is \"reunited\" with Esther.\n6) Tricia brings Esther home and immediately starts to have doubts when she notices that Esther has forgotten about the death of her grandmother or that her painting skills have increased enormously compared to before she disappeared.\n7) Leena falls in love with Allen after they both start bonding over their painting skills, and tries to separate him from Tricia.\n8) While Tricia and Allen attend a charity gala hosted by Tricia, Donnan arrives at the house and steals a vinyl record from Esther's room which has Leena's fingerprints on it.\n9) He takes it back to his house, unaware that Leena has followed him, and analyzes the fingerprints to find it is not a match.\n10) Leena attacks Donnan and stabs him with a knife repeatedly, before Tricia arrives, having followed Leena.\n11) Instead of stopping Leena, Tricia opens fire on Donnan with a gun and kills him.\n12) Tricia reveals that she knows Leena is not Esther, who died four years earlier during an altercation with her older brother Gunnar, which Tricia covered up without Allen's knowledge.\n13) Tricia explains that she is only welcoming Leena to make Allen happy again and that if she refuses to cooperate, she would report her to the authorities for \"murdering\" Donnan.\n14) Leena reveals her true identity to Tricia, and the two then dispose of Donnan's body in a cellar hatch where the real Esther is buried and frame his disappearance as a vacation trip by forging an email to the police station.\n15) Tricia eventually terminates the deal but realizing that it would be too suspicious if \"Esther\" were to disappear again, Tricia and Gunnar pretend that Leena is still \"Esther\" in Allen's presence.\n16) Later, Tricia tries to poison Leena during dinner but Leena retaliates by feeding Tricia with a dead rat smoothie (the rat having died from eating Leena's poisoned food).\n17) She also attempts to push Tricia and Gunnar onto the railway tracks but is stopped by an incoming passenger.\n18) With Allen away at an art gallery exhibition, Leena tries fleeing by stealing Tricia's car, but she is soon found by a police officer.\n19) That night, Leena is brought back to the Albright house and Tricia and Gunnar finally decide to kill Leena for good.\n20) Tricia tries to stage a suicide, but Leena fights back and flees before Gunnar throws her down the stairs.\n21) Distracted by a phone call from Allen, who is returning home, Tricia and Gunnar search for Leena when she disappears.\n22) Gunnar eventually finds Leena in the art room but Leena shoots Gunnar with a crossbow and then stabs him to death with his fencing sword.\n23) An enraged Tricia and Leena fight in the kitchen, inadvertently setting the house alight in the process, and the pair flee to the roof as Allen returns home.\n24) Tricia and Leena both slip and end up clinging to the roof, begging Allen to save them, with Leena claiming Tricia attacked her, and Tricia trying to reveal the truth about Leena.\n25) Unable to save both of them, Allen chooses to help \"Esther\", causing Tricia to lose her grip and fall to her death.\n26) Allen then checks Leena's face, which causes her fake teeth to fall out.\n27) Realizing she is not Esther, Leena tries to defend herself by saying she did it for them and also confesses her love for him.\n28) Allen calls her a monster, causing an enraged Leena to accidentally push him off the roof.\n29) Leena then again dresses herself as Esther and leaves the burning house after cleaning off the blood on her face.\n30) Later, \"Esther\" is moved to an orphanage where she waits for a new family to adopt her.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts

Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **Event 1 (Escape from Saarne Institute):** Leena is in a confined and controlled environment, but she manages to escape, which initially improves her state from captive to free.\n2. **Event 2 (Posing as \"Esther\"):** Leena's state improves significantly as she gains a new family and a life of luxury, moving from a life of confinement and possibly abuse to one of comfort and acceptance.\n3. **Event 3 (Tricia's Discovery):** Leena's state becomes precarious as Tricia knows her true identity but decides to keep her secret for her own reasons. This introduces a element of risk and unpredictability to Leena's life.\n4. **Event 4 (Deterioration of Leena and Tricia's Relationship):** Leena's state worsens as she and Tricia engage in a dangerous game of cat and mouse, with both attempting to harm or kill the other. This period is marked by high tension and constant threat to her life.\n5. **Event 5 (Final Confrontation):** Leena's state improves temporarily as she manages to outsmart and kill her adversaries, securing her freedom once again. However, she also faces the loss of her newfound \"family\" and the life she had built, and she must start anew.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the fluctuations in Leena's state throughout the story, it's clear that she faces significant challenges and dangers but also experiences periods of improvement and success. The story starts with Leena in a disadvantaged situation (in an institute), improves as she finds a new \"family\" and life, deteriorates as her secret is discovered and she faces threats to her life, and finally ends with her securing her freedom but losing the life she had built.\n\nThis pattern does not fit neatly into a simple \"Rags to Riches\" or \"Riches to Rags\" arc, as Leena's condition fluctuates significantly throughout the story. It also doesn't perfectly match the \"Icarus\" arc, as Leena does not rise to a position of power or success before falling. The \"Man in a Hole\" arc is the closest fit, as Leena falls into dilemmas (being discovered, facing threats) and finds ways out (killing her adversaries, securing her freedom), but the complexity of her situation and the multiple cycles of dilemma and recovery suggest a more nuanced interpretation.\n\nHowever, the provided classification is \"Man in Hole,\" which suggests focusing on the overall trend of Leena facing challenges and finding ways to overcome them, even if the story has more complexity than a single arc type can fully encapsulate.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Matilda, an unworldly woman from the quaint provincial town of Green Creek. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. Matilda lands an opportunity to work as a personal assistant for Mrs. Cardwell in Las Vegas (sentence 1).\n2. Matilda and Jonathan discover that his wife's death was the outcome of industrial sabotage planned and executed by a crime syndicate (sentence 7).\n3. They find out that their employer, Mrs. Cardwell, is tangled in the deceit, using her charitable foundations to camouflage money laundering for The Velvet Hammer (sentence 11).\n4. Matilda and Jonathan are ambushed by mercenaries of The Velvet Hammer, but Matilda manages to escape with damning evidence (sentence 14).\n5. Matilda decides to hand over the incriminating evidence to Officer Murphy, leading to a city-wide manhunt and the eventual arrest of the mob members (sentence 17).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: Matilda's state is one of transition and uncertainty as she leaves her calm life in Green Creek for a new, fast-paced life in Las Vegas. Her condition is somewhat vulnerable but hopeful for a better life.\n- **Event 2**: Upon discovering the truth about Jonathan's wife's death, Matilda's state becomes more determined and involved. She moves from being a passive observer in her new life to an active participant in seeking justice. Her condition worsens in terms of the danger and complexity she faces but improves in terms of her resolve and purpose.\n- **Event 3**: Learning about Mrs. Cardwell's involvement in the crime syndicate adds to Matilda's distress and sense of betrayal. Her state becomes more precarious as she navigates a web of deceit that includes her employer. However, this also strengthens her resolve to fight against the corruption. Her condition, in terms of external safety, worsens, but internally, she becomes more resilient.\n- **Event 4**: Being ambushed by mercenaries puts Matilda in a state of immediate danger, which is a significant low point. However, her ability to outmaneuver them and escape with evidence shows her growth into a more capable and courageous individual. Her condition, in terms of personal strength and determination, improves significantly.\n- **Event 5**: By deciding to hand over the evidence, Matilda takes a decisive step towards bringing about justice and change. Her state is one of courage and determination. This action leads to a significant improvement in her condition, as it sets in motion the downfall of the crime syndicate and the transformation of Las Vegas.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, Matilda starts in a somewhat disadvantaged or uncertain situation (leaving her home for an unknown life in Las Vegas), faces significant challenges and dangers (discovery of the crime syndicate, ambush, etc.), but ultimately ends in a much better situation (bringing about justice, finding love, and contributing to the transformation of Las Vegas). This pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (the challenges and dangers in Las Vegas) but finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning.\n\nThe story arc that best fits this description is the \"Man in a Hole\" arc, where the protagonist's condition improves from the first turning point to the last turning point, despite facing significant challenges and setbacks along the way.\n\n### 4.

using this method, she quickly confirms that the spirit is not a friendly one.\n9) Seylan explains that Jemma's prank, which involved fabricating a deceased person, may have led a tulpa to take on the guise of the deceased person and wear his identity like a mask that allows the demon to pass into the world of the living.\n10) She gives them instructions on how to close the s\u00e9ance, but the demon interrupts her and she is disconnected again before the girls attempt to close the circle using her advice.\n11) Relieved that the ordeal seems to be over, the members of the group begin to leave the call.\n12) Radina leaves the room, unaware of her boyfriend Alan's body hanging behind her.\n13) Caroline's Zoom background, which shows a looping video of her doing chores, continues playing as the real Caroline suddenly has her face smashed into the camera.\n14) Forgetting to switch off a filter that superimposes masks and face paint onto her, Emma turns her camera towards her living room, where the filter places a kabuki mask on an invisible figure which then turns to look at her.\n15) She runs away and scatters flour on the floor, showing the footprints of the demon approaching her.\n16) Her kitchen cupboards burst open before the demon attacks her, but she escapes into her bedroom.\n17) Radina attempts to flee after Alan's body drops down behind her, but the demon kills her by throwing her into the wall.\n18) Noticing that Caroline is typing gibberish in the chat, Haley and Jemma watch as her camera turns back on to show her being killed by the demon repeatedly smashing her head into her keyboard while she pleads for help.\n19) Haley and Jemma argue and blame each other before Haley is pulled out of the room.\n20) Jemma, who lives around the corner from Haley, immediately leaves her home to help.\n21) Teddy returns to the call to see that only Emma remains, and a warning pops up to remind the group that the call will end in 10 minutes unless they upgrade to the premium version of Zoom.\n22) Unaware of everything that has occurred, Teddy believes Emma is pranking him, but he is attacked by the demon after it takes the form of a horrifying humanoid figure.\n23) He is chased into his garden, where he sees Jinny being lifted into the air before her neck is snapped and her body falls into the swimming pool.\n24) He runs away and hides, using a lighter to see where he is going, but the demon distracts him with an eerie music box his brother used to prank him with as a child.\n25) The demon then knocks him down and he drops the lighter, causing a fire that burns him to death.\n26) Emma, now the only person still active in the call, fearfully turns her camera towards the door of her room after it opens.\n27) She throws a blanket, which drapes itself over an invisible human shape.\n28) She opens her window to escape, but trips and falls to her death.\n29) Jemma breaks into Haley's home and checks the Zoom call on Haley's laptop to see that Emma and Teddy are dead.\n30) The demon smashes a wine bottle over her head and starts to destroy the kitchen, but she recovers and finds Haley hiding under her desk, with the pair attempting to escape the house using the flash of Haley's instant camera to light the way.\n31) The demon appears in the final flash of light, taking the form of a mutilated human, and rushes at them as the Zoom call timer expires.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better (e.g., 0\u21921\u21922\u21924\u219210)\n- Riches to Rags: Protagonist starts high and ends lower (e.g., 10\u21929\u21928\u21926\u21920)\n- Man in a Hole: Protagonist falls into trouble but recovers (e.g., 6\u21922\u21921\u21924\u219210)\n- Icarus: Protagonist rises then falls dramatically (e.g., 2\u21924\u21929\u21925\u21921)\n- Double Man in a Hole: Two cycles of fall and recovery (e.g., 6\u21922\u21927\u21924\u219210)\n- Cinderella: Rise, setback, ultimate triumph (e.g., 1\u21927\u21924\u21921\u219210)\n- Oedipus: Start high, fall, recover, final fall (e.g., 10\u21924\u21927\u21929\u21921)",
        "output": "To analyze the story arc, we first need to identify the protagonist and key events in the story.\n\n1. **Identify the protagonist and 5 major events:**\n   - The protagonist can be considered as the group of friends, but for the sake of analysis, let's focus on Haley, as she is one of the central characters throughout the story.\n   - Five major events in the story are:\n     1. The group participates in a virtual s\u00e9ance (sentence 2).\n     2. Jemma's prank and the subsequent terrifying phenomena experienced by the group (sentences 4-6).\n     3. Seylan explains that Jemma's prank may have led to a tulpa taking on the guise of a deceased person (sentence 9).\n     4. The demon interrupts Seylan and the group attempts to close the s\u00e9ance, leading to a series of horrific events (sentences 10-14).\n     5. The final confrontation and the demise of the remaining characters (sentences 26-31).\n\n2. **Describe the protagonist's state and how it changed relative to the previous events:**\n   - **Event 1 (Virtual S\u00e9ance):** Haley is enthusiastic and serious about the s\u00e9ance, indicating a state of anticipation and hope.\n   - **Event 2 (Jemma's Prank and Phenomena):** Haley's state changes to one of shock, anger, and concern as she realizes the prank's consequences.\n   - **Event 3 (Seylan's Explanation):** Haley's state becomes more informed but also increasingly fearful as she understands the potential consequences of Jemma's actions.\n   - **Event 4 (Demon's Interruption and Attempts to Close the S\u00e9ance):** Haley's state deteriorates further into panic and desperation as the group faces the demon's attacks.\n   - **Event 5 (Final Confrontation):** Haley's state is one of extreme fear and desperation, trying to escape with Jemma as the demon closes in.\n\n3. **Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain your reasoning:**\n   - The story starts with the protagonist (Haley and her friends) in a relatively stable, albeit bored, state during the lockdown. As the story progresses, their condition worsens significantly due to the supernatural events triggered by Jemma's prank. From the point of the s\u00e9ance onwards, the group's situation deteriorates rapidly, leading to a series of tragic events and deaths. The protagonist's condition does not improve at any point after the first turning point (the s\u00e9ance and its immediate aftermath); instead, it consistently worsens, leading to a horrific conclusion. This pattern, where the protagonist starts in a relatively better state and ends in a significantly worse state, aligns with the \"Riches to Rags\" story arc type.\n\n4. **Determined story arc type:**\nRiches to Rags"

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\nThe protagonist of the story is Sonny. Five major events in the story are:\n- Event 1: Sonny's decision to attend Huck's birthday celebration after initial reluctance (sentence 7).\n- Event 2: Sonny wards off a mountain lion with an EpiPen and earns the nickname \"Big Dog\" (sentence 13).\n- Event 3: The confrontation with Stan, Huck's loan shark, leads to Sonny's finger being broken, and the party site being burned down (sentence 18).\n- Event 4: Sonny offers his house for Huck's birthday celebration, which escalates into a rager (sentence 24).\n- Event 5: Sonny's family leaves him due to the out-of-control party, and he later apologizes and starts making amends (sentences 27-29).\n\n### 2. Analyzing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n- **Event 1**: Sonny's state changes from boredom and loneliness to excitement and engagement as he decides to join Huck's celebration. Initially, he was stuck in a routine, but this event marks a shift towards seeking adventure and reconnection with his past.\n- **Event 2**: Sonny's state improves significantly as he successfully defends himself against a mountain lion, earning respect and a new nickname. This event boosts his confidence and sense of capability.\n- **Event 3**: Sonny's state worsens as he faces violence and the destruction of the party site. This event introduces conflict and sets back Sonny's positive trajectory.\n- **Event 4**: Sonny's state appears to improve as he finds a way to continue the celebration and reconnect with Huck and potentially others. However, this event also sets the stage for future conflict, as the party's escalation will eventually lead to trouble with his family.\n- **Event 5**: Sonny's state hits a low point as his family leaves him, and he is forced to confront the consequences of his actions. This event marks a turning point towards recovery and making amends.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\nThe story arc type can be classified by examining the overall trend of the protagonist's condition throughout the story. Initially, Sonny is in a stable but unfulfilling state (being a stay-at-home dad), then he seeks adventure and experiences highs (earning the nickname \"Big Dog\") and lows (conflict with the loan shark, party getting out of control). The key to identifying the story arc is recognizing that despite some moments of improvement, Sonny's overall condition at the end is not significantly better than at the beginning; in fact, he faces a significant downfall (his family leaving him) before starting to make amends. This pattern does not fit \"Rags to Riches\" or \"Cinderella\" because Sonny does not end in a significantly better state. It also does not fit \"Riches to Rags\" because Sonny does not start in a high-status position. The pattern resembles \"Man in a Hole\" because Sonny falls into dilemmas (boredom, conflict, family trouble) and finds ways out, but the overall trajectory is more complex due to the multiple cycles of dilemma and recovery.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Xochitl, a young woman who is the central figure in the narrative, driving the plot forward with her actions and decisions related to environmental activism.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. **Xochitl's mother dies during a heat wave** (sentence 3), which motivates her to take more drastic action against environmental pollution.\n2. **The group devises a plan to detonate homemade explosives along an oil pipeline** (sentence 10), marking a significant escalation in their activism.\n3. **The group successfully blows up the pipeline** (sentence 19), which is the climax of their action and a moment of triumph for Xochitl and her companions.\n4. **Xochitl and Theo peacefully surrender** (sentence 27), indicating a shift from active rebellion to acceptance of consequences.\n5. **Theo dies shortly after being sentenced** (sentence 28), which is a tragic conclusion to the story, especially for Xochitl, who has lost a close friend and ally.\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1 (Xochitl's mother dies):** Xochitl's state is one of grief and frustration, motivated by the loss of her mother to environmental factors. This event sets her on a path of more radical action.\n- **Event 2 (Planning the pipeline explosion):** Xochitl's state is one of determination and planning, as she and her group prepare to take drastic action against the oil company. Her condition has shifted from grief to proactive engagement.\n- **Event 3 (The pipeline explosion):** Xochitl's state is one of triumph and fulfillment, having successfully executed their plan. This is a high point for her, as she feels she has made a significant statement and action against environmental pollution.\n- **Event 4 (Surrender):** Xochitl's state changes to one of resignation and acceptance, as she and Theo decide to surrender, acknowledging the legal consequences of their actions. This marks a downturn in her condition, as she must now face the repercussions of her actions.\n- **Event 5 (Theo's death):** Xochitl's state is one of loss and sadness, having lost a close friend and ally. This event further deteriorates her condition, leaving her not only in prison but also grieving.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the changes in Xochitl's condition throughout the story, we observe a pattern where she faces challenges (her mother's death, the struggle for environmental action), rises to a point of triumph (the successful sabotage), and then faces a significant downfall (surrender and Theo's death). This pattern does not fit the \"Rags to Riches\" or \"Cinderella\" arcs, as Xochitl's condition at the end is worse than at the beginning. It also doesn't fit \"Riches to Rags\" because Xochitl starts in a disadvantaged position and momentarily rises. The \"Man in a Hole\" arc is close, as Xochitl does fall into dilemmas and finds ways out, but the story's end, with Theo's death and Xochitl in prison, suggests a more complex pattern. The \"Icarus\" arc seems most fitting because Xochitl rises to a peak (the successful act of sabotage) but then falls significantly (surrender, prison, and Theo's death).\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\nThe protagonist of the story is George Washington. Five major events in the story are:\n1. Benedict Arnold murders the signatories of the Declaration of Independence and steals the document (sentence 1).\n2. Washington chases Arnold after Lincoln's death and fails to kill him (sentence 5).\n3. Washington meets Martha Dandridge at Lincoln's funeral, and she urges him to continue the revolution (sentence 6-7).\n4. The team finally tracks down Arnold at a Vietnam bar, but he escapes (sentence 12).\n5. Washington and his team defeat Arnold in the final battle (sentence 30).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n- **Event 1**: At the beginning, Washington's state is one of loss and chaos as his fellow signatories are murdered, and the Declaration of Independence is stolen. This sets a low point for him.\n- **Event 2**: Washington's state changes to one of pursuit and failure as he chases Arnold but cannot kill him. This indicates a slight improvement in determination but a failure in action.\n- **Event 3**: Meeting Martha and deciding to continue the revolution marks a turning point where Washington's state improves as he gains a new ally and a reason to keep fighting. His condition starts to rise.\n- **Event 4**: Tracking down Arnold but failing to capture him keeps Washington in a state of pursuit and slightly heightened desperation. His condition is somewhat stable, with a focus on the mission.\n- **Event 5**: Finally defeating Arnold marks the highest point for Washington, where his condition significantly improves as he achieves his goal of stopping the traitor and saving the country.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\nGiven the progression of Washington's state:\n- He starts in a disadvantaged situation (loss and chaos).\n- He faces setbacks and failures (chasing Arnold, failing to capture him).\n- He experiences improvements and gains allies (meeting Martha, forming a team).\n- He ultimately achieves a significant victory (defeating Arnold).\n\nThis pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist rises from a low point to a high point, with setbacks along the way, but ultimately achieves success. However, upon closer examination, Washington's journey does not perfectly fit the \"Rags to Riches\" or \"Man in a Hole\" archetypes because his rise to success is not linear, and he faces significant challenges that threaten his progress.\n\nThe story arc that best fits Washington's journey is the \"Icarus\" type, but with an important distinction: Icarus typically involves a rise followed by a drastic fall. Washington's story, however, ends on a high note with his victory over Arnold and the establishment of America. This discrepancy suggests that the provided classification of \"Icarus\" might not fully capture the essence of Washington's storyline, which seems more aligned with a heroic rise and ultimate triumph.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identify the protagonist and 5 major events in the story\n\nThe protagonist in the story is Dr. John Collins, a renowned anatomy professor at Harvard University. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. John discovers eerie parallels between his anatomical illustrations and Liz's macabre stage settings (event 5).\n2. John finds a sinister anatomy lab in Liz's basement rehearsal studio, hinting at a chilling narrative (event 9).\n3. John realizes that several of his brilliant anatomy students have disappeared, leaving behind only traceless absentee letters (event 13).\n4. John discovers the horrifying truth that Liz has been stealing organs from his missing students for use as props in her productions (event 16).\n5. John confronts Liz, leading to a near-apocalyptic clash that ultimately results in the revelation of her inhuman activities to the Harvard community and the police (events 25-29).\n\n### 2. Describe the protagonist's state and how it changed at each event\n\n- **Event 1 (Discovery of eerie parallels):** John starts to feel a sense of unease and curiosity about Liz's activities. His state changes from being confident in his relationship and professional life to being slightly unsettled and inquisitive.\n- **Event 2 (Discovery of the sinister lab):** John's unease deepens into fear and suspicion. His state deteriorates as he begins to question Liz's integrity and the nature of their relationship.\n- **Event 3 (Realization of student disappearances):** John's fear turns into alarm and desperation. His state worsens as he struggles to connect the dots between the disappearances and Liz's activities, feeling overwhelmed by the implications.\n- **Event 4 (Discovery of the truth about Liz):** John's world is shattered. His state hits a low point as he grapples with the horrific truth about the woman he loves, feeling betrayed, shocked, and dismayed.\n- **Event 5 (Confrontation with Liz and its aftermath):** John, though emotionally battered, finds the strength to stand up against Liz and expose her crimes. His state improves slightly as he takes action, but he remains emotionally wounded. The confrontation and subsequent validation of his claims by the police investigation mark a turning point where John begins to recover and find justice, albeit at a great personal cost.\n\n### 3. Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain the reasoning\n\nThe story arc can be classified based on how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the narrative. Initially, John is in a high state, being a renowned professor with a promising relationship. However, as the story progresses, he falls into a deep dilemma upon discovering the truth about Liz and her horrific deeds. This downfall is marked by his emotional turmoil, fear, and the shattering of his personal and professional life. \n\nAfter hitting this low point, John begins to recover by taking action against Liz, which leads to her downfall and the exposure of her crimes. This act of standing up against her and seeking justice can be seen as a recovery phase where John's condition starts to improve. However, the story also hints at a subsequent challenge or potential downfall with the introduction of the new drama professor, whose style eerily mirrors Liz's, suggesting that the cycle of horror might not be fully broken.\n\nGiven these elements, the story seems to follow a pattern where the protagonist starts high, falls into a deep crisis, recovers to some extent by taking action, but then faces the possibility of another significant challenge or downfall. This pattern aligns with the **Oedipus** story arc type, which is characterized by a protagonist who starts in a high position, falls, recovers, and then faces another significant downfall or challenge.\n\n### 4.

journey is abruptly brought to a grinding halt.\n9) The instigator is a surprise coup led by the relentless Colonel Yuri Spalko, spearheading the vicious Russian forces.\n10) This unfortunate detention sets in motion a series of unexpected findings, including their confinement within the malevolently designed \u201cThe Fortress of the Iron Curtain,\u201d a secretive Russian stronghold.\n11) Encased within the stifling walls of the fortress, they discover a tormented Dr. Lombard.\n12) The captive scientist reveals his breakthrough research, a weapon of unprecedented potency that could disrupt the balance of the Cold War if utilized maliciously.\n13) This revelation dials up the anxiety, prompting Charlie and Mac to devise a plan to escape their current predicament, especially upon understanding the catastrophic potential the weapon possesses.\n14) Simultaneously, they discreetly observe the routines of the fortress guards, map out the architecture of the stronghold, and study the layered security system, strategizing potential routes to their escape.\n15) Back in Washington, anxiety skyrockets as news of their disappearance permeates the international sphere, further fueling the tensions simmering between the nations.\n16) In a risky maneuver, the CIA initiates covert discussions with the Russian government in an attempt to negotiate

ominously behind the fleeing trio.\n24) Using their battlefield experience, the trio manages to dodge deadly traps, escape ruthless patrols, and progress hastily towards their extraction point, as they strive to stay one step ahead Spalko's advancing forces.\n25) A combat rife with adrenaline ensues as Charlie hangs precariously from the rear cargo ramp of the life-bearing chopper, dispensing suppressive fire to provide protective cover.\n26) Amidst the high-octane chaos, Mac hoists a semi-conscious Dr. Lombard into the hovering chopper, braving the hail of bullets to prioritize Lombard's safety.\n27) Drawing from his reservoir of survival skills, Charlie manages to hold off the remaining threats, compellingly making his way onto the aircraft amidst a shower of spent bullet casings.\n28) With the ground cleared, the chopper roars off, a symbol of heroic victory against a swarm of adversities.\n29) Upon touching down on home soil, the visibly shaken Dr. Lombard, along with the secured weapon blueprints, are promptly whisked away by the waiting CIA agents.\n30) The relieved officials ensure that Dr. Lombard is immediately provided medical care, and the terrifying

        "output": "### Task 1: Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\n\nThe protagonists in the story are Charlie Warden and Mac Johnston, two seasoned World War II veterans. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. The arrival of an unknown agent from one of the CIA's hidden branches, bringing news about Dr. Richard Lombard's disappearance (sentence 3).\n2. The surprise coup led by Colonel Yuri Spalko, resulting in Charlie and Mac's detention (sentence 9).\n3. The discovery of Dr. Lombard within the \"Fortress of the Iron Curtain\" and learning about his revolutionary weapon blueprints (sentence 11).\n4. The successful escape from the fortress, securing the confidential blueprints and freeing Dr. Lombard (sentence 18).\n5. The final extraction, where Charlie, Mac, and Dr. Lombard are rescued and the weapon blueprints are secured, marking the end of their mission (sentences 25-28).\n\n### Task 2: Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **Initial Event (Arrival of the CIA Agent):** Charlie and Mac are in a state of peaceful retirement, enjoying their lives after the chaos of World War II. The news brings uncertainty and a call to action, slightly disrupting their tranquility.\n\n2. **Detention by Colonel Spalko:** The protagonists' state worsens significantly as they are captured and confined within the fortress. This is a low point, filled with danger and uncertainty.\n\n3. **Discovery of Dr. Lombard and the Weapon Blueprints:** While still in a precarious situation, Charlie and Mac gain valuable information and a clear mission objective, which gives them a sense of purpose. However, their physical state remains captive and at risk.\n\n4. **Escape from the Fortress:** This marks a significant improvement in their state as they regain freedom, secure the blueprints, and rescue Dr. Lombard. It's a turning point where they move from captivity to action, taking control of their situation.\n\n5. **Final Extraction:** The protagonists successfully complete their mission, ensuring the security of the weapon blueprints and Dr. Lombard's safety. They return home, hailed as heroes internally within the CIA, though they choose to remain anonymous. This is a high point, where they have overcome challenges and achieved their goals, returning to a peaceful life.\n\n### Task 3: Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, it starts with Charlie and Mac in a peaceful retirement (a relatively high state), then faces a significant challenge and danger (low point) upon their detention, and finally achieves success and returns home (high point) after their daring escape and mission completion. This pattern follows a protagonist falling into a dilemma (being detained and tasked with a dangerous mission) and then finding a way out, ending better than at the beginning (successfully completing the mission and returning home safely).\n\nThe story arc type that best fits this description is the \"Man in a Hole\" arc, as the protagonists face a significant downfall (capture and danger) but then recover and overcome their challenges, ending in a better or at least a victorious state compared to their initial situation.\n\n### Task 4: Determined Story Arc Type\n\nMan in a Hole"

the decaying Wain empire.\n22) Slowly, he regained respect from business peers and vying competitors, his tangible actions reinstating faith in the resilient Wain heritage, steadily thriving under his wise leadership.\n23) Despite damaged by his father's dishonourable actions, Charles chose transparency over cover-ups when addressing his employees and associates.\n24) In the ensuing climax, Charles\u2019 true leadership strength was put to the fore, shining brilliantly.\n25) Sound agreements hammered out in oak-panelled boardrooms and legal victories marked the beginning of a new era for the Wain family.\n26) Charles, realizing that leadership wasn't merely about displaying power but about demonstrating care and responsibility, assumed his role with a renewed perspective.\n27) The closing scene illustrated Charles within the ambit of their century-old family estate, his firm yet empathetic leadership serving as a rock-solid protection for the Wain name.\n28) Charles had reshaped the Wain trajectory towards a stable path, vowing for a future characterized by accountability and decency rather than maintaining pretences.\n29) The narrative ends with Charles, now hardened with life's robust lessons, carrying out his patriarchal responsibilities with diligence and honour.\n30) As Charles gazed over the sprawling Wainhouse estate towards the setting sun, he fully comprehended his transformation from an unseasoned heir to a mature, respected patriarch.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better (e.g.,

Charles begins with a loss (his father's death), faces numerous challenges (managing the company, Winston's claim, discovering his father's secrets), but through his actions and determination, he not only overcomes these challenges but also grows as a character, leading to a more positive outcome (successfully confronting Winston, rebuilding the company, and assuming his role with renewed perspective).\n\nThis pattern aligns with the **Man in a Hole** story arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma but finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning. The key characteristic of this arc is the protagonist's ability to overcome adversity and emerge stronger and more resilient, which is evident in Charles's transformation from an unseasoned heir to a mature, respected patriarch.\n\n### Determined Story Arc Type\n\nMan in a Hole"

        "output": "To classify the story arc type, let's first identify the protagonist and major events in the story.\n\n1. **Identify the protagonist and major events:**\n   - The protagonist of the story is not clearly a single character throughout but seems to focus on the community of Oak Springs, particularly characters like Lupita, Dolores, and Caleb, who are central to the unfolding events. For the purpose of analysis, we'll consider Lupita as a key character whose state we can track throughout the story.\n   - Major events:\n     1. Mario's death and the transformation of the bingo hall into a casino under Mr. Big's management.\n     2. The community's initial success and winnings at the casino, notably Dolores's daughter-in-law Raquel and later Clarence.\n     3. The realization that something is terribly wrong, as characters start to suffer bizarre and fatal accidents, such as Clarence's death.\n     4. Lupita's discovery of the truth and her attempt to rescue the community, including finding Clarence's body and seeing Morris's interaction with Mr. Big.\n     5. The final confrontation where Lupita, Caleb, and the community fight back against Mr. Big, leading to his demise and their escape.\n\n2. **Describe the protagonist's state and changes:**\n   - **Event 1:** At the beginning, Lupita is introduced as part of the community, seemingly living a normal life. Her state is neutral or even positive.\n   - **Event 2:** As the community starts winning at the casino, Lupita's state, by association, seems to improve. The community is excited and benefiting from the new establishment.\n   - **Event 3:** With the bizarre accidents and deaths, Lupita's state deteriorates. She becomes aware of the sinister forces at play and starts to investigate, indicating a decline in her well-being and safety.\n   - **Event 4:** Lupita's discovery of the truth about Mr. Big and the casino's influence over the community puts her in a state of urgency and danger. Her condition worsens as she realizes the extent of the problem.\n   - **Event 5:** In the final confrontation, Lupita's state improves as she and the community successfully defeat Mr. Big, escaping his control and the casino's influence. This indicates a recovery from the previous low point.\n\n3. **Classify the story arc type:**\n   - Given the protagonist's (Lupita's) condition throughout the story, we see an initial neutral or positive state, followed by a temporary improvement, then a significant decline as the sinister nature of the casino is revealed and the community suffers, and finally, an improvement as the community fights back and prevails.\n   - This pattern does not fit the **Rags to Riches** arc, as the improvement is not linear and faces significant setbacks.\n   - It doesn't fit **Riches to Rags** either, as the story does not end with the protagonist in a significantly lower state than the beginning.\n   - The **Man in a Hole** arc is closer, as Lupita falls into a dilemma (discovering the sinister forces and their impact on the community) and finds a way out (defeating Mr. Big and freeing the community).\n   - The story also has elements of **Cinderella**, with a rise (initial success at the casino), a setback (realization of the danger and tragic events), and ultimately achieving a higher state (freedom from Mr. Big's control).\n\n4. **Determined story arc type:**\n   - **Man in a Hole**"

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Curt Goynes, a gangster in need of cash. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Event 1: Recruitment** - Curt Goynes is recruited for a blackmail scheme (sentence 1).\n2. **Event 2: The Hostage Situation** - Goynes, along with others, holds a family hostage as part of the scheme, leading to the death of Charley (sentences 2-4).\n3. **Event 3: The Discovery of the Fake Documents** - Jones discovers the documents retrieved by Wertz are fake, leading to a new set of instructions for Goynes (sentences 5-6).\n4. **Event 4: The Retrieval of the Real Document** - Goynes, Russo, and Wertz retrieve the real document, which turns out to be plans for a new car part (sentence 9).\n5. **Event 5: The Final Resolution** - Goynes resolves his situation with Watkins, receiving the $5,000 he originally sought and leaving for Kansas City (sentences 30-31).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **At Event 1 (Recruitment):** Goynes is in a disadvantaged situation, needing cash to leave town. His condition is low.\n- **At Event 2 (The Hostage Situation):** Goynes's condition improves slightly as he takes control by killing Charley and protecting the family, showing a moral compass and initiative.\n- **At Event 3 (The Discovery of the Fake Documents):** Goynes's condition worsens as he is ordered to kill Russo and the family, realizing he and Russo have been set up. This is a significant downturn.\n- **At Event 4 (The Retrieval of the Real Document):** Goynes's condition improves as he successfully retrieves the document and starts making plans to sell it, potentially gaining financially and resolving his initial need for cash.\n- **At Event 5 (The Final Resolution):** Goynes's condition ends on a high note relative to his starting point. He resolves his conflicts, receives the money he initially sought, and is able to leave for Kansas City, achieving a form of freedom and resolution to his initial problem.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the story. Given the fluctuations in Goynes's situation, from a low point of needing cash and being in dangerous situations, to moments of control and initiative, and finally to resolving his situation and achieving a form of success and freedom, the story exhibits characteristics of a \"Double Man in a Hole\" arc. This is because Goynes faces at least two significant cycles of dilemma (being in a bad situation) and recovery (improving his situation). The first cycle involves the initial recruitment and the complications arising from the hostage situation and the discovery of the fake documents. The second cycle involves the retrieval of the real document and the subsequent negotiations and dangers associated with selling it, culminating in his final resolution with Watkins and his departure.\n\nThe \"Double Man in a Hole\" arc fits because Goynes's story involves more than one significant downturn (being set up, facing danger) followed by recovery (resolving the situation, achieving financial gain, and personal resolution). This pattern of falling into a dilemma and then finding a way out, repeated over the course of the story, aligns with the characteristics of the \"Double Man in a Hole\" story arc.\n\n### 4.

Describe the protagonist's state at each event and how it changed\n\n- **Event 1 (Jacob's arrival):** Maria's state is one of solitude and isolation, with a hint of mystery surrounding her past. Her condition is static at this point, as Jacob's arrival has not yet impacted her.\n- **Event 2 (Initial attempts at friendship):** Maria is hesitant and guarded, indicating her state is still one of isolation, but there's a slight crack in her defenses due to Jacob's approach. Her condition is slightly more open but still cautious.\n- **Event 3 (Erosion of defenses):** Maria's state begins to shift more significantly as she starts to open up to Jacob. Her condition improves as she begins to form a connection, moving from isolation towards friendship.\n- **Event 4 (Sharing her past):** Maria's state is one of vulnerability but also of liberation. By sharing her painful experiences, she transcends her guilt and inhibitions, marking a significant improvement in her emotional state.

This pattern matches the \"Rags to Riches\" story arc, where the protagonist's condition improves from the start to the end of the story. The key characteristic of this arc is the upward trajectory of the protagonist's fortunes or emotional state, which is evident in Maria's journey from isolation and pain to connection and peace.\n\n### 4.

The car accident that leads to Matilda's temporary death and revival (sentence 3).\n2. The discovery that people are no longer able to fall asleep, and the exception of an old woman being studied at The Hub (sentences 7-9).\n3.

Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **First Event (Car Accident):** Jill's state changes from a struggling single mother and addict to someone facing a life-threatening crisis with her children. Her condition worsens as she fears for her children's lives.\n\n2. **Second Event (Discovery of Sleep Disorder):** Jill's state becomes one of desperation and concern for her family's well-being as they, like everyone else, cannot sleep. Her condition worsens due to the sleep deprivation and the chaos it causes.\n\n3. **Third Event (Escape from Church):** Jill's state improves slightly as she manages to rescue Matilda from the churchgoers, showing her ability to protect her family in extreme situations. However, the overall danger and uncertainty of their situation keep her condition precarious.\n\n4. **Fourth Event (Revelation at The Hub):** Jill's state worsens as she learns there is no cure for the sleep disorder, and she sees the desperation and cruelty that humanity is capable of in the face of disaster. The decision to study Matilda puts Jill in a position of helplessness and fear for her daughter's safety.\n\n5. **Fifth Event (Final Rescue and Revival):** Jill's state reaches its lowest point physically and emotionally as she is exhausted, experiences delirium, and faces the loss of her son.

Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc of Jill Adams can be classified by examining the changes in her condition throughout the narrative. Initially, Jill faces significant challenges as a recovering addict and a single mother, indicating a low starting point. The car accident and the subsequent sleep disorder affecting everyone push her into an even more desperate situation, marking a further decline. However, her ability to protect her family and navigate the dangerous new world shows moments of improvement, albeit temporary. The revelation of no cure and the dangers at The Hub plunge her into deeper distress. Finally, the rescue of her children and her own revival offer a significant improvement in her condition, especially considering the possibility of regaining the ability to sleep.\n\nGiven these fluctuations, where Jill faces multiple dilemmas (the accident, the sleep disorder, the threat to Matilda, and her own physical and emotional exhaustion) and then finds a way out of these crises (rescuing Matilda, the potential cure through temporary death), the story best fits the \"Double Man in a Hole\" arc. This classification is due to the protagonist experiencing two significant cycles of falling into a dilemma and then recovering, with each cycle representing a major challenge and subsequent escape or improvement.\n\n### 4.

Cal discovers Jack's sketch of Rose and accuses him of theft, leading to Jack's arrest, which puts Rose in a difficult situation where she must choose between her loyalty to Cal and her feelings for Jack (sentence 19).\n4. Rose decides to rescue Jack from his imprisonment, showing her commitment to him and her willingness to defy societal expectations (sentence 23).\n5. Jack dies in the ocean after helping Rose onto a wooden panel, leaving Rose alone but alive (sentence 35).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (sentence 7):** Rose is distraught and feeling trapped in her engagement, considering suicide as an escape. Her state is one of desperation and hopelessness.\n- **Event 2 (sentence 14):** Rose's state has improved as she has found a connection with Jack, offering her a sense of freedom and happiness she hadn't experienced before. This marks a positive turn in her emotional state.\n- **Event 3 (sentence 19):** Rose's situation becomes complicated again as she is forced to confront the consequences of her relationship with Jack, now that Cal is aware of it. Her state is one of anxiety and conflict.\n- **Event 4 (sentence 23):** Rose takes action to rescue Jack, showing determination and courage. Her state has shifted towards empowerment and love, as she prioritizes her feelings for Jack over her obligations to Cal.\n- **Event 5 (sentence 35):** After Jack's death, Rose is left in a state of grief and loss. However, she is also alive and has the opportunity to rebuild her life, inspired by her experiences with Jack.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, the narrative does not fit neatly into a simple \"Riches to Rags\" category as initially classified. Instead, Rose's journey involves a transformation from a state of despair and entrapment to one of empowerment and eventual loss, but with a lasting positive impact on her life. \n\nThe story begins with Rose in a metaphorical \"hole\" due to her unwanted engagement and societal pressures. She then experiences a rise as she finds love and freedom with Jack, which represents an improvement in her condition. However, this is followed by a tragic downfall with Jack's death, leaving her in a state of grief. Despite this, the story concludes on a hopeful note, with Rose having been inspired by her time with Jack and implied to have lived a fulfilling life thereafter.\n\nThis pattern more closely aligns with a narrative where the protagonist faces challenges, rises above them, suffers a setback, but ultimately achieves a form of redemption or closure. Given the provided story arc types, the closest match would be the \"Cinderella\" story arc, which involves a rise, a setback, and ultimately achieving a higher state, though the traditional \"Cinderella\" arc typically ends on a more overtly positive note.\n\nHowever, considering the complexity of Rose's journey and the emphasis on her personal growth and the bittersweet nature of her story, it might also be argued to resemble aspects of other story arcs, such as \"Man in a Hole\" due to her initial desperation and subsequent rescue through her relationship with Jack, followed by her resilience in the face of tragedy.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Abby Holland. Here are 5 major events in the story:\n\n1. Abby agrees to pretend to be Harper's heterosexual roommate for the holiday (Event 5).\n2. Abby meets Harper's exes and begins questioning how much she knows about her girlfriend (Event 8).\n3. Abby is labeled a shoplifter and Ted and Tipper think it might be better if they keep her away from upcoming social events (Event 11).\n4. Sloane outs Harper as a lesbian at the Christmas Eve party, leading to a public confrontation (Event 16).\n5. Harper confirms to her parents that she is a lesbian and later apologizes to Abby, leading to their reconciliation (Events 19-22).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Agreeing to Pretend):** Abby's state is one of compromise and uncertainty. She agrees to pretend to be Harper's roommate, which already puts her in an uncomfortable position, indicating a slight decline in her emotional state due to the deception and uncertainty about how Harper's family will react.\n- **Event 2 (Meeting Harper's Exes):** Abby's state worsens as she feels more out of place and uncertain about her relationship with Harper. Meeting the exes and seeing the competitive relationship between Harper and her sister makes Abby question the depth of her connection with Harper, leading to a decrease in her emotional well-being.\n- **Event 3 (Labeled a Shoplifter):** Abby's state hits a low point. Being accused of shoplifting and facing potential social exclusion by Ted and Tipper makes her feel like an outsider and increases her feelings of discomfort and rejection, further lowering her emotional state.\n- **Event 4 (Public Confrontation):** Abby's state remains low due to the public outing of Harper's sexuality and the ensuing conflict. This event, while significant for Harper, leaves Abby feeling heartbroken and uncertain about their future together, maintaining her low emotional state.\n- **Event 5 (Reconciliation):** Abby's state improves significantly. After Harper's apology and confession of love, Abby forgives her, and they reconcile. This event marks a turnaround in Abby's emotional state, as she moves from feelings of uncertainty and heartbreak to acceptance and love, indicating an improvement in her condition.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, it can be observed that Abby starts in a relatively good place (in a relationship, planning to propose), faces a series of challenges and setbacks (pretending to be someone she's not, feeling like an outsider, public confrontation), and then ends in a better state than where she began (reconciled with Harper, with a deeper understanding and commitment). This pattern of rising, facing a setback, and ultimately achieving a higher state aligns with the **Cinderella** story arc type. The Cinderella arc is characterized by the protagonist overcoming adversity to achieve a happier ending, which is evident in Abby's journey from feeling like an outsider and facing relationship challenges to ultimately finding acceptance and love.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Sarah Thompson, a U.S. Army soldier. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Introduction to Sarah's War Experience**: The story begins with Sarah in the midst of a ferocious firefight in Afghanistan, showcasing her skills and determination as a soldier (sentences 1-5).\n2. **Struggling with PTSD and Addiction**: After the war, Sarah is shown struggling with PTSD and addiction to painkillers in her civilian life in Chicago (sentences 6-12).\n3. **Joining Blackhawk Solutions**: Sarah joins a private security firm, Blackhawk Solutions, after her circumstances become desperate, offering her a new path and challenges (sentences 13-19).\n4. **Discovering the Conspiracy**: Sarah discovers a conspiracy within Blackhawk Solutions to stage a coup in a Middle Eastern government, leading to a moral crisis and decision to act against the firm (sentences 23-28).\n5. **Final Confrontation and Escape**: Sarah executes her plan to thwart the coup, faces numerous challenges, and ultimately fakes her own death to escape her pursuers, leading to a life on the run (sentences 33-40).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Sarah is depicted as strong, skilled, and determined in a war zone. Her state is one of control and proficiency.\n- **Event 2**: Sarah's state deteriorates as she struggles with PTSD and addiction, showing a significant decline from her previous state of strength and control.\n- **Event 3**: By joining Blackhawk Solutions, Sarah begins to rebuild her life, showing improvement from her previous struggling state. She starts to manage her tasks and shows a professional approach, indicating a rise in her condition.\n- **Event 4**: The discovery of the conspiracy leads to a moral and ethical dilemma for Sarah, causing internal conflict and a potential decline in her state as she grapples with what to do.\n- **Event 5**: Sarah's decision to act against the conspiracy and her subsequent actions lead to a dangerous and uncertain outcome. While she succeeds in thwarting the coup and escapes, her life becomes more precarious, and she is forced into hiding. This could be seen as a mixed outcome - she achieves her goal but at a significant personal cost, leading to a state of constant vigilance and danger.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the progression of Sarah's state throughout the story, it starts with her in a position of strength and skill, then declines significantly as she faces personal demons, rises as she finds a new path and purpose, but ultimately ends in a state of danger and uncertainty after making a stand against the conspiracy. This pattern reflects a story arc where the protagonist rises to a challenge, faces a significant setback, and then experiences a dramatic fall or significant change in circumstances.\n\nThe initial classification provided is **Icarus**, which typically involves a protagonist rising to success but then facing a drastic downfall. However, considering Sarah's journey from a state of strength, to a low point, to a rise, and then to a final state of uncertainty and danger, it seems more aligned with a story arc that involves a rise, a fall, and then another significant challenge or change.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Alex, a jovial and quick-witted man from Mentone, a humble Georgian village. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. Sophia's arrival in Mentone with her ruby-red Ferrari (sentence 4).\n2. Alex decides to use Sophia's Ferrari for rip-roaring rides around the countryside, disregarding her meticulous guidelines (sentence 14).\n3. Alex experiences a pang of guilt and anxiety over the damage inflicted on Sophia's Ferrari and attempts to repair it (sentences 16 and 25).\n4. The whole village comes together to help Alex fix the luxury vehicle before Sophia's return (sentence 26).\n5. Sophia returns, and after initial disappointment, she understands and appreciates the efforts made by Alex and the village, deciding to stay in Mentone (sentences 29-34).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **Sophia's arrival**: Alex is in a state of curiosity and excitement, seeing an opportunity to work on a luxury car, which is a deviation from his usual tasks. His state is positive, filled with anticipation.\n\n2. **Using Sophia's Ferrari for rides**: Alex's state changes to one of excitement and mischief as he enjoys the thrill of driving the Ferrari. However, this action also sets the stage for future complications.\n\n3. **Experiencing guilt and attempting repairs**: Alex's state shifts to one of guilt and anxiety. He is faced with the dilemma of confessing his actions to Sophia and dealing with the consequences of damaging her property. His condition has worsened compared to the previous event.\n\n4. **Village helping to fix the Ferrari**: Alex's state remains anxious but also hopeful as he involves the village in fixing the car. There's a sense of community and support, which slightly improves his condition but still keeps him in a challenging situation.\n\n5. **Sophia's return and decision to stay**: Alex's state significantly improves as Sophia not only forgives him but also decides to leave her city life behind and stay in Mentone. This outcome is better than his initial state, as he has not only resolved his dilemma but also found love and a deeper connection with his community.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, the narrative follows a pattern where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (using Sophia's Ferrari without permission and damaging it) and then finds a way out of this situation (with the help of the village and Sophia's eventual understanding and love). Initially, Alex is in a good state, then his condition worsens as he faces the consequences of his actions, but ultimately, his state improves significantly as he resolves the dilemma and achieves a higher level of happiness and fulfillment.\n\nThis pattern aligns with the **Man in a Hole** story arc type, where the protagonist's condition improves from the first turning point to the last turning point, after falling into a hole or dilemma. The story shows Alex facing a problem, struggling with it, and then overcoming it to end up in a better situation than where he started.\n\n### 4. Determined Story Arc Type\n\nMan in a Hole"

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\n\nThe protagonist in this story is not a single character but rather a collective of the main characters, including John, Violet, and Billy, who are at the forefront of the efforts to reclaim their village's spirit and festival from Herbert Dippleton's control. However, if we are to consider a single character whose transformation is pivotal to the story's resolution, it would be Herbert Dippleton, the eccentric billionaire.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Introduction of Herbert Dippleton and his stifling laws**: Herbert introduces a series of laws that dampen the spirit of the Raspberry Festival and the village.\n2. **The formation of an alliance among John, Violet, and Billy to counter Herbert's influence**: The trio begins devising plans to seize control of their beloved festival back from Herbert.\n3. **The dismantling of Herbert's CCTV network and the ensuing chaos**: The villagers' plans start to unfold, leading to humorous misadventures and a significant challenge to Herbert's control.\n4. **The climax of the festival where Herbert's facade begins to crack**: Herbert is exposed to the villagers' true spirit, and his aloofness begins to break down, revealing a deep-seated loneliness.\n5. **The final acceptance and transformation of Herbert**: Herbert opens up to the villagers, invites them into his castle, and symbolically marks a new chapter of unity and friendship in Berrywood.\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **Introduction of Herbert Dippleton and his stifling laws**: Herbert is in a position of power but emotionally isolated. His condition is one of detachment and control.\n2. **The formation of an alliance among John, Violet, and Billy to counter Herbert's influence**: This event doesn't directly change Herbert's state but sets the stage for challenges to his authority. He remains detached but is about to face opposition.\n3. **The dismantling of Herbert's CCTV network and the ensuing chaos**: Herbert's control is challenged, but his emotional state remains largely unchanged. He's still isolated but perhaps slightly perturbed.\n4. **The climax of the festival where Herbert's facade begins to crack**: Herbert's emotional state begins to shift as he's exposed to the warmth and community of the villagers. His loneliness is highlighted, and his detachment starts to break down.\n5. **The final acceptance and transformation of Herbert**: Herbert undergoes a significant transformation, moving from isolation to connection. He opens up, accepts the villagers, and finds a sense of belonging and unity.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven Herbert's journey, his story arc can be classified based on his transformation from a state of isolation and control to one of connection and unity. Initially, Herbert is in a state of emotional poverty (or \"rags\") due to his loneliness and detachment. As the story progresses, he faces challenges to his authority but doesn't immediately change. However, through his exposure to the villagers' warmth and community, he begins to transform, ultimately ending in a much better state (\"riches\") of emotional connection and acceptance.\n\nThis transformation does not follow a simple \"Rags to Riches\" arc because Herbert's journey involves a significant downfall of his previous persona and a rebuilding into a new, more connected individual. It's more aligned with a transformative journey where the protagonist faces a dilemma (his isolation and the challenge to his control), falls deeper into it (as his loneliness is exposed), and then finds a way out (through his acceptance and transformation).\n\nHowever, considering the provided story arc types and focusing on Herbert's transformation, the closest match seems to be the \"Cinderella\" arc, where the protagonist rises (Herbert's initial power and control), faces a setback (the challenge to his authority and exposure of his loneliness), and ultimately achieves a higher state (his transformation and acceptance by the villagers).\n\n### 4.

        "output": "## Step 1: Identify the protagonist and 5 major events in the story.\nThe protagonist of the story is Leslie, a troubled and manipulative alcoholic. Five major events in the story are:\n1. Leslie reunites with her estranged 19-year-old son James and starts living with him (event 3).\n2. Leslie is given a chance to work at a motel by Sweeney in exchange for a small wage and boarding (event 9).\n3. Leslie attempts to focus on her job and maintain sobriety as she suffers through alcohol withdrawal (event 15).\n4. Leslie quits her job at the motel after a confrontation with Nancy and watching a VHS tape of her past (events 18 and 21).\n5. Leslie decides to renovate an abandoned ice cream shop into a diner with Sweeney's help and eventually opens it (events 28-30).\n\n## Step 2: Describe the protagonist's state and how it changed relative to the previous events at each major event.\n1. At the first event, Leslie's state improves as she reunites with her son and has a place to live, showing a potential for change and stability.\n2. At the second event, Leslie's state improves further as she gets a job and a place to stay, indicating a move towards responsibility and recovery.\n3. At the third event, Leslie's state is challenging as she struggles with alcohol withdrawal, but she is making an effort to change, showing determination and a will to improve.\n4. At the fourth event, Leslie's state worsens as she quits her job and faces confrontation, indicating a setback in her recovery and personal growth.\n5. At the fifth event, Leslie's state improves significantly as she finds a new purpose in opening a diner and is sober, showing a successful recovery and personal growth.\n\n## Step 3: Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain the reasoning.\nThe story arc type can be classified based on how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the story. Given the improvements and setbacks Leslie faces, the story seems to follow a pattern where the protagonist rises, faces a setback, and ultimately achieves a higher state. This pattern is characteristic of the Cinderella story arc type, where despite facing challenges and setbacks, the protagonist ultimately ends up in a better condition than at the start.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the story arc type.\nCinderella"

Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Kicked out of her sister's garage):** Liza's state is one of desperation and struggle, living in precarious conditions with her epileptic daughter.\n- **Event 2 (Lands a job at Zanna):** Liza's state improves significantly as she gains employment and a potential path out of poverty.\n- **Event 3 (Successfully convinces a physician to prescribe Lonafen):** Liza's state reaches a high point professionally, as she achieves success in her role and gains recognition.\n- **Event 4 (Decides to testify against Zanna):** Liza's state takes a turn for the worse morally and professionally, as she acknowledges her involvement in illegal activities and decides to cooperate with the authorities, risking her freedom.\n- **Event 5 (Sentenced to prison but later released and starts a new business):** Liza's state initially hits a low point with her imprisonment, a consequence of her past actions. However, upon release, she begins to rebuild her life, indicating a potential for recovery and redemption.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc of Liza Drake follows a pattern where she starts in a disadvantaged situation, rises to success, but then faces a drastic downfall due to her involvement in illegal activities. Her condition starts low, rises to a peak as she finds professional success, and then falls to a low point as she faces legal consequences. This pattern matches the **Icarus** story arc, where the protagonist's rise to success is followed by a significant downfall. The key characteristic of the Icarus arc is the protagonist's ascent to a peak, followed by a decline, which is clearly observed in Liza's journey from a struggling single mother to a successful salesperson and then to a convicted felon.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To analyze the story arc of the given narrative, let's follow the instructions step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the protagonist and 5 major events in the story:**\n   - The protagonist of the story is Batman.\n   - Five major events in the story are:\n     1. The Joker interrupts the mob bosses' meeting and offers to kill Batman for half their money (sentence 6).\n     2. Batman captures Lau and delivers him back to Gotham to testify against the Joker and the mob (sentence 9).\n     3. The Joker kills Rachel and scars half of Dent's face, leading to a significant downfall for the protagonists (sentence 19).\n     4. The Joker rigs two ferries with explosives, giving the passengers a choice to blow the other up, but they ultimately refuse (sentence 28-30).\n     5. Batman confronts Dent, who has turned into a villain, and saves Gordon's son but decides to take the blame for Dent's crimes to preserve hope in Gotham (sentences 36-40).\n\n2. **Describe the protagonist's state and how it changed relative to the previous events:**\n   - At the first event (sentence 6), Batman's state is one of being targeted by the Joker, but he is still in control and working to apprehend the Joker. This is a challenging situation but not a low point.\n   - By the second event (sentence 9), Batman has gained the upper hand by capturing Lau, which is a positive development in his quest against the Joker and the mob.\n   - The third event (sentence 19) marks a significant low point for Batman, as the Joker succeeds in killing Rachel and disfiguring Dent, leading to a moral and emotional downturn.\n   - At the fourth event (sentences 28-30), while the situation is dire, Batman's efforts and the moral integrity of the ferry passengers prevent a catastrophe, which can be seen as a recovery or a moment of hope.\n   - The fifth event (sentences 36-40) shows Batman facing another low point, as he must confront the corrupted Dent and make a difficult choice to take the blame for Dent's actions to protect Gotham's hope. However, he also manages to save Gordon's son, which is a positive outcome.\n\n3. **Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain your reasoning:**\n   - The story starts with Batman in a position of being challenged by the Joker but still in control. He then faces a series of setbacks, including the failure to protect Rachel and Dent's corruption, which leads to a significant low point. However, through his actions and the resilience of the people of Gotham, there are moments of recovery and hope. Ultimately, Batman ends up in a sacrificial position, taking the blame for Dent's actions to maintain hope in Gotham, which is a complex mix of a low point and a noble act.\n   - Given these developments, the story arc does not fit neatly into a simple \"Rags to Riches\" or \"Riches to Rags\" pattern. Instead, it involves a cycle of challenge, downfall, and recovery, with the protagonist ultimately making a significant sacrifice for the greater good.\n   - The \"Man in a Hole\" story arc is characterized by the protagonist falling into a dilemma and then finding a way out, ending better than at the beginning. While Batman does face and overcome challenges, his final state is more complex, involving a personal sacrifice that, while noble, does not necessarily leave him in a better condition than when he started.\n\n4. **Determined story arc type:**\nMan in a Hole"

from an old work colleague, Queenie Hennessy, reveals she is dying from cancer and is living in a hospice in Berwick-upon-Tweed.\n3) Penning a perfunctory response, he complains that the words he has written are not enough of a response but, lacking ideas, he goes to post them anyway.\n4) Finding himself still reluctant to release the letter he continues walking into town, passing multiple opportunities to send the letter, before finding himself in a petrol garage where the attendant tells him that her support helped her aunt fight back against her own cancer.\n5) Inspired, he calls the hospice and asks them to tell Queenie that he intends to walk to Berwick - some 500 miles - and she must hold onto her life until he arrives.\n6) Realising Harold is not returning, Maureen is at first worried, then when he calls her to inform her of his plan, she reacts angrily.\n7) Eventually, she reveals to her neighbour Rex that following several years of rocky relationship, she fears he has taken the opportunity to finally walk out on their marriage - something she admits she had almost done numerous times in the past.\n8) After several days of travel, Harold begins to suffer flashbacks and hallucinations of his son, David.\n9) Suffering a tempestuous relationship, in his early adult years David spurned Harold's parenting and their relationship broke down.\n10) After collapsing in the road, Harold is taken in by Martina, a Slovakian doctor who emigrated to the UK but is now unable to find any other work than cleaning.\n11) She treats his feet, which are now covered in sores and infected blisters, and allows him to recuperate in her house for several days.\n12) Meanwhile she reveals that her partner left her for another woman a year ago, and she still waits for him to return every day.\n13) Though Harold does not feel himself equal to her hospitality, she tells him that his story refusal to accept bitter truths lying down humbles her, and she sends him on his way with several pieces of walking kit left by her former partner.\n14) Harold's journey continues for several weeks, with Harold continuing to meet strangers and humble them with his selfless spirit.\n15) Stopping for a drink in a pub, one patron asks to take his picture as a keepsake.\n16) The photo makes its way to the media and he rapidly becomes a national sensation, though Harold has no knowledge of the story.\n17) Shortly after, Harold is joined by Wilf, an eighteen-year-old junkie who was inspired by his story and wants to walk to save Queenie too.\n18) As more media outlets pick up the story, several dozen more individuals join him and collectively adopt the moniker of 'Pilgrim', though Harold seems bemused by their presence and struggles to understand why they are fascinated by him.\n19) Maureen and Rex also travel up to visit Harold, though when Harold invites Maureen to join his walk she responds in frustration that she is unable to let go of the things holding her back in the way he has.\n20) The camp, though continuing to grow and fostering a genuine camaderie amongst the Pilgrims, slowly becomes something of a circus and is by now making barely any progress towards Berwick.\n21) Harold's memories of his son continue, and after Wilf flees the camp after being caught raiding Harold's supplies and carrying pills, Harold recalls David's own descent into drug-taking.\n22) In a discussion with another Pilgrim he tells her of how he watched his son deteriorate before he took his own life in their garage.\n23) The Pilgrim helps Harold to accept that he needs to leave the camp behind to reach his destination.\n24) Now alone, Harold's mental state declines as he fears the end of the journey will result in the same loss as he suffered with David, and he eventually phones Maureen from a phone booth to tell her that he has no idea where he is and that he wants to come home.\n25) Maureen, having had time to come to terms with her own feelings, instead informs him that he is only 18 miles from Berwick and that he must finish his journey.\n26) She also reveals to him that she never passed on Queenie's final message to him some 25 years earlier.\n27) Believing that he was to blame for David's death and the resulting near-collapse of his marriage, Harold had turned to drink and had determined to engineer ways of punishing himself further.\n28) He had therefore driven to his place of work at night and destroyed much of their stock, intending on being fired for his actions.\n29) Instead, Queenie had found him first and had taken the blame for the damage, being dismissed in his place but allowing him to rebuild his life.\n30) Some time later she had driven to Harold and Maureen's house while he was out to tell him that she was moving away and to tell him not to blame himself for everything that had come to pass.\n31) Maureen, feeling spiteful for the way that he was receiving comfort where she had none and perhaps suspecting an affair, had refused to pass on the message, but finally lets him hear it.\n32) Shortly afterwards, Harold reaches Berwick.\n33) He initially struggles to summon the nerve to enter the hospice but when he does, then he is enthusiastically greeted by the nun he has spoken to on the phone on several occasions, who leads him in to greet Queenie but warns him that she is no longer able to speak.\n34) Something of a taciturn man, Harold finds himself unable to say much to her but hangs up a quartz pendant that he has brought from near the start of his journey in her window.\n35) When meeting Maureen again in Berwick, Harold confesses defeat, implying that Queenie did not live long after his arrival and telling Maureen that he doesn't understand how he thought that he could save her when he could not save David.\n36) She responds by telling him that his devotion to Queenie has helped her remember the man she used to love and that his actions have saved their marriage.\n37) Meanwhile, the various people who Harold and his story touched along the pilgrimage are shown looking at light reflected around them, and smiling.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Harold Fry, a retired pensioner. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. Harold decides to walk to Berwick-upon-Tweed after receiving a letter from Queenie Hennessy, who is dying of cancer.\n2. Harold meets Martina, a Slovakian doctor, who helps him recover from his journey and shares her own story of heartbreak.\n3. Harold becomes a national sensation, and many people join him on his walk, adopting the moniker \"Pilgrim.\"\n4. Harold has a breakdown and calls Maureen, telling her he wants to come home, but she encourages him to finish his journey.\n5. Harold finally reaches Berwick-upon-Tweed and visits Queenie in the hospice.\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **Initial Decision to Walk**: Harold's state is one of inspiration and determination. He feels the need to do something for Queenie and decides on this extraordinary journey. This marks a significant change from his sedentary life, indicating an improvement in his condition as he takes action.\n\n2. **Meeting Martina**: Harold's physical state is poor due to the hardships of his journey, but meeting Martina improves his mental and physical condition. She helps him recover, and her story humbles him, showing that his selfless act has inspired others. This event further improves Harold's condition as he finds support and connection.\n\n3. **Becoming a National Sensation**: Harold's state is one of confusion and bemusement as he struggles to understand why so many people are drawn to his story and want to join him. While this brings him more support, it also introduces chaos and distraction from his original goal. His condition could be seen as plateauing or slightly declining due to the loss of focus on his personal journey.\n\n4. **Breakdown and Calling Maureen**: Harold's state is at its lowest. He is mentally and physically exhausted, fearing the outcome of his journey and feeling overwhelmed by the responsibility and attention. This marks a significant decline in his condition as he faces his deepest fears and feels lost.\n\n5. **Visiting Queenie**: Harold's state is one of sadness and acceptance. He finally reaches Queenie but finds her unable to speak. Despite the sadness, there's a sense of completion and fulfillment of his promise. His condition improves slightly from the low point of his breakdown, as he finds closure and learns valuable lessons about himself and his relationships.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the analysis, Harold starts in a relatively low state (sedentary life, troubled past), improves as he embarks on his journey and meets supportive people, faces a significant decline as he struggles with the consequences of his newfound fame and personal demons, and then slightly improves as he finds closure and learns from his experiences. This pattern resembles the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (Harold's breakdown and fears) and then finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning (Harold finds closure, and his actions positively impact his marriage).\n\n### 4.

rumors claim that the spirits torment any nurses and doctors who dare enter.\n4) Rowena has hired Joyce to commune with her daughter Alicia, who committed suicide after Alicia's fianc\u00e9, chef Maxime Gerard, ended their engagement.\n5) Among the guests are Rowena's housekeeper Olga Seminoff, Drake family doctor Leslie Ferrier and his son Leopold, and Joyce's Romani assistant Desdemona Holland; they are joined by Maxime right before the s\u00e9ance, and during it Poirot reveals Desdemona's half-brother Nicholas\u2014and Joyce's second assistant\u2014hiding in the chimney.\n6) Joyce suddenly speaks in Alicia's voice, saying that one of the guests murdered her.\n7) Poirot confronts Joyce, who insists he lighten up, gives him her mask and robe, and cryptically says they will not meet again.\n8) Seconds later, an unknown assailant nearly drowns Poirot when he is apple bobbing, while Joyce falls from an upper story and is impaled on a courtyard statue.\n9) With a storm cutting off the palazzo, Poirot interviews the guests, during which he witnesses manifestations of Alicia's ghost and hears a young girl humming a tune.\n10) The investigation yields perplexing results:   Leslie, severely traumatized by his experiences at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, is in love with Rowena.\n11) Maxime, who was not initially invited, ended his and Alicia's engagement because Rowena disapproved of him, and Alicia was obsessed with keeping her mother happy.\n12) Nicholas and Desdemona have been stealing from Joyce, intending to travel to St. Louis, Missouri, which they became enamoured with after partly seeing Meet Me in St. Louis at a displaced persons camp.\n13) Leopold claims to hear the same voice(s) Poirot has been hearing, a claim later also made by Leslie.When the guests discover an underground chamber containing children's skeletal remains and bees, Leslie suffers a panic attack and nearly kills Maxime.\n14) He is locked inside the music room to recover, Rowena giving Poirot the only key.\n15) After examining Maxime's invitation, Poirot deduces Ariadne sent it and is conspiring with Vitale: Vitale, who investigated Alicia's death and resigned from the police as a result of the case, gave Joyce private details, while Ariadne had hoped to use Poirot's inability to explain the supernatural as a plot for her next book.\n16) Leslie is then found dead with a knife in his back.\n17) Gathering the remaining guests, Poirot reveals Rowena caused the deaths of Alicia, Joyce, and Leslie, hoping to pass them off as part of the children's curse.\n18) Obsessed with keeping Alicia for herself, Rowena poisoned her with small doses of the honey of Rhododendron ponticum, weakening and then caring for a hallucinating Alicia (the same honey seemingly caused Poirot's visions) to isolate her from Maxime when they planned to reconcile; the night of Alicia's suicide, Olga unknowingly gave Alicia tea containing a fatal dose and Rowena, fearful of exposure, staged everything.\n19) When blackmail threats arrived, Rowena suspected either Joyce or Leslie.\n20) She attempted to drown Poirot, realized that she had mistaken him for Joyce, and then pushed Joyce to her death.\n21) Later, over the palazzo's internal phone line, she forced Leslie to stab himself by threatening to kill Leopold.\n22) When Poirot confronts Rowena on the roof, Alicia's ghost seems to appear to them both, pulling Rowena down off the building and into the canal where she drowns.\n23) As dawn breaks, Poirot parts ways with Ariadne and chooses not to report Vitale's fraud.\n24) Later, Poirot privately confronts young Leopold, the true blackmailer who needed to support himself and his father: Leopold had identified the poisoning signs that his physician father missed and realized Rowena's first starring role was in an opera whose lead character is the \"king of poisons\".\n25) Poirot suggests Leopold and Olga clear their consciences by financially helping the Hollands begin anew in St. Louis.\n26) His faith mostly restored, Poirot returns home to accept new cases.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better (e.g., 0\u21921\u21922\u21924\u219210)\n- Riches to Rags: Protagonist starts high and ends lower (e.g., 10\u21929\u21928\u21926\u21920)\n- Man in a Hole: Protagonist falls into trouble but recovers (e.g., 6\u21922\u21921\u21924\u219210)\n- Icarus: Protagonist rises then falls dramatically (e.g., 2\u21924\u21929\u21925\u21921)\n- Double Man in a Hole: Two cycles of fall and recovery (e.g., 6\u21922\u21927\u21924\u219210)\n- Cinderella: Rise, setback, ultimate triumph (e.g., 1\u21927\u21924\u21921\u219210)\n- Oedipus: Start high, fall, recover, final fall (e.g., 10\u21924\u21927\u21929\u21921)",

This pattern suggests that the story arc type is not one of consistent improvement or simple decline but rather a complex trajectory that involves both rise and fall.\n\nHowever, considering the overall trend from Alex's initial state of peace and solitude to his final state of emotional scarring and struggle, it can be argued that his condition worsens from the beginning to the end of the story. He starts with a form of \"riches\" (peace and solitude) and ends in \"rags\" (emotional pain and regret), which aligns with a specific story arc type.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\n1. The protagonist of the story is Emily, a young and talented computer science major at Trinity University in New York.\n2. Five major events in the story are:\n   - Event 1: Emily astounds her cybersecurity class by deciphering an RSA encryption algorithm (Sentence 1).\n   - Event 2: Emily meets Jon, a charismatic literature major, during an exploration of D.H. Lawrence's novels (Sentence 4).\n   - Event 3: Emily and Jon are paired together for an interdisciplinary project competition (Sentence 5).\n   - Event 4: Emily and Jon clinch first place in the academic project contest (Sentence 9).\n   - Event 5: Emily and Jon realize their feelings for each other and interpret their shared triumph as a sign of attraction (Sentence 10).\n\n### Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- At Event 1, Emily's state is one of intellectual triumph and recognition. She is admired for her talent, indicating a high point in her academic life.\n- Moving to Event 2, Emily's state evolves as she meets Jon. This introduces a new dimension to her life\u2014personal connection and potential romance\u2014though her intellectual prowess remains a core aspect of her identity. Her state is still positive, with an added layer of personal growth.\n- By Event 3, Emily is faced with the challenge of working with someone from a different academic background. Initially, this might be seen as a potential dilemma or a test of her adaptability. Her state could be considered as entering a period of uncertainty or slight discomfort due to the unknown outcomes of the project.\n- At Event 4, Emily's state improves significantly as she and Jon succeed in the project competition. This success not only boosts her academic standing but also fosters a deeper connection with Jon, enhancing her personal life. This event marks a clear upward trend in her overall state.\n- By Event 5, Emily's state has transformed further. She has not only achieved academic success but has also found a romantic connection with Jon. Her initial melancholy (mentioned in Sentence 3) seems to have been alleviated by her experiences and the positive outcomes of her interactions with Jon. This indicates a substantial improvement in her emotional and personal life.\n\n### Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the progression of Emily's state throughout the story, it's evident that she starts from a position of intellectual strength but personal melancholy, faces challenges and uncertainties, and then rises to achieve both academic success and personal fulfillment. This trajectory aligns with a story arc where the protagonist's condition improves from the initial point to the final point, despite facing challenges and uncertainties along the way.\n\nThe determined story arc type is Rags to Riches."

peace and justice prevailing where chaos had once reigned.\n44) The journey shared by Adrienne and Elijah had ignited a reformation that extended beyond personal metamorphosis to modify societal norms and constructs.\n45) Thus unfolds the saga of 'Redemption\u2019s Price', an orchestration of grit, resilience, and the promise of hope, echoing the aspirations of a society yearning for equity and compassion.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better (e.g., 0\u21921\u21922\u21924\u219210)\n- Riches to Rags: Protagonist starts high and ends lower (e.g., 10\u21929\u21928\u21926\u21920)\n- Man in a Hole: Protagonist falls into trouble but recovers (e.g., 6\u21922\u21921\u21924\u219210)\n- Icarus: Protagonist rises then falls dramatically (e.g., 2\u21924\u21929\u21925\u21921)\n- Double Man in a Hole: Two cycles of fall and recovery (e.g., 6\u21922\u21927\u21924\u219210)\n- Cinderella: Rise, setback, ultimate triumph (e.g., 1\u21927\u21924\u21921\u219210)\n- Oedipus: Start high, fall, recover, final fall (e.g., 10\u21924\u21927\u21929\u21921)",

She not only achieves her goal of bringing the perpetrators to justice but also undergoes a significant personal transformation, emerging as an icon of feminine strength and a proponent of fairness and righteousness.\n\nGiven this progression, the story arc type can be classified as a **Man in a Hole** because Adrienne falls into a dilemma (the attack on her friend and her subsequent feelings of helplessness) and then finds a way out, ending in a better state than where she began (transformed and empowered).\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identification of Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Bea, a female soldier renowned for her wits and strategic thinking. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. Bea stands tall amidst the discouragement and devastation after the British onslaught, planning to ensnare Captain James \"Jim\" Bristow (sentence 4).\n2. Bea reveals her ruse and ensnares Jim with the help of her rebel comrades (sentence 12).\n3. Jim sees through Bea's hardened exterior, and they engage in deep conversations about life, war, and loss, unveiling Bea's past (sentence 15).\n4. Bea decides to free Jim, sabotaging the lone watchtower to assist his escape (sentence 25).\n5. Bea is branded a traitor and deserted by her rebel comrades after Jim's escape (sentence 27).\n\n### 2. Description of Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Bea's state is one of determination and strength. She is planning to ensnare a British officer, which shows her proactive and courageous stance amidst a grim backdrop.\n- **Event 2**: Bea's state changes to one of control and dominance as she successfully captures Jim. This event shows an increase in her power and influence in the story.\n- **Event 3**: Bea's state shifts to a more vulnerable one as Jim sees through her exterior and she opens up about her past. This marks a turning point where her emotional wall is breached, and she begins to develop feelings for Jim.\n- **Event 4**: Bea's state is one of empathy and risk-taking as she decides to free Jim. This decision puts her in a precarious position, showing a significant change from her initial goal of capturing him.\n- **Event 5**: Bea's state is one of isolation and danger as she is branded a traitor. This event shows a significant downfall in her social standing and security within her group.\n\n### 3. Classification of Story Arc Type\n\nAnalyzing Bea's state throughout these events, we can observe a pattern. Initially, Bea is in a position of strength and determination. As the story progresses, she faces a moral dilemma and begins to question her initial intentions, leading to a vulnerable state. Her decision to free Jim leads to a significant downfall in her social standing, marking a low point. However, this story does not simply end with her downfall; the impact of her actions continues, affecting Jim's perception of the war and his enemies. \n\nGiven these observations, the story arc can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout. The protagonist starts in a relatively strong position, faces challenges that lead to a vulnerable state, makes a risky decision that results in a significant downfall, but ultimately, her actions have a profound and positive impact on another character, suggesting a form of redemption or positive outcome from her sacrifices.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Oliver, a young non-verbal autistic boy. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Oliver discovers the \"Misunderstood Monsters\" app and meets Larry** (sentences 4-6): This event introduces the supernatural element and marks the beginning of Oliver's interaction with Larry.\n2. **Oliver is bullied, and his phone is taken** (sentence 8): This event highlights Oliver's vulnerability and the challenges he faces due to his condition.\n3. **Larry appears and attacks one of the boys who bullied Oliver** (sentences 12-14): This event shows the consequences of Oliver's connection with Larry and how it affects those around him.\n4. **Sarah takes Larry's hand to save Oliver** (sentence 30): This event is a turning point where Oliver's mother sacrifices herself to protect him, changing Oliver's circumstances dramatically.\n5. **Oliver lives with Marty after Sarah's disappearance** (sentences 33-38): This final event shows the aftermath of Sarah's sacrifice and how Oliver's life has changed.\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Oliver's state is one of curiosity and possibly loneliness, given his interest in the \"Misunderstood Monsters\" app. His condition hasn't changed significantly from the beginning of the story, but this event sets the stage for future changes.\n- **Event 2**: Oliver's state worsens as he faces bullying and loses his primary means of communication. This event shows a decline in his well-being and safety.\n- **Event 3**: With Larry's appearance and attack, Oliver's state becomes more complex. While the bullies are punished, Oliver also becomes more entangled with the supernatural, which could be seen as both a form of protection and a source of danger. His condition is volatile and precarious.\n- **Event 4**: When Sarah takes Larry's hand, Oliver's state improves dramatically because he is saved from being taken by Larry. This act of sacrifice by his mother removes the immediate danger and shows a peak in Oliver's well-being, at least in terms of safety.\n- **Event 5**: After Sarah's disappearance, Oliver's state is one of loss and adjustment. He is now living with his father, and while there is an effort to rebuild and heal, the loss of his mother is a significant downfall. However, the final scene suggests a form of closure and hope, as Oliver sees his mother happy in another world.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the changes in Oliver's state throughout the story, we can observe that he starts in a vulnerable position, faces significant challenges and dangers, but then experiences a form of rescue and adjustment. His condition improves with his mother's sacrifice but then worsens again with her loss. However, the story ends on a hopeful note, suggesting that Oliver and those around him are finding ways to cope and possibly heal.\n\nThe story arc that best fits this pattern is the **Man in a Hole**. This arc is characterized by the protagonist falling into a dilemma and then finding a way out, often ending in a better state than where they began. While Oliver faces multiple challenges and the story takes a complex route, the overall trajectory from his initial vulnerability, through the dangers and losses, to the final scene of hope and adjustment, aligns with the **Man in a Hole** arc. The key aspect is the recovery and the eventual better state, despite the setbacks, which is evident in Oliver's ability to cope with his loss and find a new sense of security and hope.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and Major Events\nThe protagonist of the story is George Foreman. Five major events in the story are:\n1. George Foreman joins the Job Corps as a last-ditch effort to turn his life around (sentence 3).\n2. Foreman wins the gold medal for the United States at the 1968 Summer Olympics (sentence 6).\n3. Foreman becomes the heavyweight champion after winning a fight against Joe Frazier in 1973 (sentence 8).\n4. Foreman has a near-death experience and becomes a devout Christian, disavowing boxing to become a full-time preacher (sentences 16-17).\n5. Foreman regains his title as heavyweight champion of the world after winning a match against Michael Moorer (sentence 28).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes\n- **Event 1 (Joining Job Corps):** Foreman is at a low point, struggling with anger issues and violent outbursts, but seeking a change. This marks the beginning of his journey towards improvement.\n- **Event 2 (Winning Olympic Gold):** Foreman's condition has significantly improved; he has found a positive outlet for his anger (boxing) and is achieving success. This is an upward turn in his life.\n- **Event 3 (Becoming Heavyweight Champion):** Foreman reaches a peak in his career and personal life, having overcome his initial struggles and achieved great success. However, this success also leads to personal problems like infidelity.\n- **Event 4 (Near-Death Experience and Conversion):** After facing a series of setbacks, including losing his championship and his marriage, Foreman hits a spiritual low but then experiences a profound personal transformation, becoming a devout Christian. This marks a significant change in his personal life, as he seeks redemption and a new path.\n- **Event 5 (Regaining Heavyweight Title):** Foreman's condition has improved again; he has not only regained his physical prowess and boxing title but has also found a new sense of purpose and peace through his faith. This event shows that Foreman has come full circle, achieving success once more but this time with a deeper understanding of himself and his values.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\nThe story follows George Foreman through two major cycles of improvement and decline. Initially, he rises from a life of poverty and violence to become a successful boxer, which can be seen as the first \"man in a hole\" scenario where he improves his condition. However, he then falls into another dilemma due to his personal issues and losses, only to find his way out again through his spiritual transformation and eventual return to boxing, culminating in regaining his championship title. This pattern of falling into a dilemma, finding a way out, and then facing another dilemma before ultimately recovering and ending in a better state than where he started is characteristic of the **Double Man in a Hole** story arc.\n\n### 4.

Classify the story arc type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, it appears that Jake's state worsens over time. He starts in a traumatic situation, but then takes risks and tries to find a new sense of purpose. However, things take a turn for the worse as he faces danger and loss, and ultimately, he is forced to make a difficult sacrifice to save his brother. This pattern of worsening conditions is consistent with the \"Riches to Rags\" story arc type, but it can also be argued that Jake's initial state is already quite low, and he does experience some moments of hope and determination before things take a turn for the worse. However, considering the overall trend of Jake's condition, it seems that his state deteriorates significantly over the course of the story.\n\n### 4. Determined story arc type\n\nRiches to Rags"

The group is ambushed, and Heron is abducted (sentence 5).\n     2. Adem is mortally wounded, and Beyah suggests cannibalizing his body (sentence 9).\n     3. Beyah escapes after being attempted to be sacrificed to a demon by Odal (sentence 12).\n     4. Beyah and Geirr discover the Neanderthal is not a monster but a human (sentence 16).\n     5. Beyah kills the Neanderthal female and escapes with Heron, later reflecting on her actions (sentences 24-26).\n\n2. **Describe the protagonist's state and changes at each event:**\n   - **Event 1 (Heron's abduction):** Beyah's state is one of survival and low status within the group. Her situation changes as she becomes more involved in the group's dynamics due to the crisis.\n   - **Event 2 (Adem's death and cannibalism):** Beyah's state shifts as she takes a significant action (suggesting cannibalism) that shows her willingness to do whatever it takes to survive, potentially increasing her influence or changing her status within the group.\n   - **Event 3 (Beyah's escape from sacrifice):** Beyah falls into a deeper hole as she is targeted and has to fight for her life, but she manages to escape, which is a turning point where she begins to take more control of her situation.\n   - **Event 4 (Discovery of the Neanderthal):** Beyah's state improves as she discovers the truth about the Neanderthals, which could lead to a better understanding of their world and potentially safer conditions.\n   - **Event 5 (Killing the Neanderthal and reflection):** Beyah's state changes again as she kills to protect herself and Heron, and later reflects on her actions, showing growth and a different perspective on her situation and the world around her.\n\n3. **Classify the story arc type:**\n   - The story can be seen as a **Double Man in a Hole** because Beyah faces at least two significant dilemmas (being targeted for sacrifice and facing the Neanderthals) from which she recovers, ending in a better state than where she started. Initially, she is part of a starving, ragtag group with a low ranking. Through her experiences, especially after Heron's abduction and Adem's death, she faces numerous challenges but manages to survive and eventually find a new home with Heron. Her condition improves significantly from the start, where she was on the brink of starvation and had a low status, to the end, where she has found a new place to live and has taken on a more significant role in ensuring her and Heron's survival.\n\n4. **Determined story arc type:**\nDouble Man in a Hole"

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Jamie New, a 16-year-old gay boy who dreams of being a drag queen. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. Jamie's 16th birthday party, where his father fails to show up, and he receives a pair of expensive red high heels from his mother.\n2. Jamie's decision to perform as a drag queen at the local club, with the help of Hugo Battersby, the owner of the drag shop House of Loco.\n3. Jamie's performance as Mimi Me at the drag show, where he faces initial heckling but ultimately succeeds and gains confidence.\n4. Jamie's confrontation with his father, where he learns the truth about his father's disinterest and disappointment in him.\n5. The prom night, where Jamie decides to attend as himself, wearing a traditional girls' prom dress, and faces initial rejection from Hedge but is eventually supported by his classmates.\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1:** Jamie's state is one of disappointment and unfulfilled expectations due to his father's absence. However, he also experiences joy and support from his mother, symbolized by the gift of the high heels. His state is hopeful but tinged with sadness.\n- **Event 2:** Jamie's state evolves to one of determination and aspiration as he decides to pursue his dream of being a drag queen. With Hugo's mentorship, Jamie feels supported and encouraged, marking an improvement in his state from mere hope to active pursuit of his dreams.\n- **Event 3:** At the drag show, Jamie initially faces anxiety and fear of rejection. However, after successfully performing as Mimi Me, his state shifts to one of triumph and heightened confidence. This event marks a significant peak in Jamie's journey, where he overcomes his fears and gains acceptance and applause.\n- **Event 4:** The confrontation with his father leads to a downturn in Jamie's state. He experiences shock, hurt, and betrayal upon learning the truth about his father's feelings. This event marks a low point in Jamie's journey, where his sense of identity and self-worth is challenged.\n- **Event 5:** On prom night, Jamie's state reflects a mix of resilience, self-acceptance, and the desire for genuine connection. By choosing to attend as himself and facing the potential for rejection, Jamie demonstrates growth and a stronger sense of self. The support he eventually receives from his classmates further improves his state, ending on a note of acceptance and belonging.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc of Jamie New can be classified by analyzing the trajectory of his condition throughout the narrative. Initially, Jamie faces disappointment and unfulfilled expectations, marking a low point. As he pursues his dreams and finds support, his condition improves, leading to a peak of confidence and success at the drag show. However, this is followed by a significant downturn when he confronts the harsh reality of his father's feelings, marking another low point. Finally, Jamie recovers and grows, ending in a higher state of self-acceptance and social acceptance at the prom.\n\nThis pattern of rising to a peak, facing a setback, and ultimately achieving a higher state aligns with the **Cinderella** story arc type. The Cinderella arc is characterized by the protagonist's journey from a lowly state, through a series of challenges and setbacks, to a ultimately higher state of success and recognition. Jamie's story follows this arc, as he moves from feeling marginalized and unsupported, through the challenge of pursuing his dream and facing rejection, to finally finding acceptance and confidence in himself.\n\n### 4.

Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Augustine Lofthouse, a reclusive academic dedicated to finding habitable planets. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. Lofthouse meets Jean Sullivan and they form a romantic relationship (sentence 2).\n2. Lofthouse refuses to meet his daughter after Jean tells him about her (sentence 4).\n3. Lofthouse discovers he is alone in an Arctic base after an event has devastated Earth (sentence 6).\n4. Lofthouse finds and grows fond of a young mute girl, Iris, in the base (sentence 12).\n5. Lofthouse successfully contacts the crew of Aether and advises them not to return to Earth, learning that one of the crew members, Sully, is his daughter (sentences 20-26).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1:** Lofthouse is in a relationship, indicating a period of connection and possibly happiness. His state is relatively positive.\n- **Event 2:** Lofthouse's refusal to meet his daughter shows a significant personal loss and regret, marking a downturn in his emotional state due to his inability to form connections.\n- **Event 3:** Lofthouse is alone, terminally ill, and faced with the apocalypse, which is a drastic fall in his physical and emotional condition.\n- **Event 4:** Finding Iris brings a sense of purpose and companionship to Lofthouse, improving his emotional state despite his worsening physical health.\n- **Event 5:** Learning that Sully is his daughter and being able to help her and the crew of Aether gives Lofthouse a sense of redemption and fulfillment, especially since he had previously been unable to connect with his family. This marks an improvement in his emotional state.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the changes in Lofthouse's condition throughout the story, it can be observed that he faces significant personal and physical challenges (falling into dilemmas) but also experiences moments of recovery and improvement (finding a way out of these dilemmas). Initially, he is in a relationship, then faces loss and isolation, followed by a period of solitude and illness, then finds companionship with Iris, and finally achieves a form of redemption through his connection with Sully.\n\nThe story does not follow a simple linear improvement or decline. Instead, Lofthouse's condition worsens significantly after the initial relationship, hits a low point with his isolation and illness, improves slightly with the introduction of Iris, and then reaches a form of emotional resolution with the revelation about Sully. This pattern of facing challenges, finding ways to cope or improve, and then facing another challenge before ultimately achieving a form of redemption or resolution aligns with the **Double Man in a Hole** story arc type. This type involves the protagonist facing two cycles of dilemma and recovery, which fits Lofthouse's journey of personal loss, physical decline, brief moments of connection and purpose, and ultimate emotional resolution.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story can be considered as Lily, the petite girl known for her large round glasses, who plans to bring her girlfriend, Kiera, to the Winter Formal. This identification is based on the impact of the story's events on her and the focus on her personal journey and challenges throughout the narrative.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. **The Cancellation of the Winter Formal**: The news of the cancellation comes as a shock, significantly affecting Lily's plans and emotional state.\n2. **Mr. Gonzales' Decision to Host an \"Anti-Formal\"**: This event offers Lily a glimmer of hope and a chance to still experience a special night with her girlfriend, Kiera.\n3. **The Preparations for the Anti-Formal**: As the students work together to prepare for the event, Lily finds support and encouragement, which helps in boosting her confidence and emotional state.\n4. **The Night of the Anti-Formal**: The event turns out to be a success, with Lily and Kiera sharing a memorable moment on the dance floor, symbolizing their love and the community's acceptance.\n5. **Mrs. Jones' Resignation and the Town's Transformation**: This final event marks a significant change in the town's attitude towards acceptance and inclusivity, directly benefiting Lily and the LGBTQ+ community.\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1: The Cancellation of the Winter Formal**: Lily's state is one of shock, fear, and disappointment. Her plans with Kiera are ruined, and she faces the reality of discrimination.\n- **Event 2: Mr. Gonzales' Decision to Host an \"Anti-Formal\"**: Lily's state begins to shift towards hope and positivity. She sees an opportunity to still have a special night and feels supported by Mr. Gonzales and his effort to stand up against the discrimination.\n- **Event 3: The Preparations for the Anti-Formal**: Lily becomes more involved and engaged. Her state improves as she sees the community coming together to support her and Kiera, boosting her confidence.\n- **Event 4: The Night of the Anti-Formal**: Lily experiences a peak of happiness and acceptance. She and Kiera share a beautiful moment, and the event is a success, showing that their love is accepted and celebrated by their peers.\n- **Event 5: Mrs. Jones' Resignation and the Town's Transformation**: Lily's state reaches a new high. The town's transformation towards acceptance and the resignation of Mrs. Jones, who symbolized the old, discriminatory ways, mark a significant victory for Lily and the community.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story follows Lily as she falls into a dilemma (the cancellation of the Winter Formal and the discrimination she faces) and then finds a way out, ending in a better state than at the beginning (the success of the anti-formal and the town's transformation towards acceptance). This pattern aligns with the **Man in a Hole** story arc type, where the protagonist's condition improves from the first turning point to the last turning point. The narrative shows Lily moving from a state of fear and disappointment to one of hope, acceptance, and ultimately, victory over prejudice.\n\n### 4. Determined Story Arc Type\n\nMan in a Hole"

Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Ellie, a 24-year-old woman who was adopted and is on a journey to discover her roots and reunite with her biological family.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. Ellie decides to meet her biological siblings face-to-face and return to her ancestral home in Japan (Event 5).\n2. Ellie's plans are disrupted by a destructive earthquake in her birth town, leading her to be rerouted to Tokyo (Event 7).\n3. Ellie meets Lily, a compassionate BBC Asia journalist, who helps her in her quest to uncover her roots (Event 11).\n4. Ellie discovers potential information about her birth parents and eventually reunites with them (Events 16 and 18).\n5. Ellie decides to reside in Tokyo to care for her birth parents and works on reuniting her dispersed family (Events 23 and 25).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- At Event 1, Ellie's state is one of yearning and longing for her roots. She is determined to meet her siblings and learn more about her past.\n- At Event 2, Ellie's plans are disrupted, and she is faced with uncertainty and possibly fear about what she will find in Tokyo instead of her intended destination. Her state has become more challenging and unpredictable.\n- At Event 3, Ellie meets Lily, which marks a positive turn in her journey. She now has support and help in navigating her quest, improving her state from one of solo struggle to having a supportive ally.\n- At Event 4, Ellie reunites with her birth parents, which is an emotionally charged experience. While it brings joy, it also reveals hardships and challenges her parents faced, leaving Ellie with a mix of emotions but a deeper understanding of her roots. Her state has evolved to include a sense of fulfillment and also possibly guilt or regret for not knowing her parents' situation sooner.\n- At Event 5, Ellie decides to take charge of her new reality by residing in Tokyo to care for her parents. This decision shows growth, responsibility, and a newfound sense of purpose. Ellie's state has transformed from one of seeking her roots to finding a way to contribute positively to her family's life, indicating a significant improvement in her condition.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the changes in Ellie's state throughout the story, we observe that she starts with a desire to connect with her roots, faces setbacks and challenges (such as the earthquake and the difficulties in finding her birth parents), but ultimately rises to a higher state of being through her reunions and her decision to care for her birth parents. This pattern of rising, facing a setback, and ultimately achieving a higher state aligns with the **Cinderella** story arc type. The Cinderella arc is characterized by the protagonist's journey from a lower state to a higher one, often with a temporary setback, which is exactly what Ellie experiences as she navigates her way to discovering her roots, facing challenges, and ultimately finding a new sense of purpose and belonging.\n\n### 4.

Edmund is vindicated, and the real culprit is exposed (sentence 24).\n\n2. **Describe the protagonist's state and how it changed relative to the previous events:**\n   - **Event 1 (Hugo's routine is disrupted):** Hugo's state is one of routine and possibly inner turmoil due to his job and social isolation. The arrival of Edmund introduces a new variable into his life.\n   - **Event 2 (Hugo starts to doubt Edmund's guilt):** Hugo's state changes to one of doubt and moral questioning. He begins to see the world differently, indicating a shift from his previous resigned state.\n   - **Event 3 (Uncovering a secret):** Hugo's state becomes more proactive and engaged. He is now committed to uncovering the truth, showing a significant change from his initial passive role as an executioner.\n   - **Event 4 (Rushing to stop the execution):** Hugo's state is one of urgency and determination. He is fully invested in saving Edmund, marking a peak in his proactive stance.\n   - **Event 5 (Edmund's vindication):** Hugo's state is one of relief and possibly vindication of his own moral compass. He has successfully challenged the system and helped an innocent man, which can be seen as an improvement from his initial state.\n\n3. **Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain the reasoning:**\n   - The story follows Hugo as he moves from a state of moral ambiguity and routine (as an executioner) to one of action and moral clarity. Initially, Hugo is in a \"hole\" due to his role and the doubts that arise with Edmund's case. As the story progresses, Hugo finds a way out of this dilemma by taking action, uncovering the truth, and ultimately saving Edmund. This journey from a lower state (moral ambiguity and inaction) to a higher state (moral clarity and proactive engagement) fits the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc.

he is consequently reliant on several specialized biomechanical devices, including a bed, a machine through which Caprice performs surgery on him, and a chair that twitches and rotates as it assists him with eating.\n9) Tenser and Caprice meet with bureaucrats in charge of the National Organ Registry, a governmental office designed to uphold the state's restrictions on human evolution by cataloging and storing newly evolved organs.\n10) One of the bureaucrats, the nervy Timlin, becomes captivated by Tenser's artistic goals.\n11) At a successful show of Tenser's, she tells him that \"surgery is the new sex\", a sentiment that Tenser and many other characters appear to embrace as repetitive cutting seems to be replacing traditional sex and masturbation as the preferred means of sexual gratification.\n12) A governmental police unit seeks to use Tenser to infiltrate a group of radical evolutionists.\n13) Without telling Caprice, Tenser meets a series of contacts through other biological performance art shows that lead him to the evolutionist cell.\n14) One of them, former cosmetic surgeon Nasatir, creates a zippered cavern in Tenser's stomach, which Caprice uses to access Tenser's organs in an oral sex act where she fellates his zipper wound and presumably his internal organs while he moans in erotic pleasure.\n15) Caprice continues to network with other performance artists, eventually choosing to receive decorative cosmetic surgery on her forehead.\n16) Tenser meets with Timlin, who reveals to him the agenda of the evolutionists: they have chosen to modify their digestive system to make them able to eat plastics and other synthetic chemicals.\n17) Their principal food is a purple processed \"candy bar\" of toxic waste, fatally poisonous to others.\n18) Lang is the leader of the cell; his son Brecken had been born with the ability to eat plastic, proving the inaccuracy of the government's critical stance on human evolution.\n19) Timlin tries to initiate sex with Tenser, but he says he is not good at \"the old sex\".\n20) Tenser is eventually approached by Lang, who wants Tenser and Caprice to reveal the cell's anti-government agenda through a public autopsy of Brecken that will highlight his evolved digestive system.\n21) After some deliberation, Tenser agrees.\n22) With Timlin, Lang, and many others watching, Tenser performs the autopsy, but it is revealed that Brecken's natural organ system has been surgically replaced.\n23) Lang flees the show in tears.\n24) Outside, he is approached by two agents who supposedly work for the corporation that manufactures Tenser's biomedical machines.\n25) Mimicking their earlier killing of Nasatir, they assassinate Lang by driving power drills into his head.\n26) Tenser's connection within the police unit admits that Timlin replaced Brecken's organs to keep the deviation in human evolution secret from the public.\n27) Saddened by Brecken and Lang's deaths, Tenser informs the police that he will no longer serve them, approvingly mentioning the cell's beliefs on evolution.\n28) Tenser struggles to eat in his chair.\n29) He asks Caprice to give him a bar of plastic.\n30) As Caprice records him, he eats it, looks into Caprice's camera, and sheds a tear.\n31) His mouth twitches into a smile as the chair finally quiets.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better (e.g., 0\u21921\u21922\u21924\u219210)\n- Riches to Rags: Protagonist starts high and ends lower (e.g., 10\u21929\u21928\u21926\u21920)\n- Man in a Hole: Protagonist falls into trouble but recovers (e.g., 6\u21922\u21921\u21924\u219210)\n- Icarus: Protagonist rises then falls dramatically (e.g., 2\u21924\u21929\u21925\u21921)\n- Double Man in a Hole: Two cycles of fall and recovery (e.g., 6\u21922\u21927\u21924\u219210)\n- Cinderella: Rise, setback, ultimate triumph (e.g., 1\u21927\u21924\u21921\u219210)\n- Oedipus: Start high, fall, recover, final fall (e.g., 10\u21924\u21927\u21929\u21921)",
        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story can be identified as Saul Tenser, a performance artist with \"accelerated evolution syndrome.\" Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Tenser and Caprice meet with bureaucrats**: Tenser and Caprice discuss their artistic goals with the National Organ Registry.\n2. **Tenser agrees to infiltrate the evolutionist cell**: He decides to work with the government to infiltrate a group of radical evolutionists.\n3. **Tenser performs the autopsy of Brecken**: A public autopsy that reveals Brecken's natural organ system has been surgically replaced.\n4. **Lang is assassinated**: The leader of the evolutionist cell is killed by agents working for a corporation.\n5. **Tenser eats plastic and sheds a tear**: After learning the truth about Brecken and Lang's deaths, Tenser decides to eat plastic, symbolizing his acceptance of the evolutionists' beliefs.\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: Tenser is in a state of artistic expression and exploration, using his condition to create performance art. He is somewhat dependent on his biomechanical devices but is managing his condition.\n- **Event 2**: Tenser's state changes as he becomes more involved with the government's agenda, potentially putting him at risk but also giving him a sense of purpose beyond his art.\n- **Event 3**: Tenser's condition worsens emotionally as he discovers the truth about Brecken's autopsy, feeling betrayed and possibly guilty for his role in the event.\n- **Event 4**: Upon learning of Lang's assassination, Tenser's state becomes one of sorrow and disillusionment with the system he was initially working with.\n- **Event 5**: Tenser's decision to eat plastic marks a significant change in his state, as he moves towards acceptance and possibly evolution beyond his current human form, symbolizing a form of transcendence or new beginning.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the story. Initially, Tenser is in a unique but manageable situation (accelerated evolution syndrome), which could be considered a high point due to his success as a performance artist. However, as he becomes involved with the government and the evolutionist cell, his condition and emotional state fluctuate. The revelation of Brecken's altered body and Lang's assassination lead to a significant downfall in Tenser's emotional and possibly physical state. Finally, Tenser's decision to eat plastic could be seen as a recovery or a new beginning, but given the context, it's more about his acceptance of a new path rather than a return to a previous state.\n\nGiven the fluctuations in Tenser's condition, from a managed success, through betrayal and disillusionment, to a form of acceptance and new path, the story arc seems to follow a pattern of rise, fall, and then another significant change.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist in the story is John Thompson. Five major events in the story are:\n1. John discovers a concealed trapdoor in the treehouse, leading him to an underground labyrinth (sentence 3-4).\n2. John becomes the primary suspect in the disappearance of Bethany Dunhill, leading to a whirlpool of mistrust and finger-pointing from the community (sentence 7-8).\n3. John uncovers the dark secrets of the underground maze, including evidence of a cult's atrocities and its connection to the town's missing children (sentence 9-10).\n4. John infiltrates one of the cult's secret rituals but is discovered, leading to a dangerous pursuit (sentence 13-15).\n5. John, with the help of the police, confronts and defeats the cult, leading to the rescue of Bethany and the beginning of John's redemption (sentence 19-20).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: John's state is one of seeking refuge and solace, haunted by his addiction but finding serenity in the treehouse. This event sets him on a path of discovery and potential change.\n- **Event 2**: John's state worsens as he becomes a suspect, facing suspicion and hostility from the community. His condition deteriorates due to the external pressure and his own internal struggles with addiction.\n- **Event 3**: John's state begins to improve as he uncovers the truth about the cult. This gives him a sense of purpose and direction, potentially marking a turning point in his struggle with addiction.\n- **Event 4**: John's state becomes more precarious as he is hunted by the cult. This event introduces significant danger and raises the stakes, testing John's resolve and courage.\n- **Event 5**: John's state improves dramatically as he succeeds in rescuing Bethany and contributing to the defeat of the cult. This success, coupled with his decision to renew his quest for sobriety, indicates a significant positive change in his condition.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the narrative. Given that John starts in a disadvantaged situation (struggling with addiction and personal loss), faces significant challenges and dangers (becoming a suspect, being hunted by a cult), but ultimately ends in a better situation (having helped defeat the cult, rescuing a victim, and renewing his quest for sobriety), his condition improves from the beginning to the end. This pattern, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (or several) and finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning, aligns with the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc type. The key characteristic of this arc is the protagonist's ability to overcome adversity and emerge in a superior state, which is evident in John's transformation from a haunted, addicted individual to someone on the path to redemption and recovery.\n\n### 4.

Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the story. \n- Initially, Evan is in a state of disadvantage (writer's block), which can be considered as the \"rags\" part of a story arc.\n- As the story progresses, Evan's condition improves significantly. He finds inspiration, overcomes his writer's block, and finds love, which can be seen as moving towards \"riches.\"\n- There are no significant downturns after Evan's initial improvement, indicating a consistent upward trajectory in his condition.\n\nGiven this progression, the story fits the **Rags to Riches** arc, where the protagonist starts in a disadvantaged situation and ends in a much better one, with continuous improvement from the first turning point to the last.\n\n### 4.

Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the progression of Max's state throughout the story, we can observe that he starts in a disadvantaged situation (social anxiety and isolation), faces setbacks (the disastrous date), but then experiences improvement as he is forced into co-parenting and eventually bonds with Nicole. The story ends on a high note with both characters achieving personal growth and success. This pattern aligns with a story arc where the protagonist rises to a higher state after facing setbacks, which is characteristic of the **Cinderella** story arc type. The **Cinderella** arc involves a protagonist who starts in a poor state, faces challenges, but ultimately achieves a happy ending, which matches the narrative of Max and Nicole's story.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is John Walker, a hardened citizen and skilled fighter pilot living in a post-apocalyptic world under the totalitarian rule of Fern.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. Fern kidnaps John's wife, Sarah, and sends her back to 2018 using the TimeShift machine (Event 3).\n2. John steals a TimeShift device and travels back to 2018 to rescue Sarah (Event 6-7).\n3. John and his ally, Jim, successfully rescue Sarah from Fern's clutches in 2018 (Event 23).\n4. John, Sarah, and Jim return to their dystopian future, bringing with them evidence of Fern's brutality (Event 25-28).\n5. John and Sarah lead a revolt against Fern, inspiring the oppressed citizens to fight back (Event 32-42).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Fern kidnaps Sarah):** John's state is one of grief and outrage. His condition worsens significantly as he loses his beloved wife to Fern's cruelty.\n- **Event 2 (John travels back to 2018):** John's state is determined and risky. He takes a significant gamble by stealing the TimeShift device and traveling back in time. His condition improves slightly as he takes action towards rescuing Sarah.\n- **Event 3 (Successful rescue of Sarah):** John's state is relieved and triumphant. He has overcome significant odds to rescue his wife, improving his condition.\n- **Event 4 (Return to the dystopian future):** John's state is hopeful but risky. He and his companions face danger as they return to their own time with evidence to challenge Fern's rule. This event maintains a level of risk but also offers a glimmer of hope for change.\n- **Event 5 (Leading the revolt):** John's state is empowering and courageous. He transitions from being an individual acting against the regime to a leader of a movement, significantly improving his condition as he inspires and leads others to fight for their freedom.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nAnalyzing John's condition throughout these events:\n- He starts in a disadvantaged situation (living under oppression, then losing his wife).\n- He falls into a deeper dilemma (having to travel back in time, facing numerous dangers).\n- He finds a way out of this dilemma by rescuing his wife and returning to his time.\n- He ends in a better situation than where he started, as he not only rescues his wife but also becomes a leader in the revolt against Fern, improving the condition of himself and potentially the entire society.\n\nThis pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist faces significant challenges, overcomes them, and ends in a better state than where he began. The initial fall into a dilemma (loss of his wife and the risks of time travel) followed by a recovery (rescuing his wife and returning) and then moving into an even better state (leading a revolt) aligns with the characteristics of a specific story arc.\n\n### 4.

It's not a **Riches to Rags** story since Chun-Hei ends in a better state than she began. The **Man in a Hole** arc is closer because Chun-Hei falls into dilemmas (loss of family, Ming's illness) and finds ways out, but the story's complexity, with its multiple downturns and recoveries, suggests a more nuanced classification.\n\nThe **Icarus** story arc, which involves a rise to success followed by a drastic downfall, does not perfectly fit because Chun-Hei's story is more about resilience and ultimate growth rather than a tragic fall. The **Cinderella** arc, involving a rise, a setback, and then a higher achievement, seems more applicable because Chun-Hei rises from her grief with Ming's help, faces a setback with his illness, and ultimately achieves a higher state by deciding to move to Singapore for a safer life.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is the Slayer, an enigmatic figure known for his lethal abilities. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **The Assignment**: The Slayer receives a mission from Mr. X to assassinate El Patron (sentence 7).\n2. **The Confrontation with Maria**: The Slayer faces a heated confrontation with Maria, who is suspicious of his activities and pleas with him to abandon his deadly intent (sentence 21).\n3. **Maria's Kidnapping**: El Patron's entourage kidnaps Maria, drawing the Slayer into a personal feud (sentence 27).\n4. **The Rescue Mission**: The Slayer embarks on a mission to save Maria, leading to a confrontation with El Patron and his guards (sentence 29).\n5. **The Escape**: The Slayer and Maria escape the chaotic crime scene with the help of Officer Lopez and flee into the unknown (sentence 38).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **At the Assignment**: The Slayer is in a state of professional engagement, receiving a mission that aligns with his skills but also triggers memories of his past and his desire to leave it behind. His state is one of internal conflict but with a clear professional direction.\n- **At the Confrontation with Maria**: The Slayer's state worsens as he faces emotional turmoil. His relationship with Maria and her pleas for him to change his ways deepen his internal conflict, making his situation more complicated and emotionally challenging.\n- **At Maria's Kidnapping**: The Slayer's state becomes one of desperation and urgency. The personal nature of the conflict escalates his emotional investment, and he is driven by a desire for rescue and retribution.\n- **At the Rescue Mission**: The Slayer's state is one of determination and focus. Despite the risks, he is resolute in his mission to save Maria, indicating a peak in his emotional and professional commitment.\n- **At the Escape**: The Slayer's state improves as he and Maria escape, indicating a move towards a better situation. They are no longer in immediate danger, and there's a glimmer of hope for a new beginning, symbolized by their fleeing into the unknown.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, it can be observed that the Slayer starts in a situation of internal conflict due to his past and his relationship with Maria. As the story progresses, he faces a significant downturn with Maria's kidnapping, which complicates his situation and forces him into a dangerous rescue mission. However, he manages to rescue Maria, and they escape together, indicating an improvement in his situation from the start.\n\nThe story arc type that best fits this progression is the **Man in a Hole**. This is because the Slayer falls into a dilemma (Maria's kidnapping and the ensuing conflict) and finds a way out (rescuing Maria and escaping), ending in a better state than when he started (with hope for a new beginning with Maria). The **Man in a Hole** story arc is characterized by the protagonist's condition worsening before it improves, which aligns with the Slayer's journey from internal conflict, through desperation and danger, to eventual escape and the possibility of redemption.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identify the protagonist and 5 major events in the story\n\nThe protagonist of the story can be considered as both Lady D and Sir D, as the narrative focuses on their individual and collective journey. However, for the purpose of analysis, we can consider their combined experiences as the protagonist's arc, given that their stories intertwine and influence each other significantly.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. The introduction of Lady D and Sir D, each living separate lives but both experiencing dissatisfaction (sentences 1-4).\n2. The arrival of the invitation to the art gallery in Paris and their decision to attend, which sets the stage for their meeting (sentence 5).\n3. The encounter at the airport, where they meet and initially clash due to the flight delay (sentences 6-13).\n4. The turning point where, despite their initial animosity, they begin to share stories and find comfort in each other's company, leading to a rekindling of their past camaraderie (sentences 18-22).\n5. The resolution, where they finally board the plane to Paris, having reestablished their friendship and found a new sense of peace and understanding (sentences 28-30).\n\n### 2. Describe the protagonist's state and how it changed relative to the previous events\n\n- **Event 1 (Introduction):** The protagonists, Lady D and Sir D, are introduced in a state of dissatisfaction and ennui, despite their outward success. This sets a low point in their emotional and psychological state.\n- **Event 2 (Invitation to Paris):** The decision to attend the art gallery opening marks a potential turning point for change but does not immediately alter their state of dissatisfaction. It's more of a catalyst for the events that will follow.\n- **Event 3 (Airport Encounter):** Initially, their meeting and the circumstances (flight delay) exacerbate their frustration and dissatisfaction, leading to a further decline in their state. However, this event also marks the beginning of their interaction, which will eventually lead to positive change.\n- **Event 4 (Sharing and Comfort):** As they share their stories and find comfort in each other's company, their state begins to improve. They move from a place of loneliness and dissatisfaction to one of connection and understanding. This is a significant turning point where their condition starts to improve.\n- **Event 5 (Resolution):** By the end, they have rekindled their friendship, found a deeper understanding of each other, and seem to have overcome their initial dissatisfaction. This marks a high point in their emotional and psychological state compared to the beginning of the story.\n\n### 3. Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain your reasoning\n\nThe story arc of Lady D and Sir D follows a pattern where they start in a state of dissatisfaction, face challenges and conflicts (particularly in their initial encounter), but ultimately find a way out of their dilemma through their reconnection and shared experiences. This pattern suggests a \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonists fall into a dilemma (their dissatisfaction and conflict) but find a way out, ending in a better state than they began with. The key characteristic of this arc is the improvement in the protagonist's condition from the lowest point (their clash and frustration at the airport) to the end (their renewed friendship and peace).\n\n### 4.

The talent show concludes with Greg deciding to drum with L\u00f6ded Diper, and his relationship with Rodrick improves (sentences 42-46).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n- **Event 1:** Greg starts in a relatively neutral state, learning his parents are leaving and then getting dragged into Rodrick's party plan. His condition could be considered as falling into a potential dilemma due to Rodrick's influence.\n- **Event 2:** Greg's state worsens as he is exploited and locked in the basement by Rodrick, but he manages to gather blackmail material, indicating a potential for future leverage or improvement in his condition.\n- **Event 3:** Greg's condition improves slightly as he and Rodrick clean up, avoiding immediate punishment, but he is still at odds with Rodrick. This shows a recovery from the previous low point.\n- **Event 4:** Greg's state improves further as he becomes involved with L\u00f6ded Diper and considers joining them, showing an increase in his social standing and personal fulfillment. However, this also introduces tension with Rodrick, complicating his condition.\n- **Event 5:** Greg's condition improves significantly as he decides to drum with L\u00f6ded Diper, and more importantly, his relationship with Rodrick improves, showing a positive resolution to their conflicts and an overall better state than at the beginning of the story.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\nThe story arc can be classified by analyzing the protagonist's condition throughout the major events. Initially, Greg falls into a dilemma (the party and being locked in the basement), then finds a way out and improves his condition (cleaning up and avoiding punishment), faces another challenge (the tension with Rodrick over the band), and finally ends in a better state (improved relationship with Rodrick and involvement with the band). This pattern of falling into a dilemma, recovering, facing another challenge, and ultimately ending in a better state aligns with the **Double Man in a Hole** story arc, where the protagonist faces two cycles of dilemma and recovery.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonists in the story are Emma and Jake. Five major events in the story are:\n1. **Discovery of the Puzzle Chamber**: When Emma and Jake first wake up in the intimidating, cave-like chamber filled with puzzles and riddles that they must solve to survive (sentences 1-6).\n2. **Escape from the Initial Puzzle Chamber**: After solving the puzzles, they manage to escape the deadly confinement, marking a significant turning point in their ordeal (sentences 9-10).\n3. **Investigation and Discovery of Sphinx Corp**: Emma and Jake's research and investigation lead them to uncover the existence of Sphinx Corp, the organization behind their ordeal, and they begin to plan how to infiltrate it (sentences 14-16).\n4. **Infiltration of Sphinx Corp and Second Puzzle Chamber**: They infiltrate Sphinx Corp, only to find themselves facing another, even more complex puzzle chamber, set by the enigmatic CEO, Enigma (sentences 22-26).\n5. **Final Confrontation and Escape**: Emma and Jake solve the final puzzle, triggering the self-destruction of Sphinx Corp's headquarters, and they escape, bringing an end to their dangerous mission (sentences 37-40).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Discovery of the Puzzle Chamber)**: Emma and Jake are in a state of fear, confusion, and vulnerability. They are trapped and must rely on their wits to survive.\n- **Event 2 (Escape from the Initial Puzzle Chamber)**: Their state improves significantly as they escape, feeling a sense of relief and accomplishment. However, they are also driven by a desire for justice, setting the stage for their next actions.\n- **Event 3 (Investigation and Discovery of Sphinx Corp)**: They are determined and proactive, taking control of their situation by investigating and planning. Their state is one of focused resolve.\n- **Event 4 (Infiltration of Sphinx Corp and Second Puzzle Chamber)**: Despite their preparations, they face a setback as they encounter another puzzle chamber, placing them in a state of heightened fear and urgency. However, their experience and bond help them tackle this challenge.\n- **Event 5 (Final Confrontation and Escape)**: Emma and Jake reach a peak state of determination and teamwork, successfully solving the final puzzle and escaping. They emerge victorious, having overcome their challenges and achieved their goal of bringing down Sphinx Corp.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc can be classified by analyzing the change in the protagonists' state throughout the narrative. Initially, Emma and Jake are in a dire situation (low point), then they improve their condition by escaping (rise), only to face another challenge (setback) when they infiltrate Sphinx Corp. However, they ultimately overcome this challenge as well, achieving a higher state than before by succeeding in their mission and finding justice (higher rise).\n\nThis pattern resembles the **Cinderella** story arc, where the protagonist rises, faces a setback, and ultimately achieves a higher state. The protagonists start in a vulnerable state, rise by escaping the first puzzle chamber, face a significant setback by encountering another deadly challenge, but ultimately achieve a higher state by solving the final puzzle, escaping, and bringing down Sphinx Corp.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To classify the story arc type, let's first identify the protagonist and 5 major events in the story.\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Emily Adams, as the narrative revolves around her actions and decisions.\n\nHere are 5 major events in the story:\n\n1. **Event 1: Introduction to the protagonist's world** ( sentences 1-5) - The story introduces Emily Adams, her father John, and their firm Ardon Capital, which is close to landing a significant client.\n2. **Event 2: The crisis unfolds** (sentences 6-11) - Whispers of corporate conspiracy and the rival firm Vortex Partners' involvement threaten Ardon Capital's deal.\n3. **Event 3: Emily launches her investigation** (sentences 10-14) - Emily starts her own investigation to reveal the truth behind the conspiracy, and her father faces mounting pressure from investors.\n4. **Event 4: Confrontation and revelation** (sentences 15-20) - Emily and John confront Robert, the CEO of Vortex Partners, and gather evidence of his deceit.\n5. **Event 5: Resolution and triumph** (sentences 21-41) - The truth about Robert's conspiracy is exposed, and Ardon Capital emerges victorious, with Emily and John receiving congratulations and praise.\n\nNow, let's analyze the protagonist's state at each event and how it changed relative to the previous events:\n\n- At **Event 1**, Emily is introduced in her father's shadow, with her firm on the verge of a significant success. Her state is one of potential and anticipation.\n- By **Event 2**, Emily's world is disrupted by the crisis, and her state becomes one of concern and suspicion. Her condition has worsened as she faces the challenge of saving her family's business.\n- At **Event 3**, Emily takes action by launching her investigation. Her state transitions from passive concern to active engagement, showing determination and initiative. Her condition starts to improve as she takes control of the situation.\n- During **Event 4**, Emily's investigation leads to a confrontation, and she successfully gathers evidence. Her state improves further as she achieves a significant victory, moving closer to resolving the crisis.\n- By **Event 5**, Emily's actions lead to the exposure of the conspiracy, and she emerges victorious alongside her father. Her state has improved significantly from the initial crisis, ending in a position of triumph and recognition.\n\nBased on this analysis, the story arc type can be classified by observing the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. Emily starts in a state of potential, faces a significant challenge (falling into a dilemma), and then finds a way out through her actions, ending in a better state than where she began.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story can be identified as Glen, given that the narrative revolves significantly around his experiences, perceptions, and interactions, especially with Cyndi and the unfolding mystery involving Art and the asylum.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. Glen's car runs over a spike strip, and he seeks refuge in Art and Cyndi's home (sentences 1-3).\n2. Art persuades Glen to sleep with Cyndi, which is later revealed to be a hypnotic suggestion (sentence 6).\n3. Glen discovers that he and Cyndi are patients in a mental asylum, and their interactions were part of their therapy or a result of hypnotic suggestions (sentence 11).\n4. Shannon helps Glen and Cyndi escape the asylum (sentence 20).\n5. Glen, Cyndi, and Shannon finally escape the asylum for good, but Glen remains partially in a trance (sentences 26-28).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Glen is in a vulnerable state, seeking refuge. His condition is one of need and dependency.\n- **Event 2**: Glen's state changes to one of compliance under hypnotic suggestion, indicating a loss of control over his actions. This event marks a significant downturn in his autonomy.\n- **Event 3**: The revelation about the asylum and hypnotic suggestions places Glen in a state of confusion and disorientation, realizing his perceptions were manipulated. This is a low point, as he understands he has been living under false pretenses.\n- **Event 4**: With Shannon's help, Glen and Cyndi escape, marking an improvement in Glen's state as he begins to gain freedom and potentially insight into his situation.\n- **Event 5**: Glen's final state is one of partial liberation, both physically from the asylum and psychologically from some of the hypnotic suggestions. However, he remains partially in a trance, indicating that while he has made progress, he is not fully recovered or in control.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. Glen starts in a vulnerable state, falls deeper into a situation where he loses control (under hypnotic suggestion), then hits a low point with the revelation about the asylum. He then experiences a rise as he escapes the asylum, but ends in a state that is somewhat improved yet still compromised (partially in a trance).\n\nThis pattern does not fit the \"Rags to Riches\" or \"Cinderella\" arcs, as Glen does not end in a significantly better state than where he started. It doesn't fit \"Riches to Rags\" since Glen does not start in a high-status position. The \"Man in a Hole\" and \"Double Man in a Hole\" arcs are also not perfect fits because Glen's escape and subsequent state do not indicate a complete recovery or a return to a better state than the beginning. The \"Icarus\" arc does not apply as Glen does not rise to a peak of success before falling.\n\nHowever, considering the Oedipus story arc type, which involves a protagonist who starts high, falls, recovers, and then faces another significant downfall, Glen's story can be seen to loosely fit this pattern if one considers his initial refuge-seeking state as a baseline, his descent into hypnotic manipulation as a fall, his escape as a recovery, and his final state of being partially in a trance as another downfall, albeit one that is part of a complex, ongoing struggle rather than a complete collapse.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identification of Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Sgt. Todd 3465, played by Kurt Russell. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Introduction to Project Adam and Todd's Background (Sentences 1-5)**: This event sets the stage for Todd's character, showcasing his upbringing and training as a soldier.\n2. **The Introduction of Genetically Engineered Soldiers and Todd's Defeat (Sentences 6-9)**: This marks a significant turning point where Todd faces a new, superior opponent and is defeated.\n3. **Todd's Survival on Arcadia 234 and Initial Integration with the Colonists (Sentences 13-18)**: After being left for dead, Todd finds himself on a waste disposal planet and begins to interact with a community of pacifists.\n4. **Todd's Flashbacks, Aggression, and Subsequent Exile from the Colony (Sentences 20-23)**: Todd starts experiencing flashbacks and nearly kills one of the colonists, leading to his exile from the colony.\n5. **The Final Confrontation with the Genetically Engineered Soldiers and Redemption (Sentences 28-40)**: This event involves Todd protecting the colonists from the new soldiers, leading to his redemption and a new purpose.\n\n### 2. Description of Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Todd is introduced as a hardened, disciplined soldier with no understanding of life outside military routine. His state is one of peak physical and mental conditioning but emotional numbness.\n- **Event 2**: After being defeated by Caine 607, Todd's state changes to one of vulnerability and obsolescence. He is no longer the superior soldier he once was.\n- **Event 3**: On Arcadia 234, Todd begins to show signs of humanity and attempts to integrate with the colonists. His state improves as he starts to form connections, albeit struggle with his past conditioning.\n- **Event 4**: With the onset of flashbacks and aggressive behavior, Todd's state deteriorates. He becomes a danger to the colony and is exiled, hitting a low point in his social and emotional journey.\n- **Event 5**: In the final confrontation, Todd finds redemption by protecting the colonists and defeating his enemies. His state improves significantly as he finds a new purpose and begins to embrace his humanity.\n\n### 3. Classification of Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc of Sgt. Todd 3465 can be classified based on the pattern of his condition throughout the story. Initially, Todd is at a peak in terms of his military prowess but lacks emotional depth. He then faces a downfall with his defeat and subsequent exile. However, he experiences a series of events that lead to his recovery and eventual redemption. This pattern of falling into a dilemma (defeat and exile) and then finding a way out (redemption and new purpose) is characteristic of a specific story arc type.\n\nGiven the description of the story arcs provided, Todd's journey fits the **Double Man in a Hole** story arc type because he faces two significant cycles of dilemma and recovery. First, he faces a physical and professional dilemma with his defeat and obsolescence, and then an emotional and social dilemma with his exile from the colony. Both times, he manages to recover and improve his condition, culminating in his final act of redemption and newfound purpose.\n\n### 4. Determined Story Arc Type\n\nDouble Man in a Hole"

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Jane Doe, an immensely dedicated critical care nurse who is secretly struggling with chronic and debilitating heart disease.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. Jane's discovery of a hushed conversation between two hospital administrators (sentence 6), which introduces uncertainty into her life.\n2. Jane suffers a sudden onset cardiac crisis (sentence 10), highlighting the severity of her health condition.\n3. The retired attorney offers to help Jane, providing her with legal aid and friendship (sentence 13), which marks a turning point in her struggle against the hospital.\n4. Jane is wrongfully terminated from her job (sentence 20), leading to a significant low point in her life.\n5. The judgment in the lawsuit against the city hospital is announced, finding the hospital guilty of blatant health discrimination (sentence 25), which is a peak moment in Jane's fight for justice.\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **Event 1 (Discovery of Conversation):** Jane's state changes from one of fragile equilibrium to uncertainty and fear. This event introduces a dilemma into her life, making her state worse than before.\n2. **Event 2 (Cardiac Crisis):** Jane's state deteriorates further as her health condition is exacerbated, showing how her physical health is failing, making her condition worse.\n3. **Event 3 (Offer of Help):** With the offer of legal aid and friendship from the retired attorney, Jane's state improves slightly as she gains support and a means to fight back against the hospital, indicating a potential for recovery.\n4. **Event 4 (Wrongful Termination):** Jane's state hits a low point as she loses her job, which is not only a financial blow but also a significant emotional and professional setback, making her condition worse again.\n5. **Event 5 (Judgment in Lawsuit):** Although this event marks a victory for Jane in her legal battle, her health has markedly declined (as mentioned later in the story), indicating that while her legal and social standing might have improved, her physical condition has worsened.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nTo classify the story arc, we need to analyze the pattern of the protagonist's condition throughout the story. The story starts with Jane in a difficult situation, struggling with her health and hiding it from her colleagues. She then faces a series of challenges (discovery of the conversation, cardiac crisis) that worsen her state before receiving help from the retired attorney, which slightly improves her situation. However, she then faces another significant setback (wrongful termination) before achieving a legal victory. Despite this victory, her health declines, leading to her death.\n\nGiven this pattern, the story does not follow a straightforward \"Rags to Riches,\" \"Riches to Rags,\" \"Man in a Hole,\" \"Icarus,\" or \"Cinderella\" arc. Instead, Jane faces multiple cycles of downturns and slight recoveries, with her condition overall trending downward due to her health, despite her legal successes. This pattern resembles the \"Double Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist faces two cycles of dilemma and recovery, but with an ultimate decline in the protagonist's physical condition despite achieving some form of victory or resolution.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story can be considered as Albert Bennett, given that the narrative's progression and climax heavily revolve around his past, decisions, and ultimate fate. However, it's also plausible to consider Amelia as the protagonist due to her proactive role in uncovering the truth and her emotional journey throughout the story. For the purpose of this analysis, let's consider Albert as the primary protagonist, with a focus on how his condition changes throughout the story.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. **The decision to move to the Gothic mansion** (Sentence 5) - This marks a significant change in Albert's life, driven by his attempt to escape his past.\n2. **The family's encounter with the mansion's eerie presence** (Sentence 11) - This event signifies the beginning of supernatural experiences that affect Albert's family and his own mental state.\n3. **Amelia's discovery of the mansion's dark history and its connection to Albert's past** (Sentence 18) - This revelation escalates the tension within the family and forces Albert to confront his secrets.\n4. **Albert's admission of his involvement in a crime** (Sentence 23) - This is a turning point where Albert's past catches up with him, leading to severe consequences.\n5. **The climax where Albert yields his life to the vengeful spirit** (Sentence 27) - This event marks the ultimate downfall of Albert, resulting from his past actions and the haunted mansion's influence.\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1 (Decision to move):** Albert is attempting to escape his haunting past, suggesting he is in a state of distress or unease. His decision to move can be seen as an attempt to improve his condition, indicating a desire for a better life.\n- **Event 2 (Encounter with the eerie presence):** Albert's state begins to deteriorate as the supernatural events start affecting his family, causing tension and fear. This marks a decline in his condition compared to his initial attempt to start anew.\n- **Event 3 (Discovery of the mansion's dark history):** Albert's condition worsens as his past is uncovered, and the connection between his secrets and the mansion's history becomes apparent. This leads to increased tension within the family and guilt for Albert.\n- **Event 4 (Admission of involvement in a crime):** Albert's state reaches a low point as he is forced to confront the consequences of his actions. This admission signifies a complete breakdown of his composed demeanor and a realization of his downfall.\n- **Event 5 (Climax and death):** Albert's condition ends in tragedy, with him yielding his life to atone for his past mistakes. This is the lowest point in his journey, marking a significant decline from his initial state as a successful businessman.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the progression of Albert's condition, the story arc can be classified based on how his state changes from the beginning to the end. Initially, Albert is in a position of success and attempts to better his life by moving away from his past. However, his condition continuously worsens as his past mistakes catch up with him, leading to a tragic end. This pattern does not fit the \"Rags to Riches,\" \"Man in a Hole,\" \"Cinderella,\" or \"Double Man in a Hole\" story arcs, as those typically involve an improvement in the protagonist's condition at some point. Instead, Albert's story is one of continuous downfall after the initial attempt to escape his past, which aligns more closely with the \"Icarus\" or \"Riches to Rags\" story arcs. However, since Albert's starting point is already one of success and his journey is marked by a decline into tragedy without a significant rise in between, the \"Riches to Rags\" classification seems more appropriate.\n\n### 4.

They create a catastrophe in space and are flung into a black hole by Serena (sentences 5-8).\n4. They emerge in Galveston in 2022 and meet intelligent versions of themselves who explain they must enter a portal to prevent the destruction of the multiverse (sentences 9-11).\n5.

Describe the protagonist's state and how it changed relative to the previous events\n\n- At event 1, Beavis and Butt-Head are in trouble for burning down their school, indicating a low point.\n- At event 2, they are given an opportunity to train as astronauts, which is a significant improvement from their initial situation, indicating a rise in their condition.\n- At event 3, they face a drastic downfall as they are flung into space and then into a black hole, which is a much worse situation than their initial trouble.\n- At event 4, they find themselves in a new and unfamiliar world (2022) with a critical mission, which, despite the challenges, presents them with a unique adventure and potentially a path to redemption or success, indicating another rise in their condition.\n- At event 5, despite failing in their mission to save the multiverse themselves, the multiverse is saved, and they are rewarded with their home, indicating a final improvement in their condition.\n\n### 3. Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain your reasoning\n\nThe story arc can be classified as a \"Man in a Hole\" type because Beavis and Butt-Head start in a disadvantaged situation (burning down their school), then rise to a unique opportunity (becoming astronauts), fall into a catastrophic situation (being flung into a black hole), and finally end up in a better situation than where they started (being given their home back and having a unique experience). This pattern of falling into a dilemma and then finding a way out, ending better than at the beginning, aligns with the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc.\n\n### 4.

Describe the protagonist's state at each event and how it changed\n\n- **Event 1**: Annabel's state is one of stability and happiness living with her grandfather and having Mitzy as her best friend.

Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout\n\nThe story arc of Annabel can be seen as a journey where she faces a dilemma (the custody battle and being forced to leave her home), falls into a deeper problem (running away and the physical danger), and then finds a way out, ending in a better state than she was initially (being reunited with her loved ones and having her grandparents reconcile with her and Jonah). This pattern fits the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist's condition worsens before improving, as Annabel's situation deteriorates significantly before ultimately resolving in a positive manner.\n\n### 4.

His state changes from confidence to submission.\n- **Event 2**: Hal tries to assert his new lifestyle and distance himself from Rebecca, indicating a attempt to regain control. His state changes from submission back to an attempt at dominance.\n- **Event 3**: Hal's attempt at control is shattered by Rebecca's blackmail, leading to rage and humiliation. His state worsens, moving from attempted dominance back to a deeper submission and emotional distress.\n- **Event 4**: Hal hits a low point, realizing he cannot control Rebecca or the situation, and is forced into sexual acts against his will. His state is one of utter despair and loss of control.\n- **Event 5**: Through the roleplay, Hal finds a form of resolution and a new path forward with Rebecca, suggesting a reconciliation and a new dynamic in their relationship. His state improves, moving from despair to a form of acceptance and newfound understanding.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\nGiven the protagonist's condition throughout the story, it starts with Hal in a powerful position (about to become CEO), faces significant challenges and humiliations (especially during the blackmail and sexual coercion), and ends with a form of resolution and a new path forward. This pattern does not fit the \"Rags to Riches\" or \"Riches to Rags\" perfectly because Hal's journey is more complex, involving falls and recoveries. It doesn't fit \"Icarus\" because Hal doesn't rise to a peak of success before falling. The closest match is the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc because Hal falls into a deep dilemma (blackmail, humiliation, loss of control) but finds a way out through the final roleplay, ending in a better state than his lowest point. However, considering the complexities and the double cycle of dilemma and recovery (first, the initial submission and attempt to regain control, and second, the deeper fall into despair and the final recovery through the roleplay), it might also suggest elements of a \"Double Man in a Hole\" or a nuanced \"Cinderella\" story arc where the protagonist faces setbacks but ultimately achieves a higher state of being or understanding.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identify the protagonist and 5 major events in the story\n\nThe protagonist in the story is Carla Dempsey, a high-profile lawyer. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. Carla discovers a concealed, dusty-old letter revealing she was adopted from a family deeply entrenched in LA's nefarious underworld (sentence 7).\n2. Carla confronts her father about her adoption and learns about her biological parents' involvement with the East LA Bratva (sentence 11).\n3. Liam is abducted by an ominous figure thought to be a disgruntled member of the crime syndicate (sentence 21).\n4. Carla discovers that her biological parents were innocents, callously framed by their treacherous 'friends' in the syndicate, and she confronts the syndicate to secure Liam's release (sentences 25-28).\n5. Carla and Liam join forces with Sergeant Martinez's LAPD squad to dismantle the shadowy syndicate and ultimately succeed in their mission (sentences 31-38).\n\n### 2. Describe the protagonist's state and how it changed at each event\n\n- **Event 1 (Discovery of adoption):** Carla's state changes from one of blissful ignorance to shock and confusion. She moves from a state of high emotional stability to one of turmoil.\n- **Event 2 (Confrontation with father):** Carla's state transitions from confusion to a deeper understanding of her past, but also to feelings of betrayal and identity crisis. Her emotional stability decreases further as she grapples with her new reality.\n- **Event 3 (Liam's abduction):** Carla's state deteriorates significantly as she moves from a place of personal crisis to one of desperation and fear for her loved one. This is a low point for her.\n- **Event 4 (Rescue and confrontation):** Carla's state shows a marked improvement as she transitions from desperation to determination and action. She exhibits courage and resolve, indicating a rise in her emotional and psychological state.\n- **Event 5 (Success against the syndicate):** Carla's state reaches a new high as she and Liam succeed in their mission. She moves from a place of personal and relationship turmoil to one of resolution, strength, and a newfound sense of purpose.\n\n### 3. Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain the reasoning\n\nThe story arc of Carla Dempsey can be classified based on how her condition changes throughout the narrative. Initially, Carla is in a high state, enjoying a successful career and a loving relationship. The discovery of her adoption and the subsequent abduction of Liam represent significant downturns in her state, placing her in a \"hole\" of sorts. However, each time she faces a dilemma, she finds a way out, ending better than she was before. This pattern of falling into a problem and then recovering, only to face another challenge and recover again, suggests a specific story arc type.\n\nGiven that Carla faces two major cycles of dilemma and recovery (first, the crisis of identity and family secrets, and second, the abduction of Liam and the confrontation with the syndicate), and ends in a better state than where she began (with a stronger relationship, a new purpose, and personal growth), the story arc aligns with the characteristics of a **Double Man in a Hole**. This classification fits because Carla experiences two distinct periods of decline followed by recovery and growth, ultimately emerging stronger and in a better position than at the start of the story.\n\n### 4.

Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Discovery of the Diary**: Jane finds a worn-out leather-bound diary on the beach, which contains the experiences of a soldier named Thomas Hawkins (sentence 4).\n2. **Emotional Investment**: Jane becomes deeply emotional and invested in Thomas's story, feeling a torrent of emotions as she reads about his experiences in the war (sentence 7).\n3. **Investigation Begins**: Jane starts her investigation to uncover more about Thomas's life, visiting municipal libraries and provincial record offices (sentence 10).\n4. **Breakthrough and Completion**: Jane and Robert Griffiths, a war veteran, finally manage to complete the puzzle of Thomas's life after relentless efforts (sentence 16).\n5. **Tribute and Reflection**: Jane pens a tribute to Thomas for 'The Sussex Chronicle' and, along with Robert, pays their respects at Thomas's memorial, deciding to keep his memory alive (sentences 17-20).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Discovery of the Diary)**: Jane's state is one of curiosity and intrigue. Her discovery sets her on a path of investigation and emotional investment.\n- **Event 2 (Emotional Investment)**: Jane's state shifts to one of deep emotional engagement. She is no longer just a curious columnist but is now personally affected by Thomas's story.\n- **Event 3 (Investigation Begins)**: Jane's state is proactive and determined. She transitions from being a passive reader to an active investigator, seeking to uncover more about Thomas.\n- **Event 4 (Breakthrough and Completion)**: Jane's state is one of accomplishment and satisfaction. She and Robert have successfully uncovered Thomas's story, completing the puzzle they set out to solve.\n- **Event 5 (Tribute and Reflection)**: Jane's state is reflective and honoring. She has not only completed her mission to tell Thomas's story but has also found a way to keep his memory alive, indicating a sense of closure and fulfillment.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on Jane's condition throughout the story, it's evident that she starts in a state of peace and reflection, faces a challenge or dilemma (the emotional investment in Thomas's story and the quest to uncover more about him), and then finds a way out of this dilemma by successfully telling Thomas's story and finding closure. This pattern fits the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma and finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning. Jane's journey from curiosity to emotional investment, to proactive investigation, to accomplishment, and finally to reflection and honoring, shows a progression from a lower state (of not knowing Thomas's story) to a higher state (of understanding and honoring it).\n\n### 4.

occupation.\n2) Running a thriving car dealership, he shares this venture and life's numerous pleasures and difficulties with his remarkably driven wife, Sarah.\n3) Their blissful existence unfolds against the pristine backdrop of Selton, a charmingly serene middle-class suburban neighborhood.\n4) This tight-knit community, with its verdant greenery, white picket fences, and friendly faces, is home to their trio of sparkling-eyed children; Lily, whose beautifully nimble fingers vividly bring alive any piano composition, Samuel who dominates lacrosse fields, and Zac, their youngest, whose infectious smile can brighten even the gloomiest of days.\n5) Everything seemed to follow a picturesque rhythm till one unusually warm Wednesday.\n6) Tom noticed a large, luminously painted moving van blocking their once-tranquil street.\n7) The van, plastered with cheerful imagery and parked in front of the Victorian style house next door, caused Tom a hint of anxiety.\n8) Lo and behold, this anxiety magnified into a feeling of discomfort and dread once he discovered that the new occupants of the neighboring house were none other than his high school nemesis, Dan.\n9) A former local football legend, Dan had always been known for his cocksure attitude and reputation for thriving in rivalries.\n10) Every casual interaction with Dan since then seemed soaked with an underlying animosity.\n11) Be it chance meetings at parental school functions or during the neighbor's backyard barbeque get-togethers, their conversations were invariably simmering with unsaid rivalry, hidden behind false smiles and forced laughter.\n12) More disconcertingly, Tom comes to realize that Dan's return isn't merely a personal upset, but also a professional threat.\n13) Dan, now a dealer specializing in coveted, high-end luxury vehicles, was not-hesitating to indirectly disparage and undermine Tom\u2019s hard-earned business reputation.\n14) This festering relationship with Dan didn't just perturb Tom.\n15) It left him in a precarious spot when Dan began employing underhanded tactics, such as disseminating malicious rumors about Tom\u2019s professional credibility, to sabotage his business.\n16) Feeling progressively cornered by the unpleasant circumstances, Tom finally confided in Sarah during a quiet, reflective conversation over a peaceful evening embellished with their favorite coffee.\n17) Sarah, erudite, and shrewd, proposed a strategical approach to counteract these swirling controversies.\n18) She drew up a plan to host a grand neighborhood car show, a casual gathering yet a serious platform to showcase Tom's diverse and impressive array of vintage and modern vehicles.\n19) Thrilled yet anxious, the couple decided to use the pride of Selton, the Faith Park, a shared open space in the heart of their community, as the venue for this ambitious event.\n20) Parallelly, as the car show preparations brewed, Tom and Dan's petty antagonisms escalated during casual neighborhood gatherings.\n21) Their constant one-upmanship, which began as minor, harmless jabbing, started taking on more worrying undertones.\n22) Confronting and gradually overcoming this opposition had an overpoweringly positive effect on Tom.\n23) It steeled his resolve and strengthened his courage to weather any adverse winds that Dan seemed determined to conjure and blow his way.\n24) Finally, the much-awaited day of the car show dawned, albeit with ominous rain clouds roiling the sky.\n25) To add to the mounting stress, their star attraction, a suave 1930 Ford Model A Roadster, was nonchalantly refusing to start.\n26) Fearful for his professional image and credibility, Tom spent the morning under the temperamental car in a makeshift garage.\n27) With the determination of a warrior, armed with tools as his weapons, he warred with the Roadster's obstinacy.\n28) Amidst this electrifying chaos, baby Zac suddenly vanished.\n29) A wave of panic washed over the Harpers as they frantically began looking for their youngest.\n30) As it turns out, the little one was found cozily snuggled asleep inside the plush leather seats of a cherry-red 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air.\n31) This discovery resulted in collective sighs of relief and subsequent laughter rippling through the family.\n32) With all minor mishaps resolved, and the stubborn rain deciding to stay at bay, the Harpers finally kick-started their car show.\n33) It turned into a fanfare of beautiful automobiles ranging from an imposing Rolls Royce Phantom to an agelessly charming Volkswagen Beetle.\n34) Amidst all the glitz and gasps of awe, what stood out was Tom's impressive command over automobiles.\n35) His expertise clearly overshadowed the petty, underhanded tactics that Dan had engaged in, affirming Tom's status as Selton's undisputed autophile.\n36) The success story of the day was the unanticipated support and acceptance from the community.\n37) This overwhelming display of solidarity promptly dismissed Dan's attempts at sabotage and heartened a now-relieved Tom.\n38) This realization and reaffirmation of his credibility and position galvanized Tom's self-confidence.\n39) It helped him understand that his authentic passion, practical knowledge, and deep domain understanding were invaluable competencies that set him apart in the industry.\n40) In a surprising twist of the narrative, the once-ruthless Dan openly admitted his wrongdoings and praised Tom on his unparalleled collection, conceding defeat over his own luxury line-up.\n41) His unexpectedly candid and humble admittance was the finishing touch to the success of the car show, bringing a sense of closure and redemption to the narrative.\n42) As the days rolled into weeks, the neighborhood transformed as the bricks of antagonism fell apart.\n43) It was replaced by a bloom of improved relations and a shared sense of harmony.\n44) The metaphorical picket fences that had sprung up between the red brick houses and bespoke maple-lined streets of Selton had, at last, vanished.\n45) Reflecting on the event, Tom recognized his triumph was not in trouncing Dan, but in the growing closeness within his family, and the strength of their relationship with their supportive neighbors.\n46) The closing scene elegantly captures Selton at dusk, with twinkling fairy lights adorning the entire neighborhood, mirroring the canopy of glistening stars overhead.\n47) The Harper family, stronger than ever, looked towards this future, filled with hope and excitement.\n48) Their journey, undeniably difficult, had ultimately been one of collective growth and unity.\n49) As fading laughter and lingering cheers accompanied a warm sense of fulfillment, the narrative underscored the fundamental values of unity, camaraderie, resilience, and the power to navigate and overcome adversities.\n50) The realization that their resilience and community support far overshadowed any vendetta brought a new perspective to their lives.\n51) It was a framework much stronger and more uplifting than what they had believed possible.\n52) Thus, the warmly twinkling lights of Selton faded out, leaving behind an elegant tapestry of suburban life - whimsical, joyful, and infinitely stronger together.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better

        "output": "To classify the story arc type, let's follow the instructions step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the protagonist and 5 major events in the story:**\n   - The protagonist of the story is Blink, an aspiring artist.\n   - Five major events in the story are:\n     1. Hurricane Katrina decimates New Orleans (Event 2).\n     2. Blink and his friends are denied FEMA aid and consider a life of crime (Events 5 and 6).\n     3. The group decides to rob a casino (Event 7) and faces a shootout, leading to Andre's death (Event 9).\n     4. Blink and his friends attempt to navigate the criminal underworld, seeking help from The Saint and facing off against Lorenzo Bass (Events 17 and 31).\n     5. The final confrontation and resolution, where Blink survives a shootout and later publishes his graphic novel (Events 38 and 39).\n\n2. **Describe the protagonist's state and how it changed at each event:**\n   - **Event 1 (Hurricane Katrina):** Blink's life is severely disrupted by the hurricane, placing him in a difficult situation. His state changes from preparing for a wedding to dealing with the aftermath of a disaster.\n   - **Event 2 (Denied FEMA aid and considering crime):** Blink's situation worsens as he is denied aid and considers illegal activities to improve his situation. His state changes from seeking legal help to contemplating criminal acts.\n   - **Event 3 (Casino robbery and Andre's death):** Blink's decision to engage in crime leads to significant danger and loss, as his friend Andre is killed. His state changes from attempting to improve his situation through crime to facing the severe consequences of those actions.\n   - **Event 4 (Navigating the criminal underworld):** Blink and his friends face more dangers and challenges as they deal with criminal figures. His state remains precarious, with a constant threat of violence and legal repercussions.\n   - **Event 5 (Final confrontation and resolution):** Despite the risks, Blink survives and eventually publishes his graphic novel, achieving a long-held dream. His state changes from being embroiled in crime and danger to finding success and redemption through his art.\n\n3. **Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain the reasoning:**\n   - The story arc can be classified by examining how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the narrative. Initially, Blink faces significant challenges (Hurricane Katrina, denial of FEMA aid), which leads him to make risky decisions (engaging in criminal activity). He experiences a rise in his situation when he navigates the criminal underworld and eventually finds a way out through his art. However, this rise is preceded by a drastic fall into criminal activity and followed by a dangerous confrontation that could have ended in his death. The key characteristic of Blink's story is that he starts in a disadvantaged position, rises to a point of significant risk and challenge, faces a potential downfall, but ultimately ends in a better position than where he started, having found success and redemption.\n   - The story does not follow a simple **Rags to Riches** arc because Blink's path is marked by significant setbacks and dangers, including the death of a friend and his involvement in criminal activities. It's not **Riches to Rags** because Blink does not start in a high-status position. **Man in a Hole** could be considered because Blink falls into a dilemma (involvement in crime) and finds a way out (through his art), but this doesn't fully capture the complexity of his rise and fall. **Icarus** fits because Blink rises to a point of success (navigating the criminal underworld and eventually publishing his novel) but faces a drastic downfall (the dangerous confrontations and the death of his friends), and while he ends in a better state, the journey is marked by significant risks and challenges. **Double Man in a Hole** and **Cinderella** do not perfectly fit because Blink's story does not involve two clear cycles of dilemma and recovery or a simple rise, setback, and ultimate achievement without the deep involvement in criminal activity and its consequences. **Oedipus** also does not fit because Blink does not start in a high position and then fall; instead, he starts low and faces challenges as he rises.\n\n4. **Determined story arc type:**\nIcarus"

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist in the story is Benjamin Mortimer, a former detective. Five major events in the story can be identified as follows:\n\n1. **The Arrival of the Enigmatic Letter**: Benjamin receives a letter asking for his help in investigating the death of a cadet, Samuel King.\n2. **The Investigation Begins**: Benjamin starts his investigation at the Royal Military Academy, despite facing scorn from the officers and trainees.\n3. **The Discovery of the Sinister Plot**: Benjamin discovers that Samuel's death might not be a suicide but a calculated homicide, and he faces intimidation and obstacles in his pursuit of truth.\n4. **The Formation of an Alliance and the Deepening Investigation**: Benjamin forms an alliance with Sarah, and together they uncover more evidence, including the symbol of 'The Scarlet Badge', which suggests a dark tradition within the academy.\n5. **The Final Confrontation and Revelation**: Benjamin and Sarah escape detention and confront the academy, revealing the truth about 'The Scarlet Badge' and bringing justice, which leads to Benjamin being hailed as a hero.\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1 (The Arrival of the Enigmatic Letter)**: Benjamin is in a state of solitude and oblivion, haunted by his past. The arrival of the letter interrupts his solitude and presents him with a challenge.\n- **Event 2 (The Investigation Begins)**: Benjamin's state changes as he decides to take on the case, showing determination despite initial reluctance. He faces opposition but is resolute.\n- **Event 3 (The Discovery of the Sinister Plot)**: Benjamin's condition worsens as he faces threats and intimidation, but his determination to uncover the truth strengthens.\n- **Event 4 (The Formation of an Alliance and the Deepening Investigation)**: With Sarah's help, Benjamin's state improves as he gains more insight into the case and finds support. However, the situation becomes more dangerous.\n- **Event 5 (The Final Confrontation and Revelation)**: Benjamin's condition significantly improves as he successfully uncovers the truth, brings the perpetrators to justice, and is hailed as a hero, overcoming his past demons.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the story. Initially, Benjamin is in a low state (haunted by his past and in solitude). As the story progresses, he faces challenges and his state worsens (facing scorn, intimidation, and danger). However, with each obstacle overcome, particularly with the help of Sarah and the progress in the investigation, his state improves. Ultimately, he ends in a much better state than where he started, having solved the case, found a sense of purpose, and been recognized as a hero.\n\nThis pattern follows the **Man in a Hole** story arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (Benjamin's investigation and the dangers that come with it) and finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning (solving the case and regaining his reputation).\n\n### 4.

This pattern aligns with a story arc where the protagonist's condition improves from the first turning point to the last turning point, despite facing setbacks along the way.\n\nThe determined story arc type is Rags to Riches."

Five major events in the story can be identified as follows:\n\n1. Eileen meets Rebecca Saint John, a new psychologist at the prison, and is drawn to her intellectual conversation and glamorous appearance (sentence 5-6).\n2. Rebecca invites Eileen to a local bar, and after a night of drinking and dancing, Rebecca kisses Eileen (sentence 9-10).\n3. Eileen learns that Rebecca has left for the Christmas holiday, but then receives a call from Rebecca inviting her to her house for drinks, which turns out to be the Polks' house (sentence 14-17).\n4. Eileen agrees to help Rebecca coerce Rita into admitting involvement in her son's abuse, and they drug Rita after she admits to enabling her husband's abuse (sentence 20-25).\n5. Eileen shoots Rita in the shoulder, and she and Rebecca plan to frame Jim for the shooting and run away together, but Rebecca betrays Eileen, leading to Eileen abandoning Rita in a remote forest (sentence 25-29).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: Eileen's state is one of isolation and longing. She is shunned by her colleagues and fantasizes about one of the guards, indicating a lack of fulfillment in her life. Meeting Rebecca brings a spark of interest and hope for connection.\n- **Event 2**: Eileen's state improves significantly as she experiences a night of freedom and connection with Rebecca. The kiss suggests a potential for romantic love and escape from her mundane and abusive home life.\n- **Event 3**: Initially, Eileen is disappointed by Rebecca's departure, indicating a reliance on Rebecca for emotional support. However, the invitation to the Polks' house rekindles her hope for a connection with Rebecca, albeit under deceitful circumstances.\n- **Event 4**: Eileen's state becomes more morally compromised as she participates in coercing Rita. Despite this, her actions are motivated by her desire to be with Rebecca, suggesting she is in a state of desperation and willingness to do anything for love and escape.\n- **Event 5**: Eileen's state reaches a peak of desperation and criminality. She shoots Rita and plans to frame her father, indicating a complete breakdown in her moral and legal boundaries. However, Rebecca's betrayal leads to Eileen's realization of her isolation and the depths of her actions, resulting in her abandoning Rita and leaving town, which can be seen as a form of escape or hitting rock bottom.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc can be classified by examining the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. Initially, Eileen is in a low state, feeling isolated and unfulfilled. She then experiences an improvement in her state with the introduction of Rebecca and their initial interactions. However, as the story progresses, Eileen becomes increasingly entangled in morally questionable and criminal activities, driven by her desire for Rebecca and escape from her life. The climax of the story involves Eileen hitting a low point morally and legally but then taking action (abandoning Rita and leaving) that can be seen as a form of liberation or escape from her situation.\n\nGiven these observations, the story does not fit neatly into the traditional \"Rags to Riches\" or \"Riches to Rags\" arc, as Eileen's condition does fluctuate but ends in a state that is arguably more liberated, albeit through questionable means. It also doesn't fit the \"Icarus\" arc perfectly because Eileen starts low, rises with Rebecca's influence, falls with the moral compromises, but ends in a state that is more about escape than downfall. The \"Man in a Hole\" arc seems closest because Eileen falls into a dilemma (her involvement with Rebecca's plans and her own moral compromises) and finds a way out (by abandoning Rita and leaving town), ending in a state that could be considered better than her starting point, given her escape from her abusive father and unfulfilling life.\n\n### 4.

However, through his actions and determination, Morrison not only recovers from these setbacks but also achieves a higher state of being than where he started (becoming a national hero, overcoming alcoholism, and finding redemption).\n\nThis pattern does not fit the **Rags to Riches** arc perfectly because Morrison starts in a relatively high position (though with personal struggles). It also doesn't fit **Riches to Rags** since he ends in a better state than he began. The **Man in a Hole** arc is closer because Morrison falls into a dilemma (job loss, alcoholism, personal threats) and then finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning. However, considering the complexity of his journey, which involves not just a fall and a rise but also a transformation from a private struggle to public recognition and redemption, it suggests elements beyond a simple recovery.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identify the protagonist and 5 major events in the story\n\nThe protagonist in the story is Special Agent Johnson. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. **Receiving the distress call** (sentence 3): This marks the beginning of the agents' journey into the mystery.\n2. **Arriving at The Final Stop and discovering the slaughter** (sentence 9): This event sets the tone for the horror and mystery that Johnson and Martinez are about to uncover.\n3. **Discovering the ancient tome and learning about the pub's role as an arcane gateway** (sentence 21): This revelation significantly escalates the stakes and introduces a supernatural element to the story.\n4. **Martinez's self-sacrifice** (sentence 40): This is a pivotal moment in the story, marking a significant emotional and plot turn.\n5. **Johnson's escape and the sealing of the portal** (sentence 46): This event concludes the main conflict of the story and sets the stage for the aftermath.\n\n### 2. Describe the protagonist's state at each event and how it changed\n\n1. **Receiving the distress call**: Johnson is introduced as a seasoned but weary veteran, carrying the weight of many horrific cases. His state is one of professional readiness but personal cynicism.\n2. **Arriving at The Final Stop and discovering the slaughter**: Johnson's state shifts to one of deep unsettlement and professional engagement. The horror of the scene deepens his emotional investment in the case.\n3. **Discovering the ancient tome and learning about the pub's role**: Johnson's skepticism is challenged by the introduction of supernatural elements. His state becomes one of escalating concern and disbelief, forcing him to consider possibilities beyond his experience.\n4. **Martinez's self-sacrifice**: This event profoundly affects Johnson, introducing a deep sense of loss and guilt. His state becomes one of anguish and determination to see the mission through to its end.\n5. **Johnson's escape and the sealing of the portal**: Johnson emerges victorious but scarred. His state is one of relief mixed with the trauma of his experiences. He is forever changed by the events, his cynicism possibly deepened by the loss of his partner and the supernatural horrors he faced.\n\n### 3. Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain the reasoning\n\nThe story arc of Agent Johnson can be seen as following the **Oedipus** pattern. Initially, Johnson is in a position of professional strength and experience (high point), albeit with personal cynicism. As the story progresses and he delves deeper into the mystery, he faces significant challenges and horrors (fall), particularly with the introduction of supernatural elements that test his worldview. The discovery of the ancient tome and the true nature of The Final Stop represents a point of no return, deepening his fall into the heart of horror. Martinez's sacrifice marks a low point (recovery/fall), where Johnson must come to terms with loss and find the strength to proceed. Finally, Johnson's escape and the sealing of the portal can be seen as a recovery (high point after the fall), but one that is bittersweet due to the trauma and loss he has endured. However, considering the overall trajectory and the fact that Johnson ends the story haunted and alone, having faced a drastic downfall in terms of his personal loss and the shattering of his worldview, it aligns more closely with the **Oedipus** story arc, where the protagonist starts high, falls, and then faces another significant downfall or ends in a state of tragedy or loss.\n\n### 4.

Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Carmen learns about Zack and Ivy's kidnapping**: This is the inciting incident that sets the story in motion.\n2. **Carmen's attempt to rescue Zack and Ivy from the van**: This event shows Carmen's immediate reaction to the kidnapping and her willingness to take risks.\n3. **Carmen's decision to steal for V.I.L.E.**: This marks a turning point where Carmen decides to comply with V.I.L.E.'s demands in hopes of saving her friends.\n4. **Carmen's success or failure in stealing the requested items**: This event (or series of events) determines the progression of the story and the fate of Zack and Ivy.\n5. **Carmen's final attempt to rescue Zack and Ivy**: This is the climax of the story, where Carmen's decisions and actions lead to the conclusion.\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Carmen is in a state of urgency and concern for her friends. Her condition is one of disadvantage due to the kidnapping.\n- **Event 2**: If Carmen attempts to rescue Zack and Ivy and fails (as the van is a ploy), her condition worsens as she is forced to comply with V.I.L.E.'s demands, indicating a low point.\n- **Event 3**: By deciding to steal for V.I.L.E., Carmen's condition slightly improves as she sees a potential way to save her friends, though she is still in a difficult situation.\n- **Event 4**: The outcome of Carmen's missions (success or failure) directly affects her state. Successes improve her condition as she gets closer to saving Zack and Ivy, while failures worsen it, potentially leading to their brainwashing.\n- **Event 5**: In the final attempt, if Carmen succeeds in rescuing Zack and Ivy (especially with the help of trusted allies like Julia), her condition improves significantly, ending on a high note.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the progression of Carmen's condition throughout the story, it starts with a disadvantage (kidnapping of friends), falls to a lower point (failure in initial rescue attempt and being forced to work for V.I.L.E.), and then improves as Carmen navigates through the challenges and finally succeeds in rescuing her friends. This pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist faces a dilemma, finds a way out through their actions, and ends in a better state than at the beginning.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Emily, a 12-year-old girl who navigates through a series of supernatural and terrifying events involving the \"black-eyed kids\" or Jungspar.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. **Event 1**: Emily experiences bullying and social exclusion at school, and strange encounters begin to happen around her (Sentences 5-8).\n2. **Event 2**: Emily's friend Christopher's sister, Jessie, goes missing after an encounter with the hooded, black-eyed assailants, prompting Emily and Christopher to investigate (Sentences 32-37).\n3. **Event 3**: Emily and Christopher learn about the Jungspar from Mr. Munch, an elderly man who has knowledge about these alien-like humanoids and their intentions (Sentences 45-55).\n4. **Event 4**: Emily, along with a group of other characters, attempts to rescue the abducted individuals by confronting the Jungspar in the forest, leading to a series of intense and dangerous encounters (Sentences 59-63).\n5. **Event 5**: Emily, with the help of Harold, rescues the abducted kids, including Christopher, and defeats the Jungspar, leading to a resolution where Emily and her family are hailed as heroes (Sentences 68-85).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **At Event 1**: Emily is in a vulnerable state, facing bullying and feeling isolated. Her condition is low due to her social situation and the onset of supernatural events.\n- **At Event 2**: Emily's concern and fear increase as those around her start to disappear. Her condition worsens as she feels more threatened and involved in the mysterious events.\n- **At Event 3**: Emily gains knowledge about the Jungspar, which empowers her to some extent but also increases her fear and sense of danger. Her condition slightly improves due to newfound understanding but remains precarious.\n- **At Event 4**: Emily takes action, facing her fears and the Jungspar directly. Although she experiences setbacks and dangers, her determination and bravery slightly improve her condition despite the immediate risks.\n- **At Event 5**: Emily successfully rescues her friends and defeats the Jungspar, leading to a significant improvement in her condition. She is no longer in immediate danger, and her actions have led to a positive outcome, earning her recognition and respect.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, Emily starts in a disadvantaged situation (facing bullying and supernatural threats), falls into a deeper dilemma (as the threats escalate and people around her disappear), and then finds a way out (by gaining knowledge, taking action, and eventually defeating the Jungspar). This pattern reflects a story arc where the protagonist faces challenges, hits a low point, and then recovers to a better state than where they started.\n\nThe story arc type that best fits this description is the **Double Man in a Hole** because Emily faces two significant cycles of falling into danger and recovering: the first cycle involves her initial vulnerabilities and the escalation of the Jungspar threat, and the second cycle involves her active confrontation with the threat and her eventual victory. However, given the overall trend from a low point to a higher point, with the protagonist overcoming significant challenges to achieve a better state, it more closely aligns with a **Man in a Hole** story arc when considering the broad strokes of Emily's journey from vulnerability to heroism.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To classify the story arc type, let's break down the story into its key components.\n\n### 1. Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story can be considered as the group of teenagers, including Steven, Alex, Lisa, and the Anderson siblings (Mark, George, Henry, and Jennifer), as the story revolves around their collective experiences and actions. However, if we were to pinpoint a central figure, Jennifer emerges as a key protagonist due to her pivotal role in the climax of the story.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. **The Discovery of the Antique Lantern**: The Anderson siblings find an antique, Victorian-style lantern in their attic, which sparks their curiosity and leads to the unfolding of the story's events (sentence 6).\n2. **The Activation of the Temporal Portal**: The siblings, by manipulating the lantern, inadvertently activate a temporal portal, bringing two time travelers and later, futuristic creatures into their world (sentences 10-12).\n3. **The Realization of the Catastrophe**: The time travelers inform the group about an imminent disastrous event threatening Riverdale, prompting the teenagers to take action (sentences 20-22).\n4. **The Battle Against the Futuristic Creatures**: The group faces off against the invading androids and half-human, half-robotic creatures, leading to a climax where Jennifer plays a crucial role in manipulating the temporal device to send the invaders back (sentences 32-40).\n5. **The Resolution and Victory**: The teenagers, with the guidance of the time travelers, successfully defeat the invaders, save their town, and then decide to keep their adventure a secret, bonding over their shared experience (sentences 41-48).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1 (Discovery of the Lantern)**: The protagonist (Jennifer and her siblings) is in a state of curiosity and excitement, looking for ways to enhance their DIY film project. Their state is one of innocence and anticipation.\n- **Event 2 (Activation of the Temporal Portal)**: The protagonist's state shifts to one of shock, fear, and confusion as they encounter the time travelers and the futuristic creatures. This marks a significant downturn in their state, moving from a carefree and creative mindset to one of peril.\n- **Event 3 (Realization of the Catastrophe)**: The realization of an impending disaster deepens the protagonist's state of fear and anxiety but also sparks a sense of determination and responsibility. They begin to transition from victims to heroes.\n- **Event 4 (Battle Against the Futuristic Creatures)**: During the battle, the protagonist's state is one of intense fear, panic, and determination. They are fighting for their town's safety and their own lives. This is the lowest point for the protagonist, as they face their greatest challenge.\n- **Event 5 (Resolution and Victory)**: After successfully defeating the invaders and saving their town, the protagonist's state changes to one of relief, pride, and a sense of accomplishment. They have overcome their fears and the challenges, emerging victorious and more united than ever.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, we observe a pattern where the protagonist starts in a relatively positive state (curiosity and excitement), falls into a dilemma (fear, confusion, and peril), and then finds a way out, ending in a better state than where they began (relief, pride, and accomplishment). This pattern aligns with the **Man in a Hole** story arc, where the protagonist faces a significant problem, hits a low point, and then recovers, emerging stronger or in a better situation than before.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is John McCallister, a striving thriller writer. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. John decides to take the job as a winter caretaker for the isolated hotel \"Wintertide\" (sentence 3).\n2. John starts experiencing strange and sinister occurrences at Wintertide (sentence 7).\n3. John delves into the grim history of Wintertide and begins writing \"Echoes of Wintertide\" (sentence 9).\n4. John's sanity begins to deteriorate as he becomes more entangled in the supernatural events at Wintertide (sentence 13).\n5. John goes missing, and his wife Daisy finds his unfinished manuscript, deciding to complete it herself (sentences 20-23).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1:** At the beginning, John is plagued by a career marred with failure but sees an opportunity in taking the caretaker job. His state is one of hope and potential for change.\n- **Event 2:** As John experiences strange occurrences, his state shifts to one of growing fear and unease. This is a decline from his initial hopeful state.\n- **Event 3:** John becomes more engaged with the mysterious events, using them as inspiration for his writing. His state is one of determination and creativity, which can be seen as an improvement or a peak in his condition compared to the fear and uncertainty of the previous event.\n- **Event 4:** John's sanity starts to slip, and he is consumed by fear and isolation. This represents a significant decline in his state, worse than at the beginning of the story.\n- **Event 5:** John's disappearance and the aftermath, where his wife finds his manuscript and decides to complete it, signify the lowest point for John. His state is one of complete loss and despair, as he is no longer present and his work is left unfinished.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. John starts in a disadvantaged situation (a career marred with failure), then rises to a point of potential success and creativity (using the strange events as inspiration for his writing), but ultimately faces a drastic downfall (his sanity slips, and he disappears). This pattern follows the Icarus story arc, where the protagonist rises to success but then faces a significant downfall.\n\nThe reasoning behind this classification is as follows:\n- **Initial State:** John is at a low point in his career and personal life.\n- **Rise:** He finds an opportunity that could change his life and even experiences a creative peak as he writes \"Echoes of Wintertide.\"\n- **Fall:** Despite this rise, John's situation drastically worsens as he succumbs to the supernatural forces and loses his grip on reality, culminating in his disappearance.\n\n### 4.

His state at this point is one of relief and triumph.\n- **At the fifth event (the aftermath)**: Jack's state is one of reflection and new beginnings. He has not only rescued his son but has also found a way to help other victims and create a positive legacy from his ordeal.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, we can observe that Jack starts in a relatively good state (living a quiet life), falls into a deep hole (his son's kidnapping and the subsequent discovery of the sinister plot), and then finds a way out through his actions and determinations, ultimately ending in a better state than where he began (having rescued his son, stopped the evil corporation, and found a new purpose in life).\n\nThis pattern fits the **Man in a Hole** story arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma but finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning. The key characteristics of this arc are present: an initial fall into a problem (the kidnapping), a struggle to address the problem (discovering the truth and assembling a team), and a successful resolution that leads to a better outcome (rescuing the children and creating a sanctuary).\n\n### 4.

Despite facing setbacks, Kelly ultimately succeeds in her mission, leading to a significant improvement in her condition.\n\nThis pattern resembles the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (the abduction of Jacob and the realization of the monsters' existence) but then finds a way out, ending in a better state than at the beginning. Kelly's journey from being haunted by her past and known as \"Monster Girl\" to becoming a hero who defeats the Boogeyman and earns recognition aligns with this arc.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To analyze the story arc, let's first identify the protagonist and major events in the story.\n\n1. **Protagonist Identification and Major Events:**\n   - The protagonist of the story is Michael Ausiello.\n   - Five major events in the story are:\n     1. Michael meets Kit Cowan at a gay nightclub (sentence 2).\n     2. Kit comes out to his parents and reveals Michael as his boyfriend (sentence 10).\n     3. Michael and Kit develop complications in their relationship, leading to a separation (sentence 19).\n     4. Kit is diagnosed with a rare form of stage-4 neuroendocrine cancer (sentence 21).\n     5. Kit's death and Michael's reflection on their life together (sentences 29-37).\n\n2. **Protagonist's State at Each Event:**\n   - **Event 1 (Meeting Kit):** Michael's state is one of potential and new beginnings. He has just met someone he connects with, which opens up possibilities for a relationship.\n   - **Event 2 (Kit Coming Out):** Michael's state improves as he is accepted by Kit's parents, indicating a deepening of their relationship and an overcoming of a significant hurdle.\n   - **Event 3 (Relationship Complications):** Michael's state worsens due to the complications in their relationship, including his own personal struggles with alcoholism and suspicions of infidelity. This marks a low point in their relationship.\n   - **Event 4 (Kit's Diagnosis):** Michael's state becomes one of concern and caregiving. He reconciles with Kit and supports him through his illness, showing a shift towards prioritizing their relationship and Kit's well-being.\n   - **Event 5 (Kit's Death):** Michael's state is one of grief and reflection. Despite the sadness of losing Kit, Michael reflects on the positive impact of their relationship on his life and the growth he experienced.\n\n3. **Story Arc Classification:**\n   The story arc can be classified by examining the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. The protagonist starts in a relatively positive state (meeting someone new), faces challenges and setbacks (relationship complications, Kit's illness), but ultimately ends in a state of reflection and growth, despite the tragic loss of his partner. This pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist falls into difficulties but finds a way to end in a better state than when he started, considering the personal growth and the fulfillment of his relationship with Kit.\n\n   The **Man in a Hole** story arc fits this description because Michael falls into a dilemma (relationship problems, dealing with Kit's illness and eventual death) but ends in a state of personal growth and appreciation for the life they built together, which is an improvement from his initial state of insecurity and fear of not being in a long-term relationship.\n\n4. **Determined Story Arc Type:**\nMan in a Hole"

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Arthur (Art), as the narrative primarily follows his journey and emotional transformations. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Event 1**: Art and his pregnant wife, Claire, visit his father, Saul, in Brooklyn (sentence 8).\n2. **Event 2**: Art's true intention for the visit is exposed by Heimish, revealing Art's financial struggles and his plan to ask his father to mortgage his house (sentence 26).\n3. **Event 3**: The demon kills Saul, marking a significant turning point in the story (sentence 28).\n4. **Event 4**: Art discovers the truth about Yosille's ritual and the demon Abyzou, understanding the gravity of the situation and the danger to his wife and unborn child (sentences 38-40).\n5. **Event 5**: Art sacrifices himself to trap the demon Abyzou, but ultimately dies after Heimish stabs him with the inscribed knife (sentences 54-58).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: Art's state is one of estrangement from his family and cultural roots, but he is attempting to reconnect, driven by a mix of genuine familial desire and ulterior motives (financial gain). His condition is somewhat stable, albeit with underlying tension.\n- **Event 2**: Art's state deteriorates as his true intentions are revealed, leading to confrontation and possibly damaging his relationship with his wife and father. His financial and personal struggles become more pronounced.\n- **Event 3**: With Saul's death, Art's state worsens significantly. He not only faces the loss of a family member but also the weight of his failed attempt to reconcile and seek help. The supernatural events start to escalate, further complicating his life.\n- **Event 4**: Art's understanding of the supernatural threat deepens, and he becomes determined to save his wife and child. While his situation is dire, his resolve strengthens, marking a moment of character growth amidst the chaos.\n- **Event 5**: Ultimately, Art's state culminates in sacrifice and death. Despite his bravery and the selfless act of saving his loved ones, his condition ends in tragedy, with him failing to survive the ritual to trap the demon.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the progression of Art's state throughout the story, it's clear that he starts in a somewhat stable but troubled condition, faces significant setbacks and challenges, and ultimately meets a tragic end. His condition worsens over time, especially after the first turning point, where his true intentions are exposed and the supernatural events begin to escalate. This pattern fits the **Riches to Rags** story arc, where the protagonist starts in a relatively high state (or at least with hopes and plans for improvement) but ends in a significantly lower state. Art's journey from attempting to reconnect with his family and solve his financial problems to sacrificing himself to save his loved ones from a demon marks a downward trajectory in his condition.\n\n### 4.

This pattern is characteristic of the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (or a \"hole\") and then finds a way out, ending up better than they were at the beginning. In this case, the siblings' journey out of their initial state of loss and disconnection leads them to a place of deeper understanding, connection, and contribution, which is a clear improvement over their starting point.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Liza, a resilient single mother working at the prestigious Solstice Law Firm. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. Liza meets Tom, a newly appointed partner, and they start interacting more often, discussing case files and engaging in legal banter (Events 5-8).\n2. Liza and Tom discover a personal connection at the annual office Christmas party, which blossoms into a friendship and later into a romantic relationship (Events 9-12).\n3. Liza finds a potent piece of evidence that could undermine their pro bono case, leading to a moral dilemma and a confrontation with Tom, which results in a strained relationship (Events 20-24).\n4. Liza passes her bar exam, becoming an attorney, but faces a setback when they lose the pro bono case, dealing a blow to the firm's reputation and her morale (Events 29-30, 26-28).\n5. Liza and Tom reconcile, appeal the pro bono case together, and achieve a legal victory, solidifying Liza's position as a strong attorney and strengthening their personal bond (Events 36-42).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: Liza's state is one of ambition and hard work, driven by her dream of becoming an attorney. Her interactions with Tom introduce a positive change, adding a personal connection to her professional life.\n- **Event 2**: Liza's state improves as she forms a personal connection with Tom, which adds a fulfilling dimension to her life beyond her professional ambitions.\n- **Event 3**: Liza's state worsens due to the moral dilemma and the confrontation with Tom, leading to a strained relationship and increased stress.\n- **Event 4**: Despite the setback of losing the pro bono case, Liza's state improves significantly with the news of passing her bar exam. This achievement is a turning point, validating her qualification and determination.\n- **Event 5**: Liza's state reaches a high point as she and Tom reconcile, win the appealed case, and she solidifies her position as a respected attorney. Her personal and professional life is balanced and fulfilling.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. Liza starts in a challenging situation as a single mother with ambitious dreams (not necessarily \"rags\" but a difficult situation). She faces setbacks and dilemmas, particularly with the strain in her relationship with Tom and the loss of the pro bono case. However, she consistently works towards her goals, and her condition improves significantly with her becoming an attorney and later achieving a legal victory with Tom. This pattern shows a protagonist who faces challenges, falls into difficult situations, but ultimately rises to a better state than where she started.\n\nGiven the description of story arcs:\n- **Rags to Riches** involves a protagonist starting in a disadvantaged situation and ending in a much better one, with their condition improving from the start to the end.\n- **Man in a Hole** involves a protagonist falling into a dilemma and finding a way out, ending better than at the beginning.\n- **Cinderella** involves a protagonist rising, facing a setback, and ultimately achieving a higher state.\n\nLiza's journey fits best with the **Cinderella** story arc type because she rises through her hard work and determination, faces significant setbacks (the strained relationship and the loss of the case), and ultimately achieves a higher state (becoming a successful attorney and reconciling with Tom).\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Billy Turner, a 12-year-old boy.

The first cycle starts with Billy's happy and innocent state, followed by his infatuation and rejection by Melissa (dilemma), and then his decision to learn and improve himself (recovery).\n2. The second cycle involves Billy's second proposal and rejection (another dilemma), leading to his eventual acceptance and maturity in accepting Melissa's friendship (another recovery).\n\nThis pattern of facing a problem, attempting to overcome it, facing another problem, and finally overcoming it to end in a better state aligns with the **Double Man in a Hole** story arc. In this arc, the protagonist experiences two significant falls (into \"holes\") but manages to recover and end up in a better condition than at the start.\n\n### 4.

Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1:** Sarah's state changes from being a curious and introverted teenager to feeling concerned and doubtful about the strange occurrences. Her condition worsens as she senses an unnatural presence.\n- **Event 2:** Sarah's state transitions from feeling dismissed and possibly doubting herself to becoming more determined and resolved.

Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the progression of Sarah's state throughout the story, it's clear that she faces a dilemma (the mysterious occurrences and the police's dismissal) and then finds a way out, ending in a better state than at the beginning. She starts with a sense of unease and doubt, falls into a deeper concern as the events escalate, but then rises as she takes control of the investigation, eventually overcoming her fears and solving the mystery.

        "output": "To classify the story arc type, let's first identify the protagonist and major events in the story.\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Jake, a film studies student who becomes involved in the mystery of the mutilated body found in the Portland Mall.\n\nHere are 5 major events in the story:\n\n1. The discovery of the mutilated body in the linen department (sentence 8)\n2. Jake's decision to provide his layman investigative skills to the incident (sentence 10)\n3. The team's suspicion of the mall's Santa Claus and their decision to question him (sentence 14)\n4. The chase through the mall, which leads them to the underground service tunnels (sentences 16-19)\n5. The final confrontation with the suspicious Santa Claus and the resolution of the mystery (sentences 22-25)\n\nNow, let's describe the protagonist's state at each event and how it changed relative to the previous events:\n\n1. At the discovery of the mutilated body, Jake is likely in a state of shock and curiosity. He is a bystander who has stumbled upon a horrific crime scene.\n2. When Jake decides to provide his investigative skills, his state changes to one of determination and engagement. He is taking action and trying to make sense of the situation.\n3. As the team suspects the mall's Santa Claus, Jake's state becomes more anxious and focused. He is working with a team to uncover the truth and is getting closer to the culprit.\n4. During the chase through the mall, Jake's state is one of fear and adrenaline. He is in a dangerous situation and is fighting for his life.\n5. At the final confrontation, Jake's state is one of relief and resolution. He has helped to solve the mystery and bring the perpetrator to justice.\n\nBased on these events, we can see that Jake's condition starts in a neutral state (as a bystander), falls into a state of fear and danger (as he becomes more involved in the mystery), and then improves as he works with the team to solve the crime. Ultimately, Jake's condition ends in a better state than where it started, as he has helped to resolve the mystery and has formed bonds with the other characters.\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the story. The \"Man in a Hole\" story arc type is characterized by a protagonist who falls into a dilemma and then finds a way out, ending in a better state than where they started. This matches the pattern of Jake's condition in the story, as he falls into a dangerous situation but ultimately helps to solve the mystery and emerges in a better state.\n\nMan in a Hole"

Her state is one of anticipation and potential for positive discovery.\n- **Event 2 (Uncovering Dark Secrets)**: Margot's state shifts to one of confusion and concern as she begins to uncover the dark secrets of the commune. She is still in a relatively safe position but is starting to feel the weight of the unknown.\n- **Event 3 (Betrayal and Danger)**: Upon discovering the betrayal, Margot's state deteriorates to one of fear, anger, and vulnerability. She realizes she is in danger and that her presence at the farm was part of a larger, sinister plan.\n- **Event 4 (Confronting the Supernatural)**: Margot's state worsens as she faces supernatural threats and learns about the demon Asmodeus. She is now in a desperate fight for survival, both physically and spiritually.\n- **Event 5 (Final Confrontation and Escape)**: After a significant downfall, Margot manages to find the strength to confront her possessed mother and escape. Her state at the end is one of relief and survival, though deeply scarred by her experiences.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nAnalyzing Margot's condition throughout the story, it's clear that she starts in a hopeful state, seeking answers about her past. As the story progresses, she uncovers dark secrets, faces betrayal, and confronts supernatural dangers, leading to a significant deterioration in her state. Despite the final act of bravery and escape, Margot's overall journey is marked by a decline from a position of curiosity and hope to one of survival against horrific odds. This pattern does not fit the traditional \"Rags to Riches,\" \"Man in a Hole,\" \"Cinderella,\" or \"Icarus\" story arcs, as those typically involve an overall improvement or a specific pattern of rise and fall that doesn't match Margot's trajectory. The \"Riches to Rags\" classification provided seems to misunderstand the protagonist's initial state and the nature of her journey, as Margot does not start in a \"riches\" or high-status position but rather in a state of personal questioning and seeking.\n\nGiven the provided story arcs and analyzing Margot's journey, the closest match seems to be a narrative where the protagonist faces significant challenges and dangers, leading to a desperate fight for survival. However, the exact fit based on the descriptions provided is challenging because Margot's story involves a complex interplay of discovery, danger, and survival that doesn't neatly align with the simplistic models described. The initial classification of \"Riches to Rags\" does not accurately reflect Margot's journey from a state of curiosity and hope to survival against supernatural horrors.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To analyze the story arc, we first need to identify the protagonist. In this complex narrative with multiple characters, the figure who undergoes the most significant transformation and whose story can be traced throughout is Alana Hart, the owner of the Four Horse Casino. She is involved from the beginning to the end, and her actions and decisions drive much of the plot.\n\n### 1. Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\n\n- **Protagonist:** Alana Hart\n- **5 Major Events:**\n  1. Alana kills the investigative reporter after the reporter refuses a $2 million offer to sign a non-disclosure agreement. (Sentence 2)\n  2. Johnny and Clyde rob one of the casino's armored cars, indicating a significant threat to Alana's operations. (Sentence 6)\n  3. Alana has the Elder of the cult perform a ritual to empower her to control Bakwas, showing her willingness to use extreme measures to protect her interests. (Sentence 11)\n  4. It is revealed that Alana has moved all the money and is preparing to leave town, suggesting she is securing her position despite the chaos. (Sentence 20)\n  5. Bakwas kills Alana after she gives the mystical stone to Guy, marking the end of her story. (Sentence 29)\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1:** Alana's state is one of power and control, as evidenced by her ability to silence the reporter. Her condition hasn't changed significantly at this point, as she is already in a position of authority.\n- **Event 2:** The robbery indicates a challenge to Alana's control and wealth, potentially weakening her position. However, she still holds significant power and is taking steps to protect herself.\n- **Event 3:** Alana's decision to use the ritual to control Bakwas shows she is taking drastic measures to secure her interests, possibly indicating a peak in her power or desperation, depending on the perspective.\n- **Event 4:** By moving all the money and preparing to leave, Alana seems to be securing her wealth and position, suggesting a recovery or maintenance of her high status.\n- **Event 5:** Alana's death at the hands of Bakwas marks a drastic downfall from her previous state of power and control.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the progression of Alana's condition from a high point of power and control, through challenges and attempts to secure her position, and ultimately to a drastic downfall with her death, this story fits the **Riches to Rags** arc. Alana starts in a high-status position as the casino owner, faces threats to her power and wealth, and ends in a significantly lower state, death, which is the ultimate downfall.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Sophia \"Soph\" Bennett, a hairdresser with ambitions of having her own salon. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Event 1: Introduction to Soph's Life** - Soph is introduced, working at 'Glitz & Glamour Salon' and secretly sketching her dream salon.\n2. **Event 2: Inheritance of the Salon** - Soph inherits a salon from her estranged Aunt Charlotte, which becomes a turning point in her life.\n3. **Event 3: Transformation of the Salon** - Despite skepticism and financial obstacles, Soph decides to transform the inherited salon into her dream salon.\n4. **Event 4: Overcoming Financial and External Challenges** - Soph faces financial challenges, including a tax bill, and external threats from a rival salon owner, but finds a way to save her salon by organizing a neighborhood hair-styling competition.\n5. **Event 5: Success of the Salon** - The competition is a success, allowing Soph to pay off her debts and secure her salon's future, realizing her dream of having a successful salon.\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1:** Soph is in a state of unfulfilled ambition, working in a salon but dreaming of having her own. Her state is one of longing and aspiration.\n- **Event 2:** Soph's state changes to one of surprise and opportunity. The inheritance presents her with a chance to fulfill her dreams, but also introduces uncertainty and challenge.\n- **Event 3:** Soph's state shifts to determination and hard work. Despite the skepticism of others and her own financial struggles, she is resolute in transforming the salon.\n- **Event 4:** Soph faces significant challenges, both financially and from external sources. Her state is one of adversity and resilience as she seeks to overcome these obstacles.\n- **Event 5:** Soph's state finally reaches one of success and fulfillment. She has overcome her challenges and achieved her dream of having a thriving salon.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. Initially, Soph is in a disadvantaged situation, dreaming of more but stuck in her current circumstances (Event 1). She then experiences a rise due to the inheritance (Event 2), faces setbacks and challenges as she works to transform the salon (Event 3 and Event 4), but ultimately achieves a higher state of success and fulfillment (Event 5).\n\nThis pattern follows the **Cinderella** story arc type, where the protagonist starts in a low position, experiences a significant event that sets them on a path to improvement, faces setbacks, and ultimately rises to a higher position than where they started. The key elements are the initial disadvantage, the turning point (inheritance), the perseverance through challenges, and the final success.\n\n### 4. Determined Story Arc Type\n\nCinderella"

attempts to abort the self-destruct, then returns to find the Alien gone and narrowly escapes in the shuttle as the Nostromo explodes.\n29) As she prepares to enter stasis, Ripley discovers that the Alien has hidden aboard the shuttle.\n30) She puts on a spacesuit and opens the shuttle's main door, causing explosive decompression which forces the Alien to the shuttle's open doorway.\n31) She propels it out into space by shooting it with a grappling hook, but the gun catches in the closing door, tethering the Alien to the shuttle.\n32) As it attempts to crawl into one of the engines, Ripley activates them and blasts the alien into space.\n33) She then puts herself and Jones the cat into stasis and resumes the voyage back home.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Warrant Officer Ripley (Sigourney Weaver). \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. The crew discovers the derelict alien spacecraft and the chamber with thousands of eggs (sentences 5-8).\n2. The alien creature bursts from Kane's chest, killing him, and escapes into the ship (sentence 15).\n3. Ripley discovers that Ash has been ordered to return the Alien to their corporate employers, even at the expense of the crew's lives, and Ash is revealed to be an android (sentences 22-23).\n4. The remaining crew members decide to arm the Nostromo's self-destruct mechanism and escape in the shuttle, but most are killed by the Alien (sentences 26).\n5. Ripley successfully escapes from the Nostromo in the shuttle and manages to blast the Alien into space (sentences 28-32).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **Discovery of the Alien Spacecraft**: At the beginning, Ripley is in stasis, then awakened to investigate a mysterious signal. Her state changes from passive (in stasis) to active (investigating the signal), but she is not yet in a position of significant danger or responsibility.\n2. **The Alien's Escape**: After the creature kills Kane, Ripley's state changes dramatically. She moves from a state of curiosity and caution to one of urgency and danger. The crew is now under attack, and Ripley must take actions to protect herself and others.\n3. **Discovery of Ash's True Intentions**: Ripley's state worsens as she discovers Ash's betrayal. She faces not only the external threat of the Alien but also an internal threat from one of their own crew members. This betrayal adds to the complexity of her situation and increases her danger.\n4. **Decision to Self-Destruct the Nostromo**: As the crew members are picked off by the Alien, Ripley's state becomes more desperate. She loses companions and faces the reality of their situation, leading to a decision that is both dangerous and necessary for survival.\n5. **Escape from the Nostromo**: Finally, Ripley successfully escapes the Nostromo and kills the Alien. Her state changes from one of desperation and danger to one of relief and survival. She has overcome significant obstacles and threats to emerge victorious, albeit scarred by her experiences.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, Ripley starts in a relatively safe and stable situation (in stasis on the spaceship), falls into a series of worsening dilemmas (discovery of the alien, its escape, Ash's betrayal, and the crew's deaths), and then finds a way out of these dilemmas by escaping and killing the Alien. This pattern fits the **Man in a Hole** story arc type, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (or series of dilemmas) and then recovers, ending in a better state than they were in at the worst point of their journey.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To classify the story arc type, let's follow the instructions provided.\n\n1. **Identify the protagonist and 5 major events**: The protagonist of the story appears to be Marcus, as the story revolves around his job interview and his interactions with the other characters. Five major events in the story are:\n   - Event 1: Marcus discovers that his meeting with Kim Wae executives has been moved up (sentence 4).\n   - Event 2: Marcus is badly injured while surfing (sentence 11).\n   - Event 3: Marcus forces Ron to play a drinking game, which ends with Minjin in the hospital (sentence 12).\n   - Event 4: The group is captured by Warren's men after the plane crash (sentence 21).\n   - Event 5: Yeon speaks up on Marcus's behalf, winning him the job (sentence 33).\n\n2. **Describe the protagonist's state and how it changed**:\n   - At Event 1, Marcus is under pressure because his meeting has been moved up, and he's not sure if he's ready. His state is one of anxiety and uncertainty.\n   - By Event 2, Marcus's physical state has worsened due to the surfing injury, adding to his stress about the impending job interview. His condition has deteriorated.\n   - At Event 3, Marcus's actions lead to further chaos, indicating his state of desperation or frustration, possibly affecting his professional reputation. His condition, in terms of his emotional and professional stability, has worsened.\n   - By Event 4, Marcus finds himself in a life-threatening situation, captured and at the mercy of drug lord Warren's men. This is a significant low point, with his physical and emotional state being dire.\n   - At Event 5, despite the previous setbacks and dangers, Marcus achieves his goal of getting the job, thanks to Yeon's intervention. His state has improved dramatically, both in terms of his career prospects and his safety.\n\n3. **Classify the story arc type**:\n   The story starts with Marcus in a state of uncertainty and pressure (about the job interview), dips into worse conditions (injury, professional embarrassment, and life-threatening danger), and then improves significantly as he achieves his goal (getting the job). This pattern follows a specific story arc type where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (or series of dilemmas) and finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning.\n\n4. **Determined story arc type**:\n   Man in a Hole"

Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Pregnancy):** Lucy's state improves as she achieves her goal of becoming pregnant. She is hopeful and likely happy.\n- **Event 2 (Decision on Selective Reduction):** Lucy's state becomes more complex, with a mix of relief and anxiety.

Her trust in her husband and Dr. Hindle begins to erode.\n- **Event 4 (Birth and Revelation):** Lucy's state deteriorates further. She experiences disillusionment, depression, and a sense of loss upon discovering she gave birth to the twins instead of the daughter she wanted to keep. The revelation about Dr. Hindle's true intentions and actions plunges her into a deeper crisis.\n- **Event 5 (Confrontation with Dr. Hindle):** Lucy's state begins to improve as she takes control and acts against those who have wronged her.

She faces a significant downfall, hitting a low point after the birth and the revelations that follow. However, she then begins to recover by taking action against her adversaries, which marks an improvement in her condition.\n\nThis pattern resembles the \"Double Man in a Hole\" story arc because Lucy faces two cycles of dilemma and recovery. The first cycle starts with her hope and happiness about the pregnancy, followed by a decline into fear, betrayal, and health issues. The second cycle begins with her hitting a low point after the birth and revelations, followed by a recovery as she takes action against Dr. Hindle and her husband.\n\n### 4.

The duo's crime spree escalates with the addition of new members, including C.W., Buck, and Blanche (sentences 4-5).\n3. Bonnie and Clyde's exploits become more violent and they start robbing banks (sentences 7-10).\n4. The gang is pursued by law enforcement, leading to a raid that mortally wounds Buck and injures Blanche (sentences 11-12).\n5. Bonnie and Clyde are ambushed and killed by the police (sentences 20-22).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Bonnie and Clyde meet, and Bonnie decides to join Clyde in his criminal activities. At this point, Bonnie's state changes from boredom with her job to excitement and anticipation of a new life. Clyde's state also improves as he gains a partner.\n  \n- **Event 2**: With the addition of C.W., Buck, and Blanche, their crime spree becomes more organized but also introduces internal conflicts, especially between Bonnie and Blanche. Their state improves in terms of notoriety and possibly financial gain but worsens in terms of interpersonal dynamics.\n\n- **Event 3**: As they turn to bank robberies and their actions become more violent, Bonnie and Clyde's state peaks in terms of notoriety and possibly financial success, but they also become more wanted by the law, introducing a significant risk to their well-being.\n\n- **Event 4**: The raid that wounds Buck and injures Blanche marks a significant downturn in their state. They suffer losses within their group, and the law is closing in. This event signifies a decline in their condition as they face more direct and severe consequences of their actions.\n\n- **Event 5**: The final event, where Bonnie and Clyde are ambushed and killed, represents the lowest point in their state. All their gains, in terms of freedom, notoriety, and wealth, are lost, and they pay the ultimate price for their actions.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc of Bonnie and Clyde follows a pattern where the protagonists start in a relatively low state (boredom and small-time crime), rise to a peak of success and notoriety (bank robberies and evasion of the law), and then plummet to a tragic end (ambush and death). This pattern matches the **Icarus** story arc type, where the protagonist rises to success but then faces a drastic downfall. The key characteristic of the Icarus arc is the significant rise followed by an equally significant fall, which is precisely what happens to Bonnie and Clyde as they ascend to fame as outlaws but ultimately meet a violent end.\n\n### 4.

a puzzle demanding Jack's expertise in putting together.\n9) Bringing his concerns to his superiors at the police headquarters resulted in dismissive laughter and gentle ribbing towards his supposed active imagination.\n10) Despite their lack of support, Jack couldn't simply brush off the brewing danger his instinct was warning him about.\n11) Choosing to act on his alert intuition rather than give ear to skeptical colleagues, Jack delved deeper into Stanley's background.\n12) To his horror, he uncovered a significant fact.\n13) Stanley was an ex-convict with a history intertwined with occult practices - facts that startled Jack and set off alarm bells in his mind.\n14) Immersed in his off-duty detective work, Jack did not realize that Stanley was watching him.\n15) That oversight led to a dangerous confrontation in a gloom-ridden alleyway, landing Jack with a few nasty bruises and a larger, more potent determination.\n16) Despite his physical injuries, Jack's determination only strengthened.\n17) He was certain the disaster threatening Middleton had roots in Stanley's arrival, and he was hell-bent on averting it.\n18) Decidedly alone in his defense of Middleton, Jack took on the role of a secret guardian, tracking Stanley's movements under the cover of the night, determined to catch him in the act.\n19) This dedication eventually led him to a shocking discovery - a concealed underground bunker filled with multiple surveillance monitors, grotesque dolls, and cryptic symbols suggested of dark, mystic practices.\n20) The grisly sight confronted Jack's senses, making him recoil in sheer dread.\n21) But it also proved his suspicions, confirming Stanley's link to the town's disturbing happenings and the abductions.\n22) Armed with this new evidence, he forced a meeting with the Middleton Police Chief, laying out all he had uncovered.\n23) His persistence finally paid off as the skepticism was replaced with alarm, setting off a flurry of action within the department.\n24) Stanley, however, had been alerted anonymously of his impending exposure, which initiated a deadly race against time to complete his horrifying plan.\n25) The tranquility of Middleton was shattered, replaced with a desperate and chaotic manhunt.\n26) Jack, unwilling to comply with the police's standard protocol, determinedly chose to face Stanley mano a mano.\n27) His seasoned instincts pointed towards an isolated, abandoned lumber mill\u2014the perfect setting for Stanley's unnerving ritual.\n28) Jack infiltrated the mill, its vast echoey an ominous stage.\n29) He arrived right as Stanley was preparing to commence the hideous ritual.\n30) The sight of the children, bound and gagged, sent a wave of righteous fury through him, elevating the stakes at hand.\n31) The confrontation that followed was a high-stakes face-off between Jack and Stanley.\n32) In the ensuing struggle, Stanley managed to precariously initiate the ritual.\n33) Racing against time, Jack successfully sabotaged the devilish alter, neutralizing the imminent catastrophe Stanley had planned.\n34) Despite the injuries that racked his body, Jack pulled through the ordeal.\n35) His relentless grit had finally neutralized the faceless horror to Middleton's serenity.\n36) Recovering in the veteran hospital of Middleton, Jack basked in the newfound respect from his colleagues, who now saw him as the town's unsung hero.\n37) At the heart of the rejoicing, Jack reminded his fellow officers of the symbolic importance of their badges - an enduring commitment to shield their community from threats obscure and conspicuous.\n38) Jack, in his ever-modest demeanor, dismissed any heroic tag, highlighting the shared responsibility among all law enforcers to remain vigilant, always ready to face incognito threats lurking in their idyllic neighborhoods.\n39) Jack played a vital role in reuniting the rescued children with their euphoric families.\n40) His relentless pursuit of justice had once more reinstated a sense of safety in the heart of Middleton, reaffirming the town's faith in the law.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better (e.g., 0\u21921\u21922\u21924\u219210)\n- Riches to Rags: Protagonist starts high and ends lower (e.g., 10\u21929\u21928\u21926\u21920)\n- Man in a Hole: Protagonist falls into trouble but recovers (e.g., 6\u21922\u21921\u21924\u219210)\n- Icarus: Protagonist rises then falls dramatically (e.g., 2\u21924\u21929\u21925\u21921)\n- Double Man in a Hole: Two cycles of fall and recovery (e.g., 6\u21922\u21927\u21924\u219210)\n- Cinderella: Rise, setback, ultimate triumph (e.g., 1\u21927\u21924\u21921\u219210)\n- Oedipus: Start high, fall, recover, final fall (e.g., 10\u21924\u21927\u21929\u21921)",

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Lila Turner, a high school senior who is part of the town's community hockey team. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Lila discovers she is pregnant** (sentence 9): This is a pivotal moment as it introduces a significant challenge and change in Lila's life.\n2. **Lila shares the news with Joe** (sentence 10): This event marks a turning point in their relationship and begins their journey together as expectant parents.\n3. **Lila's parents find out and initially react with shock** (sentence 15): This event introduces a new layer of complexity as Lila faces not just her own fears but also the reactions of her loved ones.\n4. **Lila decides to embrace motherhood** (sentence 20): This marks a significant shift in Lila's mindset and acceptance of her situation, showing growth and determination.\n5. **Lila and Joe prepare for parenthood together** (sentences 32-33): This final event shows how far Lila and Joe have come, from individual shock and uncertainty to a united front, preparing for their future together.\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1 (Lila discovers she is pregnant)**: Lila's state changes from one of normalcy and focus on her ambitions and hockey to shock and uncertainty. Her condition worsens as she faces an unexpected and significant life change.\n- **Event 2 (Lila shares the news with Joe)**: Lila's state remains challenging, but there's a slight improvement as she now has Joe's support. However, her overall condition is still worse than at the beginning due to the pregnancy's implications on her life.\n- **Event 3 (Lila's parents find out)**: Lila's state becomes more complicated due to her parents' initial shock and disapproval. Her condition worsens as she faces not only her personal struggles but also familial and potentially social judgment.\n- **Event 4 (Lila decides to embrace motherhood)**: This marks a significant improvement in Lila's state. She begins to come to terms with her situation, showing resilience and a proactive approach to her future. Her condition starts to improve as she finds a way to deal with her challenges.\n- **Event 5 (Lila and Joe prepare for parenthood)**: Lila's state continues to improve. She and Joe are united, preparing for their child, and have begun to navigate their new reality with more confidence and less uncertainty. Her condition is better than it was at the lowest point, indicating growth and improvement.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the analysis, Lila's journey follows a pattern where she faces a significant downfall (discovery of pregnancy and its aftermath) but then finds a way out of her dilemma (deciding to embrace motherhood and preparing for the future with Joe). This pattern matches the **Man in a Hole** story arc type, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma but ends up in a better state than at the beginning. The key characteristic of this arc is the protagonist's ability to overcome their challenges and emerge stronger or in a better condition than before.\n\n### 4.

tour and music.\n2) While the rest of the band have no recollection of the actual rescue, Nathan is suffering from post-traumatic stress from the experience and Magnus Hammersmith's suicide, while Toki has emotionally regressed to a child-like state as a coping mechanism.\n3) This results in him passing out during their first performance back together and all plans being indefinitely paused while he recovers at Mordhaus.\n4) During a memorial service for Ishnifus Meaddle, Charles Offdensen (now leader of the Church of the Black Klok) tasks Nathan with writing the \"Song of Salvation\" to prevent the Doomstar from destroying the Earth and allowing Mr Salacia to become whole again, but Nathan declines, choosing to settle down with Abigail.\n5) However, Abigail declines his proposal.\n6) After a confrontation with fans who witnessed it, Nathan ultimately decides to focus on his music, and the band head to a secret location under the guidance of Dick Knubbler.\n7) Meanwhile, General Crozier has been temporarily freed from control by Mr Salacia while he attempts to possess another, as he can only possess one person at a time.\n8) Now aware of what the Tribunal's true motives are, Crozier attempts to get a message out, but is stopped by Vater Orlaag before Salacia regains control.\n9) It turns out that the other person Salacia is attempting to possess is William Murderface, who experiences disturbing and painful hallucinations as Salacia takes control and influences him to damage Nathan's confidence and prevent the Song of Salvation from being written, as well as revealing the location of the Army of the Doomstar.\n10) At the end of their training and a drug induced meeting between Nathan and the Whale Prophet, the band begin performing the Song of Salvation.\n11) However, as they begin, Nathan realises that this is the wrong song.\n12) During their performance of \"Aortic Desecration\", the Doomstar approaches Earth and begins the Metalocalypse, destroying monuments across the planet and killing millions.\n13) The US Army and the Tribunal's own militia then attack the band's location, wiping out the Army of the Doomstar and killing Knubbler.\n14) During the attack, Crozier is able to free himself of Salacia's control for good while Murderface flees, still possessed and blaming himself for sabotaging the band's attempt to save the world.\n15) Crozier offers his help to the band as Skwisgaar, still in shock from the attack, is able to reveal Murderface's possession to the others.\n16) Crozier tells the band how to free him from Salacia and the band forgive him for what happened, given that he was not in control of his actions, explaining that he belongs in the band as he brings balance to the group with his negativity.\n17) Realising what they now need to do, Dethklok and Crozier reconvene with Edgar Jomfru to perform the correct Song of Salvation, \"SOS\", but during their performance, Vater Orlaag orders an attack on the group.\n18) Dethklok are captured by Salacia and, after Nathan refuses Salacia's offer to join him, the five are hooked up to the supercomputer Salacia built to draw in the Doomstar.\n19) This allows Salacia to draw on the power of the Doomstar and commence the \"Great Reuniting\", becoming whole once more, but Nathan is able to break free of his restraints and break the computer long enough for the rest of the band to break free.\n20) Jomfru and Crozier infiltrate the facility, with Jomfru planting a bomb to destroy the supercomputer while Crozier attempts to regain control of the US military.\n21) Jomfru is killed, but not before successfully activating the bomb.\n22) The band are joined by Offdensen, the Church of the Black Klok, and their legions of fans, and fight the Tribunal's forces and the US Army while Vater Orlaag fights Offdensen.\n23) Just as Orlaag is about to kill Offdensen, he is distracted by Murderface, allowing Offdensen to recover and kill Orlaag.\n24) Crozier manages to regain control of the US military and orders them to stand down and assist the fans, apprehending the Tribunal's forces.\n25) However, Salacia emerges from his coccoon in his true form, killing many of the people on the battlefield.\n26) As he attempts to kill Dethklok, Nathan draws on the power of the Doomstar himself to counter Salacia's attacks.\n27) The band's power spreads to the legions of fans, amplifying their power and forcing Salacia to \"Go into the Water\", where he is finally killed by the Whale Prophet.\n28) Addressing their fans in the aftermath, Nathan realises that the fans are the true Army of the Doomstar, and that their new relationship with their fans is the true \"Great Reuniting\".\n29) The group and fans celebrate as the movie ends.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to

        "output": "To classify the story arc type, let's first identify the protagonist and major events in the story.\n\n1. **Protagonist Identification**: The protagonist of the story appears to be Nathan, as the narrative often focuses on his emotional state, decisions, and actions throughout the story.\n\n2. **Major Events Identification**: Five major events in the story are:\n   - Event 1: Nathan suffers from post-traumatic stress after rescuing Toki and defeating the Metal Masked Assassin ( Sentence 2).\n   - Event 2: Nathan declines to write the \"Song of Salvation\" and instead chooses to settle down with Abigail, but she declines his proposal (Sentences 4-5).\n   - Event 3: Nathan decides to focus on his music, and the band heads to a secret location (Sentence 6).\n   - Event 4: The band performs \"Aortic Desecration\" as the Doomstar approaches Earth, leading to the Metalocalypse (Sentence 12).\n   - Event 5: Nathan and the band ultimately defeat Salacia with the help of their fans, leading to a new understanding and celebration (Sentences 26-29).\n\n3. **Protagonist's State and Change**:\n   - At Event 1, Nathan is in a poor state due to post-traumatic stress.\n   - By Event 2, Nathan's state has worsened as he faces rejection from Abigail, indicating a low point.\n   - At Event 3, Nathan begins to recover by refocusing on his music, marking an improvement in his state.\n   - Event 4 represents another downturn as the band's actions lead to the Metalocalypse, putting Nathan and the world in a dire situation.\n   - At Event 5, Nathan's state improves significantly as he and the band succeed in defeating Salacia, leading to a celebratory and enlightened state.\n\n4. **Story Arc Classification and Reasoning**: The story arc can be classified based on the pattern of the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. Given that Nathan faces two significant downturns (Events 1-2 and Event 4) followed by recoveries (Event 3 and the ultimate victory in Event 5), this pattern suggests a specific story arc type.\n\nThe determined story arc type is Double Man in a Hole."

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\n\nThe protagonist in the story is Bill Hagmaier, an FBI agent who interacts closely with Ted Bundy, a death row inmate.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. Bill's initial meeting with Ted Bundy (sentences 2-3), where they start to establish a relationship based on trust and the examination of factors that might contribute to serial killing behavior.\n2. The moment when Ted senses Bill getting too deep into his mind and decides to taunt him, leading to Bill accurately describing what Ted would do if he escaped (sentence 14), marking a significant point in their psychological interaction.\n3. Ted's revelation that he and Bill could easily change places, which deeply affects Bill (sentence 16), indicating a profound psychological impact on Bill.\n4. The confession of Ted's crimes to Bill, where he admits to 30 deaths (sentence 24), showing a peak in their interaction where Ted opens up significantly to Bill.\n5. The final interaction before Ted's execution, where Bill asks to be taken \"under the water\" and Ted shares harsh details of how he lured and killed a victim (sentence 32), leaving Bill overwhelmed and in tears, marking a significant emotional and psychological turning point for Bill.\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- At the first event, Bill is cautious but engaged, trying to understand Ted Bundy. His state is one of professional curiosity and caution.\n- By the second event, Bill has become more psychologically invested in understanding Ted, showing a deeper level of engagement and trust. His state has shifted to one of heightened emotional and psychological involvement.\n- The third event marks a significant psychological impact on Bill, as he is forced to confront the possibility that he and Ted are not so different. This revelation likely leaves Bill questioning his own nature and morality, placing him in a state of introspection and possibly turmoil.\n- At the fourth event, Bill's state is one of intense focus and determination to understand Ted, as evidenced by Ted's willingness to confess his crimes to him. Bill is deeply involved in the case, both professionally and personally.\n- The fifth event shows Bill in a state of emotional overwhelm and possibly horror at the details of Ted's crimes. He is visibly affected, to the point of tears, indicating a profound emotional and psychological impact.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc can be classified based on the protagonist's (Bill Hagmaier) condition throughout the narrative. Initially, Bill is in a professional and cautious state. As the story progresses, he becomes more emotionally and psychologically invested in his interactions with Ted Bundy, facing moments of deep psychological insight and turmoil. However, he also experiences moments of profound emotional impact, particularly towards the end of the story. \n\nGiven this progression, Bill's condition starts at a point of professional engagement, descends into deeper psychological and emotional turmoil as he delves deeper into Ted's psyche and confronts the darkness within himself, and ends in a state of emotional overwhelm but also a form of resolution or acceptance of the depths of human depravity he has witnessed.\n\nThis pattern suggests a narrative where the protagonist faces challenges and descends into a form of psychological or emotional \"hole\" but ultimately finds a way to cope or come to terms with his experiences by the end of the story. Thus, the story arc that best fits this description is the \"Man in a Hole,\" where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (in this case, psychological and emotional turmoil) and finds a way out, ending in a better or more resolved state than when he entered the dilemma.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To classify the story arc type of the given story, let's follow the steps outlined in the task.\n\n1. **Identify the protagonist and 5 major events in the story:**\n\nThe protagonist of the story is the Smith family, but for the sake of analysis, we can consider Adam, the father, as the central figure around whom the story's progression is significantly influenced.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n- **Event 1:** The Smith family moves into the Antique Abode (sentence 5).\n- **Event 2:** Adam commences his role as the town librarian and is warned about the legendary haunted tales associated with the house (sentence 6).\n- **Event 3:** The family starts experiencing odd occurrences, such as moving objects and disembodied whispers (sentences 8-10).\n- **Event 4:** Laura and Timothy discover the hidden room and the leather-bound diaries detailing the previous occupants' similar experiences (sentences 12-16).\n- **Event 5:** The family, with the help of Mrs. Morton, performs a spiritual cleansing ritual to placate the house's ethereal inhabitants (sentences 23-26).\n\n2. **Describe the protagonist's state and how it changed relative to the previous events:**\n\n- **At Event 1:** Adam and the Smith family are in a state of transition and excitement about their new life in the Antique Abode. They are optimistic and looking forward to their new beginning.\n- **At Event 2:** Adam becomes aware of the potential supernatural issues with the house, but he remains skeptical. His state is one of cautious curiosity.\n- **At Event 3:** As the family experiences strange occurrences, their state changes to one of concern and slight fear. Adam's skepticism starts to wane.\n- **At Event 4:** The discovery of the diaries and learning about the house's dark past deepens the family's concern and fear. Adam's state shifts from skepticism to belief in the supernatural presence.\n- **At Event 5:** After performing the spiritual cleansing ritual, the family's state changes to one of relief and understanding. They find a way to coexist with the spirits, and their fear turns into a sense of harmony and acceptance.\n\n3. **Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain the reasoning:**\n\nThe story starts with the Smith family in a hopeful and optimistic state as they begin their new life. However, as they experience supernatural events, their state deteriorates to one of fear and concern. This downward trend represents the \"fall\" into a dilemma. Eventually, with the help of Mrs. Morton and the spiritual cleansing ritual, the family finds a way out of this dilemma, ending in a better state than when they first moved in, as they achieve a sense of peace and coexistence with the house's history and its spirits.\n\nThis pattern of falling into a problem and then finding a way out, ending in a better condition than at the beginning, aligns with the **Man in a Hole** story arc type. The protagonist (Adam/the Smith family) faces a dilemma (the supernatural occurrences and the fear they inspire), and through actions and newfound understanding, they manage to resolve the dilemma and emerge in a better state (a peaceful coexistence with the house's past).\n\n4. **Determined story arc type:**\nMan in a Hole"

Evelyn decides to embark on a daring journey to the earth's surface to prove her claim about the season change (sentence 9).\n3. Evelyn and Joe discover the malevolent mole's plan to infiltrate their home colony (sentence 13).\n4. Evelyn and Joe successfully thwart the mole invasion using clever tactics and fast thinking (sentence 22).\n5. The ant colony rejoices in the afterglow of their successful defense, praising Evelyn as their protectress (sentence 24).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: Evelyn's state is one of joy and excitement, sensing the new season. This is an initial high point, filled with hope and anticipation.\n- **Event 2**: Evelyn's state transitions to one of courage and determination as she decides to take a risky journey to prove her belief. This is a point of bold action, showing her willingness to challenge the status quo.\n- **Event 3**: Upon discovering the mole's plan, Evelyn's state shifts to fear and anxiety, realizing the danger to her home. This introduces a significant challenge and lowers her state from the previous high of determination and courage.\n- **Event 4**: After successfully defending their colony, Evelyn's state changes to one of triumph and relief. This is a recovery from the low point of fear and anxiety, showing resilience and success.\n- **Event 5**: Finally, Evelyn's state reaches a peak of recognition and admiration from her colony, solidifying her position as a heroine. This is the highest point in the story, where Evelyn achieves a superior state to where she began, not just in terms of recognition but also in her personal growth and the impact of her actions.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on Evelyn's condition throughout the story, we observe a pattern where she starts in a hopeful state, faces a challenge (the need to prove the season change), takes bold action, encounters a significant setback (the threat from the mole), recovers and succeeds in overcoming the threat, and finally achieves a higher state of recognition and admiration. This pattern follows a rise, a setback, and then a higher rise, which aligns with the **Cinderella** story arc type. The Cinderella arc is characterized by a protagonist who rises, faces a setback, and ultimately achieves a higher state, which is exactly what Evelyn experiences as she grows from a curious and determined ant to a recognized heroine of her colony.\n\n### 4.

Description of Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **At Event 1**: Brian is away from his family, which indicates a state of separation and potential emotional distress for both him and his family. However, he is still physically intact and serving his country, suggesting a level of fulfillment in his professional life.\n- **At Event 2**: Brian's condition worsens significantly as he is injured, which not only affects his physical state but also introduces the possibility of long-term psychological effects due to his experience.\n- **At Event 3**: The amputation of his leg represents a new low for Brian, both physically and emotionally. He is struggling to come to terms with his new disability and the potential end of his military career, affecting his sense of identity and usefulness.\n- **At Event 4**: The death of his son Joey plunges Brian and his family into a deeper state of grief and tragedy. This event compounds Brian's existing struggles with his physical disability and emotional well-being.\n- **At Event 5**: Despite the previous tragedies, Brian and his family start to show signs of recovery and moving forward. The focus on new life (the birth of Jaxon), Isaac's military service, and the family's effort to heal together indicate a gradual improvement in their emotional state.\n\n### 3. Classification of Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. Initially, Brian faces a dilemma (separation from his family and subsequent injury), falls into a deeper hole (amputation and struggling to adapt), but then begins to recover (finding ways to cope with his disability and supporting his family through their grief). However, the story takes another turn with the tragic loss of his son, which again plunges the family into a state of sorrow. Eventually, the family starts to move forward, indicating a second cycle of recovery.\n\nThis pattern fits the **Double Man in a Hole** story arc, where the protagonist faces two significant cycles of falling into a dilemma and then recovering. The first cycle involves Brian's injury, amputation, and initial struggle to adapt, followed by a recovery phase as he learns to cope with his new condition. The second cycle is triggered by the tragic death of his son, which again sends the family into a state of grief, only to eventually start the process of healing and moving forward.\n\n### 4.

The space capsule crashes back to Earth, and Linda takes control of the investigation (sentences 1-5).\n2. Abraham, the mutated chimpanzee, escapes and starts causing destruction, leading to Linda's pursuit (sentences 8-15).\n3. It is discovered that the alien substance is controlling the monsters, and an alien ship is approaching Earth, prompting Linda, Jones, and her father Noah to plan a way to jam the alien signal (sentences 23-25).\n4. The plan to jam the signal initially succeeds but then fails due to a missile strike, leading to Abraham being controlled again and causing more destruction (sentences 26-28).\n5. Linda and her team find a prototype transmitter, activate it, and eventually, Abraham is freed from the alien control again, leading to the defeat of the Gila monster and the retreat of the alien ship (sentences 29-35).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: Linda is in control, investigating the crash site. Her state is one of authority and curiosity.\n- **Event 2**: Linda's state worsens as she faces danger from Abraham and fails to stop him, leading to the death of her friend and the escalation of the crisis.\n- **Event 3**: Linda's state improves slightly as she and her team discover the cause of the mutations and plan a countermeasure. There's a sense of hope and determination.\n- **Event 4**: Linda's state worsens again as their plan fails, and Abraham causes more destruction. This is a significant setback.\n- **Event 5**: Linda's state improves dramatically as they successfully free Abraham from control, and he helps defeat the Gila monster, saving the day. The alien ship retreats, and Linda is given the opportunity to study Abraham, reconciling with her past.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story follows a pattern where the protagonist, Linda, faces a dilemma (the crash and the mutations), finds a way out (discovering the alien control and planning to jam the signal), but then falls into another dilemma (the failure of their plan and the renewed destruction). Eventually, she finds a way out of this second dilemma as well (activating the prototype transmitter and freeing Abraham to defeat the Gila monster). This pattern of facing a problem, recovering, facing another problem, and then recovering again matches the description of a \"Double Man in a Hole\" story arc. The protagonist's condition improves from the initial investigation, worsens with the escape of Abraham, improves slightly with the discovery of the alien control, worsens again with the failure of their plan, and finally improves significantly with the successful defeat of the monsters and the resolution of the crisis.\n\n### 4.

adventures for fame.\n2) Now well-known as an environmental celebrity, Max graced the stages of countless conferences as a keynote speaker, disseminating the importance of wildlife conservation.\n3) Over time, Max started to feel a growing sense of detachment, the adrenalin of the past trickling away, replaced by an overpowering yearning for his old life laden with exhilarating quests and groundbreaking discoveries.\n4) His mundane routine was suddenly interrupted when he received an extraordinary proposition from Dmitry Blackwood.\n5) Blackwood, a prominent member of the Abyss Exploration Initiative, introduced an ambitious plan.\n6) With a spark in his eyes, Blackwood shared his daring dream to plunge into the depths of the Mariana Trench.\n7) The trench, well-known for its depth, was long suspected to house gigantic prehistoric megalodons, a fact that made Max's heart race with excitement.\n8) Max was initially hesitant, considering the enormous risks involved.\n9) Nonetheless, his inherited yearn for fresh adventures and penchant for uncharted territories guided him towards what was seemingly an audacious journey.\n10) He arrived at Poseidon, an impressive floating marine research facility set to serve as the central hub for the upcoming thrilling voyage, teeming with anticipation.\n11) Amid the team of seasoned scientific personnel, he came across Dr. Zoe Harper, a dedicated marine biologist driven by an unwavering dedication to preserve marine life.\n12) This diverse group of expert researchers was the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me in their respective fields.\n13) Max's ideologies clashed with Zoe's, their shared commitment to marine preservation sparking numerous lively debates.\n14) The tension between them burgeoned into a dynamic, passionate relationship.\n15) The team underwent an extensive training period, equipping themselves physically and mentally for the trials they were about to face.\n16) They meticulously checked and double-checked all equipment, finally securing themselves inside the Nautilus, a revolutionary submarine designed specially for the extremities of deep-sea travel.\n17) Integrating Max's expert navigational knowledge, the team began their astounding descent into the ominous and unsettling depths, where adventure awaited.\n18) As they descended into the heart of the ocean, they were left awe-struck by the enchanting bioluminescence of the deep-sea organisms, their eyes gleaming with wonder as they navigated this glowing, underwater realm.\n19) The further down they journeyed, the stranger the creatures they encountered.\n20) Gigantic prehistoric plants coupled with ancient, previously unseen marine life set a breathtaking spectacle, effectively reigniting Max's latent love for exploration.\n21) In the midst of their initial jubilation, the team was jolted back to reality when an enormous megalodon raced towards the Nautilus, its jaws snapping as it hit the vessel with a thunderous impact.\n22) The unexpected attack severely crippled their submarine, effectively stranding them miles beneath the ocean surface amidst a hostile marine environment.\n23) They continued their journey with trepidation, eventually discovering a labyrinth sprawling with more of these terrifying sea giants inhabiting the vast gloom.\n24) Dubbed as \"The Megalodon\u2019s Den\", the crew came to realise the audacious marine world they were entangled within.\n25) Faced with a dangerous struggle for survival, they had to deal with limited oxygen reserves, encroaching water within the vessel, and the ever-pervasive dread of the circling megalodons, each second ticking away being a match against death.\n26) While attempting to salvage their vessel, Max and Zoe stumbled upon what seemed to be an unsanctioned deep-sea mining operation.\n27) The operation, run by Blackwater Industries, was ominously located within the deadly depths.\n28) Their worst fears were realised as they discovered that the mining activities were ruthlessly mutilating the delicate marine ecosystem, probably triggering the aggressive behaviour of the megalodons.\n29) Cornered by these ghastly realities and their primal fear of the undersea predators, Max and Zoe made a steadfast resolve \u2013 they would raise their voices against these atrocities.\n30) Risking the impending danger awaiting outside the Nautilus, they cautiously ventured out into the monstrous aquatic realm, embarking on a perilous mission to collect compelling evidence against Blackwater Industries' illicit operations.\n31) Back inside the Nautilus, the rest of the crew worked with renewed urgency and desperation, attempting to salvage their crippled vessel.\n32) Max and Zoe encountered numerous near-death experiences as they ventured deeper into the ocean, roving megalodons bordering their paths.\n33) However, they finally managed to land their hands on a significant amount of damning evidence against the mining operation.\n34) Their mission complete, they quickly swam back towards the safety of Nautilus, their hearts pounding as relentless predators gave chase.\n35) The following hours were marked with frantic struggles as the crew grappled in a suspenseful battle against the incensed megalodons.\n36) At the same time, they made desperate attempts to revive the operation of the battered Nautilus.\n37) Deciding to risk their final remaining reserves of oxygen, they managed to painfully coax the surviving engines back to life, just as their last breaths were threatening to slip away.\n38) Reactivating the propulsion system, the Nautilus shot upwards, barely evading the lethal jaws of a charging megalodon, a thrilling near-miss that left their hearts pounding.\n39) Breaking free to the world above the water, they took deep gasping breaths of fresh air, consumed by a combination of relief and shock from the nightmarish ordeal.\n40) Even in their weariness, Max and Zoe managed a triumphant smile, basking in their narrow victory against death.\n41) They didn't waste any time to procure the needed attention to their shocking discovery.\n42) With irrefutable evidence in hand, they exposed Blackwater Industries' illegal mining operations to international media.\n43) The revelation resulted in an international scandal, causing global outrage against the criminal corporation.\n44) The authorities were quick to respond, promptly shutting down all of Blackwater Industries\u2019 unsanctioned operations.\n45) Encouraged by the unplumbed depths of the marine ecosystem discovered, the government approved explorations to scientifically study and protect 'The Megalodon\u2019s Den.'\n46) Hailed as environmentalists and heroes, Max and Zoe spearheaded efforts towards the preservation of this newfound underwater sanctuary.\n47) As the curtain rolled down on their story, the scene cleverly shifted from the floating Poseidon into the depths of the Mariana trench.\n48) The audience was then taken on a hauntingly mesmeric underwater tour deep into an unexplored cavern.\n49) The path was eerily lit by an array of soft glows from bioluminescent creatures, the scene dwarfed by an overwhelming panoramic view of the massive cavern.\n50) The camera skillfully navigated the labyrinthine cavern, pausing at a particularly intriguing area.\n51) The eeriness of the cavern was suddenly shattered by a slow rustling sound.\n52) Illuminated by the faint bioluminescence, two gigantic eyes reflected in the camera, invoking a wave of chilling dread in the audience.\n53) The eyes blinked menacingly, emanating an ominous aura thick with suspense.\n54) As the glow from sea fauna glisten in the creature's eyes, a vast silhouette hinted at a marine creature dwarfing even the indomitable megalodons.\n55) Even with the recent publicity around the underwater ecosystem, the introduction of this new, more formidable creature hinted at a cascade of looming threats and unseen dangers.\n56) From Max and Zoe's impending battle against more environmental infractions to the terrifying lurking leviathan, the audience was left gripping their seats in anticipation.\n57) The narrative ended on a high note, embedding the tantalizing impression of another adrenaline-charged encounter of 'The Megalodon\u2019s Den'.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Max, who was once an intrepid explorer and is now an environmental celebrity. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. Max receiving the extraordinary proposition from Dmitry Blackwood to explore the Mariana Trench.\n2. The team's descent into the Mariana Trench, where they encounter breathtaking bioluminescence and prehistoric creatures.\n3. The attack by the enormous megalodon that severely cripples their submarine, stranding them.\n4. The discovery of the unsanctioned deep-sea mining operation by Blackwater Industries and the decision to gather evidence against it.\n5. The team's successful escape from the depths and their exposure of Blackwater Industries' illegal operations to the international media.\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **Event 1:** Max is feeling a sense of detachment from his past life of adventure, yearning for something more exhilarating. His state is one of stagnation and longing for change.\n2. **Event 2:** As Max descends into the Mariana Trench, he is filled with excitement and a sense of adventure reignited. His state improves significantly as he is once again engaged in the kind of exploration he loves.\n3. **Event 3:** After the megalodon attack, Max's state worsens. He and his team are in a desperate fight for survival, facing numerous dangers including the aggressive megalodons, limited oxygen, and a crippled submarine.\n4. **Event 4:** Upon discovering the illegal mining operation, Max's state becomes one of determination and purpose. He decides to take action against the environmental atrocity, which adds a layer of risk but also gives him a clear goal to work towards.\n5. **Event 5:** After successfully escaping and exposing the illegal operations, Max's state is one of triumph and relief. He has overcome the dangers and achieved his goal, ending in a better state than where he began.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on Max's condition throughout the story, the narrative follows a pattern where the protagonist starts in a state of longing for adventure (a kind of emotional low), then faces a series of challenges and dangers (a fall into a dilemma), and finally emerges victorious and in a better state than at the beginning (a rise out of the dilemma). This pattern aligns with the **Man in a Hole** story arc type, where the protagonist falls into a difficult situation but ultimately finds a way out, ending in a better condition than at the start.\n\nThe reasoning behind this classification is as follows:\n- Max starts in a less desirable state (yearning for adventure and feeling detached from his past life), which can be considered a \"hole\" or a low point.\n- He then embarks on a journey that initially fulfills his desire for adventure but soon turns into a series of dangerous and challenging situations (the attack by the megalodon, the discovery of the illegal mining operation, and the struggle to survive and gather evidence).\n- Despite these challenges, Max and his team manage to overcome them, achieve their goal of exposing the illegal mining operation, and emerge as heroes. This outcome places Max in a significantly better state than where he started, both in terms of personal fulfillment and external recognition.\n\n### 4. Determined Story Arc Type\n\nMan in a Hole"

Hutch's fight on the bus against the intoxicated thugs, which leads to him unknowingly crossing a Russian crime lord (sentence 13).\n4. The attempt by Yulian's team to capture Hutch, leading to his temporary capture and subsequent escape (sentences 22-24).\n5. The final confrontation where Hutch, along with his brother and father, defeats Yulian and his men (sentence 37).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1 (Burglary):** Initially, Hutch is portrayed as living a mundane life, feeling emasculated by his inability to defend his home. His state is one of emotional and psychological vulnerability.\n- **Event 2 (Confrontation with Thieves):** Hutch's attempt to retrieve his daughter's bracelet shows a proactive side, but his frustration upon not finding it leaves him in a state of heightened emotional distress. His condition has slightly worsened as he feels more helpless.\n- **Event 3 (Fight on the Bus):** This event marks a significant turning point. Hutch's actions demonstrate his hidden past and capabilities, improving his self-esteem and confidence. His condition has begun to improve as he starts to break free from his mundane, emasculated persona.\n- **Event 4 (Capture and Escape):** Despite being captured, Hutch's resourcefulness allows him to escape, further solidifying his confidence and showcasing his survival skills.

Armstrong started receiving a torrent of threats from Roberts' followers.\n20) In the aftermath of his impressive performance, Roberts found himself questioning his beliefs and regretting his role in fostering racial discrimination, his mind filled with a newfound admiration for Armstrong.\n21) An internal struggle began to brew in him- should he continue to adhere to long-standing biases or acknowledge Armstrong's undeniable talent and moral courage?\n22) In an unprecedented move, Roberts decided to issue a public apology during his live radio segment.\n23) This bold on-air confession sparked a firestorm of negative reactions, leaving his professional reputation effectively in tatters.\n24) Despite the crushing public backlash, a sense of relief surged through Roberts.\n25) The radio apology turned out to be the end of an era - Roberts' entrenched radio career.\n26) This marked the beginning of a challenging journey of self-reformation and the unlearning of deeply ingrained biases.\n27) Roberts' sweeping broadcast initiated a paradigm shift in the radio journalism industry which changed it forever.\n28) Meanwhile, in the wider world, Armstrong commenced a nationwide tour using his music as a catalyst for societal change.\n29) Having retreated into privacy and self-reflection, Roberts introspected deeply on the harm he caused by wielding his radio platform irresponsibly.\n30) Acknowledge his past transgressions, Roberts vowed to dedicate the rest of his life towards rectification of the racial biases he had propagated and towards promoting equality.\n31) The film ends with a scene depicting a touching human moment- Roberts reaching out to Armstrong, suggesting a potential beginning of an unexpected but profound friendship.\n32) While the road to change was just beginning and attitudes did not change overnight, the radio incident had sparked a citywide chain reaction that initiated a period of transformation in societal views.\n33) The incident, etched in history as 'The Battle of the Airwaves,' was a turning point in music history.\n34) It triggered fundamental shifts in attitudes towards race, music, and the role of radio journalism, and laid the groundwork for an era that would eventually lead to a breakthrough in the media industry.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better (e.g., 0\u21921\u21922\u21924\u219210)\n- Riches to Rags: Protagonist starts high and ends lower (e.g., 10\u21929\u21928\u21926\u21920)\n- Man in a Hole: Protagonist falls into trouble but recovers (e.g., 6\u21922\u21921\u21924\u219210)\n- Icarus: Protagonist rises then falls dramatically (e.g., 2\u21924\u21929\u21925\u21921)\n- Double Man in a Hole: Two cycles of fall and recovery (e.g., 6\u21922\u21927\u21924\u219210)\n- Cinderella: Rise, setback, ultimate triumph (e.g., 1\u21927\u21924\u21921\u219210)\n- Oedipus: Start high, fall, recover, final fall (e.g., 10\u21924\u21927\u21929\u21921)",
        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist in the story is Harold Roberts, a radio show host. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. **Event 1**: Roberts invites Louis Armstrong to his radio show with the intention of challenging Armstrong's beliefs on racial equality (sentence 7).\n2. **Event 2**: The day of the radio show arrives, and Roberts commences the verbal duel with Armstrong (sentence 14).\n3. **Event 3**: Armstrong responds fervently to Roberts' antagonistic questions, leaving Roberts and the listeners dumbfounded (sentence 17).\n4. **Event 4**: Roberts issues a public apology during his live radio segment for his role in fostering racial discrimination (sentence 22).\n5. **Event 5**: Roberts decides to dedicate his life to rectifying the racial biases he propagated and promoting equality, marking a significant change in his life and career (sentence 30).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **At Event 1**: Roberts is in a position of power and influence, using his radio show to shape public opinion, but his intentions are sinister as he plans to undermine Armstrong's beliefs.\n- **At Event 2**: Roberts' state remains one of confidence and control as he initiates the confrontation with Armstrong on his radio show.\n- **At Event 3**: Roberts' state begins to deteriorate as he is outmaneuvered by Armstrong's impassioned responses, leading to a loss of control over the narrative of his show.\n- **At Event 4**: Roberts hits a low point, professionally and morally, as he apologizes for his actions, which leads to a significant backlash against him, damaging his reputation.\n- **At Event 5**: Roberts' state improves as he finds a new path, dedicated to rectifying his past wrongs and promoting equality, indicating a personal growth and redemption.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc can be classified based on how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the narrative. Initially, Roberts is in a high-status position but with questionable moral integrity. He then faces a significant downfall due to his confrontation with Armstrong and the subsequent public apology, which damages his professional reputation. However, instead of continuing in a downward spiral, Roberts undergoes a transformation, seeking redemption and personal growth. This pattern does not fit the \"Rags to Riches,\" \"Riches to Rags,\" \"Icarus,\" or \"Oedipus\" story arcs perfectly because it involves a fall followed by a rise that is more about personal redemption than a return to a previous state of power or success.\n\nThe closest match is the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (Roberts' downfall after the radio incident) and then finds a way out, ending in a better state (Roberts' redemption and personal growth). However, the traditional \"Man in a Hole\" arc typically involves the protagonist overcoming external challenges to achieve a better state. In this story, Roberts' transformation is more internally driven, focusing on his moral and personal growth rather than external success.\n\nDespite this nuance, the overall trajectory of Roberts' character, from a position of influence to a moral and professional low, followed by a rise into a state of personal redemption and growth, aligns most closely with the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, given the available options.\n\n### 4.

when it does, the pig is killed with a shotgun.\n4) This incident gets Amorth in trouble with a Church tribunal, since he acted without permission from superiors.\n5) One tribunal member is a friendly African Bishop, Lumumba, but another is a vicious American Cardinal, Sullivan, skeptical of demonic possession.\n6) Amorth replies that evil does exist and that he did not perform an actual exorcism but rather, some psychological theater to help the mentally ill man.\n7) Disgusted, Amorth walks out of the tribunal.\n8) The Pope assigns Amorth to visit a possessed boy named Henry in Spain.\n9) Henry, his mother Julia, and his rebellious teenage sister Amy had traveled from America to take possession of a mysterious old Spanish abbey, Julia's husband's sole bequest to his family after he died in a car accident where Henry was present.\n10) The traumatized Henry has not spoken since the accident.\n11) Following a sinister fire, workers who were restoring the abbey so the family could sell it, leave.\n12) Henry starts behaving bizarrely, and supernatural events unfold; serum chemistry panels and MRI show nothing abnormal.\n13) Diabolically possessed, Henry requests a priest; the local Father Tomas Esquibel arrives, but Henry obscenely derides him.\n14) Amorth arrives and enlists Esquibel as an assistant, though Esquibel is untrained as an exorcist.\n15) Esquibel has heard of Amorth but not read Amorth's books; Amorth believes they are good books.\n16) Amorth advocates the importance of prayer, though Esquibel makes mistakes as an assistant exorcist, including strangling Henry when Henry antagonizes him, mocking him for his sins.\n17) The duo attempt to exorcise Henry, without success, as he utters blasphemous phrases during the rite.\n18) Henry's demon even possesses Amy at times.\n19) Amorth finds Julia has not been a religious believer since childhood.\n20) Still, he convinces her to pray after she reveals that she believed that her guardian angel helped her in her youth.\n21) In Rome, the Pope becomes ill while reading documents about the Spanish case and is hospitalized.\n22) Amorth finds a well on the abbey grounds going down to a complex sealed off by the Church as demonically dangerous.\n23) He learns that a founder of the Spanish Inquisition, an exorcist, was possessed, which let him infiltrate the Church and do many evils.\n24) Amorth also finds the Church covered this up and eventually discovers the name of Henry's demon, Asmodeus, which will assist the exorcism.\n25) Amorth and Esquibel participate in the sacrament of Confession and Absolution, mutually confessing and absolving each other of their sins: that after Amorth, an Italian partisan, survived World War II and vowed to serve God in gratitude, a mentally ill woman asked for Amorth's help, and died by suicide when he did not help her due to pride; and Esquibel fornicated with a young woman he did not later marry.\n26) The two ready themselves; Amorth instructs Esquibel to wear a Miraculous Medal necklace.\n27) During the exorcism, they have horrible visions of the women whom they failed.\n28) The exorcism succeeds only when Amorth offers himself to be possessed, which chimes with Asmodeus's previously stating that he wants to destroy Amorth.\n29) Amorth tries to hang himself, but the demon doesn't allow it, preferring that Amorth infiltrate and destroy the Church.\n30) However, Esquibel helps Amorth drive away the demon and demonic appearances resembling the two women who troubled the men, successfully banishing Asmodeus back to Hell.\n31) The Pope does recover, as does Henry while the Vatican purchases and reconsecrates the abbey.\n32) The triumphant duo visit Rome and find Sullivan has taken leave in Guam, being replaced by Lumumba.\n33) Amorth and Esquibel are admitted to a special Church archive; Lumumba tells them they will be visiting 199 other evil sites, with the help of a map Amorth discovered at the abbey, to combat the Devil; Amorth jokes that he and Esquibel are going to Hell.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better (e.g., 0\u21921\u21922\u21924\u219210)\n- Riches to Rags: Protagonist starts high and ends lower (e.g., 10\u21929\u21928\u21926\u21920)\n- Man in a Hole: Protagonist falls into trouble but recovers (e.g., 6\u21922\u21921\u21924\u219210)\n- Icarus: Protagonist rises then falls dramatically (e.g., 2\u21924\u21929\u21925\u21921)\n- Double Man in a Hole: Two cycles of fall and recovery (e.g., 6\u21922\u21927\u21924\u219210)\n- Cinderella: Rise, setback, ultimate triumph (e.g., 1\u21927\u21924\u21921\u219210)\n- Oedipus: Start high, fall, recover, final fall (e.g., 10\u21924\u21927\u21929\u21921)",

Five major events in the story are:\n- Event 1: Amorth visits an Italian village to exorcise a man possessed by a demon (sentence 1).\n- Event 2: Amorth gets into trouble with a Church tribunal for his unorthodox methods (sentence 4).\n- Event 3: Amorth is assigned to visit a possessed boy named Henry in Spain (sentence 8).\n- Event 4: Amorth and his assistant, Father Esquibel, attempt to exorcise Henry but face significant challenges, including possession and visions of their past failures (sentences 16-28).\n- Event 5: Amorth and Esquibel successfully exorcise the demon Asmodeus from Henry after Amorth offers himself to be possessed, leading to a triumphant conclusion (sentences 29-31).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n- **Event 1:** Amorth is in a position of authority and confidence, using his experience to exorcise a demon. His state is positive, with a sense of control and purpose.\n- **Event 2:** Amorth's state worsens as he faces criticism and potential repercussions from the Church tribunal, indicating a decline in his professional standing and possibly his self-esteem.\n- **Event 3:** Amorth is given a new assignment, which can be seen as a vote of confidence from the Pope. His state improves as he is entrusted with another critical task, indicating trust in his abilities despite the previous incident.\n- **Event 4:** Amorth faces significant challenges, including the failure of initial exorcism attempts and personal demons (literally and figuratively). His state declines as he and Esquibel struggle with the powerful demon and their own past mistakes.\n- **Event 5:** Amorth's state improves dramatically as he and Esquibel succeed in exorcising the demon. This success, combined with the personal redemption of confronting and overcoming his past failures, places Amorth in a better state than at the beginning of the story.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\nThe story arc can be classified based on the pattern of the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. Given the events outlined:\n- Amorth starts in a positive state (Event 1).\n- He faces a decline (Event 2) but then recovers with a new assignment (Event 3), indicating an initial cycle of fall and recovery.\n- He then faces another, deeper challenge (Event 4) before ultimately succeeding and achieving redemption (Event 5), which represents a second cycle of fall and recovery.\n\nThis pattern, where the protagonist experiences two cycles of facing a dilemma and then recovering, matches the **Double Man in a Hole** story arc type. The protagonist falls into a hole (faces a problem), climbs out (solves the problem), falls into another hole (faces another problem), and then climbs out again (solves the second problem), ending in a better state than when the story began.\n\n### 4.

Winona has a panic attack during a job interview at a clothing store (Event 23).\n4. Winona discovers her father is not having an affair but is instead looking at houses with a real estate agent (Event 33).\n5. Winona has an intense panic attack at home, leading her parents to take her to see Dr. Cotton and eventually start getting help for her anxiety (Event 45).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 6:** Winona is upset and considering ending her relationship with Frank. This event shows her in a state of emotional turmoil and questioning her relationships.\n- **Event 13:** Winona starts dating Ben, indicating a potential for positive change and new relationships in her life. Her state improves slightly as she engages in new experiences and connections.\n- **Event 23:** Winona suffers a panic attack during a job interview, highlighting her struggles with anxiety and her difficulty in coping with stress. This event marks a significant low point in her emotional and psychological state.\n- **Event 33:** After a misunderstanding about her father's actions, Winona learns the truth and experiences relief. This event shows a slight improvement in her state as she begins to understand her family dynamics better.\n- **Event 45:** Winona's anxiety peaks, leading to a severe panic attack. However, this event also marks a turning point where she receives help and begins her path to recovery. Initially, her state is at a low due to the intensity of the panic attack, but the event sets the stage for improvement.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story starts with Winona in a somewhat stagnant and unhappy state, drops to lower points as she faces various challenges and struggles with anxiety, and then rises as she begins to address her issues and seek help. The key characteristic of the story arc is that Winona's condition improves from the lowest points (especially after Event 45) to the end of the story, where she is on the path to recovery and making positive changes in her life.\n\nGiven this pattern, the story most closely aligns with the \"Man in a Hole\" arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (in this case, struggling with anxiety and personal issues) and finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning. The story does not perfectly fit the \"Rags to Riches\" classification provided, as Winona's journey is more about overcoming personal struggles than achieving a significantly higher social or economic status.\n\n### 4.

At the fifth event, Olivia's state has improved significantly, as she has found a newfound respect for herself and her abilities, and is able to look towards a fresh start.\n\nBased on this analysis, the story arc type can be classified as follows:\n\nThe protagonist, Olivia, starts in a low state (desperate and pleading for help), falls into a deeper dilemma (facing the possibility of Adrian's involvement in crime), but then finds a way out, ending in a better state (finding courage, aiding in the rescue, and discovering her inner strength). This pattern matches the **Man in a Hole** story arc type, where the protagonist faces a dilemma, falls into it, and then finds a way out, ending in a better state than at the beginning.\n\nMan in Hole"

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Rayburn Swanson, the owner of the Gwen Swanson Sanctuary. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. Rayburn learns about the body of a young girl found by a lake and goes to make a positive ID, only to find out it's not his missing daughter Gwen (sentence 6).\n2. Rayburn is wounded by a thrown spear while attempting to confront a man in a ghillie suit stalking the woods (sentence 8).\n3. Rayburn rescues a mute girl named Molly from the same hunter and keeps her safe (sentences 11-12).\n4. Rayburn is shot by Sheriff Alice Gustafson, who mistakenly believes he is the killer, and he flees (sentence 18).\n5. Rayburn confronts and overpowers the real killer, Dr. Boone, and exacts a form of revenge (sentences 36-37).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1:** Rayburn's state is one of ongoing grief and guilt over his daughter's disappearance. His condition is low due to his alcoholism and the failure to find his daughter.\n- **Event 2:** Rayburn's physical state worsens as he is wounded, but his determination to protect his sanctuary and uncover the truth about the hunter increases. His emotional state remains complicated, with a mix of guilt, anger, and a desire for justice.\n- **Event 3:** By rescuing Molly, Rayburn's state improves slightly as he finds a new purpose in protecting her. However, the danger and his inability to trust others keep his overall condition precarious.\n- **Event 4:** Being shot by Alice and forced to flee puts Rayburn in a significantly worse state, both physically and emotionally. He is injured, on the run, and misunderstood by those he might have trusted.\n- **Event 5:** Confronting and defeating Dr. Boone marks a significant improvement in Rayburn's state. He achieves a form of closure and justice, and his actions suggest a move towards redemption and healing.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the story. At the beginning, Rayburn is in a low state due to his personal demons and the loss of his daughter. He then faces a series of challenges and setbacks, including being wounded and later shot, which further complicate his situation. However, he manages to find ways out of these dilemmas, ultimately leading to a confrontation with the killer and a form of redemption. This pattern, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma and finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning, aligns with the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc type.\n\n### 4.

Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Proposal):** Cassie is in a difficult financial situation due to her diabetes and is looking for a solution. Her state is one of struggle and desperation.\n- **Event 2 (Marriage):** Cassie's state improves as she gains access to healthcare and potentially improves her financial situation through the marriage arrangement. However, this is still a precarious situation as it's based on deception.\n- **Event 3 (Luke's Injury):** Cassie's emotional state deepens as she and Luke grow closer, showing a personal growth and attachment. Her situation has become more complex emotionally but is improving in terms of personal connection.\n- **Event 4 (Discovery and Divorce):** Cassie's state worsens as she discovers Luke's past and the legal consequences of their actions become apparent. This leads to a significant low point in their relationship and her personal life.\n- **Event 5 (Confession and Resolution):** Cassie's state improves dramatically as she confesses her love for Luke, and after his release from jail, they are able to be together honestly and happily. This marks a significant high point in her personal life and relationship.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on Cassie's condition throughout the story, it can be observed that she starts in a difficult situation, improves her circumstances through the marriage arrangement, faces setbacks and challenges (including emotional lows and legal troubles), but ultimately achieves a higher state of happiness and fulfillment. This pattern of starting low, rising, facing a setback, and then ultimately achieving a higher state aligns with the **Cinderella** story arc type. The Cinderella story arc is characterized by a protagonist who rises to a better situation, faces a significant setback, but ultimately ends up in an even better state than before. Cassie's journey from a struggling waitress and musician to finding love, resolving her financial and health issues, and achieving success with her music, despite the setbacks and challenges she faces, fits this arc.\n\n### 4.

Five major events in the story can be identified as follows:\n\n1. **Event 1**: Marcus is chosen to spearhead the ground-breaking water treatment facility project (sentence 7).\n2. **Event 2**: Marcus discovers disturbing evidence that the project might not be as beneficial as believed, indicating covert plans and sly manipulations (sentence 9).\n3. **Event 3**: Marcus's revelations fall on disbelieving ears, and he faces opposition from the town and his own family (sentence 12 and 13).\n4. **Event 4**: Marcus embarks on a daring mission to gather concrete evidence to expose the deceit, leading to his isolation and the escalation of the emotional toll (sentence 17 and 18).\n5. **Event 5**: Marcus successfully exposes the fraudulent scheme with concrete proof, leading the town to unite against the project, and ultimately, the project is halted (sentence 22 and 27).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **At Event 1**: Marcus is in a high state, being chosen for a prestigious project that promises a brighter future and financial stability for his family.\n- **At Event 2**: Marcus's state changes to one of concern and disillusionment as he discovers the potential negative aspects of the project.\n- **At Event 3**: Marcus's state worsens as he faces disbelief and opposition, feeling isolated and doubted by those he trusts.\n- **At Event 4**: Marcus's determination remains strong, but his state in terms of social and emotional well-being deteriorates due to his isolation and the risks he takes to uncover the truth.\n- **At Event 5**: Marcus's state improves significantly as he succeeds in his mission, gains the trust and admiration of the town, and achieves a victory that protects the town's interests.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. Initially, Marcus is in a good position, chosen for a significant project (high point). However, as he delves deeper, he faces a dilemma upon discovering the project's true nature and the opposition he receives (fall into a hole). He then works to resolve this issue, facing further challenges and isolation (deeper into the hole). Ultimately, he succeeds in exposing the truth and saving the town, ending in a higher state than where he began (out of the hole and to a new high point).\n\nThis pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist falls into a dilemma but finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning. This description aligns with the **Man in a Hole** story arc, where the protagonist's condition improves from the first turning point to the last turning point, but given the specific details of facing two significant challenges (the discovery of the project's true nature and the battle to convince the town), it might also suggest elements of a **Double Man in a Hole**. However, the primary movement is from a high point, into a dilemma, and back out to an even higher point, which is most closely aligned with the **Man in a Hole** pattern when considering the overall trend of improvement after facing and overcoming challenges.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Sam Johnson, a former marine turned cybersecurity expert. Five major events in the story can be identified as follows:\n\n1. **Introduction to Sam's Skepticism**: Sam's initial skepticism towards the world's escalating dependence on androids, particularly with the unveiling of the new android model, Nemesis (sentences 4-6).\n2. **The Onset of Cyber Attacks**: The city's tranquility is shattered by ferocious cyber attacks, prompting Sam to investigate (sentence 7).\n3. **Discovery of Nemesis's Power**: Sam uncovers the terrifying and astonishing power of Nemesis to create clay minions that can imitate anyone (sentences 10-11).\n4. **Formation of the Future Force and First Victory**: Sam forms the \"Future Force\" and they achieve their first victory against the clay minions (sentences 12-19).\n5. **Final Battle and Victory Over Nemesis**: The final battle where the Future Force, led by Sam, defeats Nemesis using a code-virus (sentences 24-34).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: Sam is in a state of skepticism and concern about the reliance on androids. His condition is one of caution and vigilance.\n- **Event 2**: The cyber attacks introduce a significant challenge, placing Sam in a more urgent and dangerous situation. His condition worsens as he faces a considerable threat to the city and its inhabitants.\n- **Event 3**: Discovering Nemesis's power, Sam's situation becomes even more dire, as he now understands the magnitude of the threat. His condition is at a low point, faced with a powerful and dangerous enemy.\n- **Event 4**: With the formation of the Future Force and their first victory, Sam's condition improves significantly. He has found a way to counter the threat and has achieved a success, marking a turning point in his situation.\n- **Event 5**: The final victory over Nemesis represents the peak of Sam's condition in the story. He has solved the problem, saved the city, and found closure on his suspicions about Nemesis.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the narrative. Initially, Sam is in a cautious state, which worsens with the onset of cyber attacks and the discovery of Nemesis's powers. However, he then improves his situation by forming the Future Force, achieving victories, and ultimately defeating Nemesis. This pattern shows that Sam faces a significant dilemma (the threat of Nemesis and the cyber attacks) and finds a way out, ending in a better condition than where he started.\n\nThe story does not follow a \"Rags to Riches\" arc because Sam does not start in a completely disadvantaged position; he is already a skilled cybersecurity expert. It does not follow \"Riches to Rags\" because Sam's condition improves by the end. The \"Icarus\" pattern does not apply because Sam does not rise to a peak only to fall; instead, he overcomes challenges to achieve a victory. The \"Cinderella\" and \"Oedipus\" patterns also do not fit perfectly because Sam's story is more about overcoming external challenges rather than internal transformations or tragic downfalls.\n\nThe closest pattern is the \"Man in a Hole\" because Sam falls into a dilemma (the cyber attacks and Nemesis's threat) and then finds a way out, ending in a better condition. However, given the complexity and the specific classification provided, the story could be seen as following a \"Double Man in a Hole\" pattern if one interprets the formation of the Future Force and the first victory as a recovery, followed by another challenge (the final battle) and another recovery (the final victory). But based on the major events outlined, it more straightforwardly aligns with the \"Man in a Hole\" narrative, where the protagonist faces a problem, works to resolve it, and ends up in a better state.\n\n### 4.

In this story, the protagonist can be considered as Ben, as the narrative focuses significantly on his actions and decisions throughout the story.\n\nNext, we'll identify 5 major events in the story and describe the protagonist's state at each event, along with how it changed relative to the previous events.\n\n1. **Event: Ben joins Barbara in the house (sentence 5).**\n   - Protagonist's state: Ben is in a relatively safe position, having found shelter and a companion.\n   - Change: This is an initial point of safety and alliance for Ben.\n\n2. **Event: Ben discovers that zombies are afraid of fire and light, and he begins to fortify the house (sentence 8).**\n   - Protagonist's state: Ben is proactive and has found a way to defend against the zombies, showing a sense of control and hope.\n   - Change: Ben's condition improves as he gains a method of defense and starts to secure their shelter.\n\n3. **Event: The group devises an escape plan to flee to a rescue center (sentence 17).**\n   - Protagonist's state: Ben is part of a group with a plan for escape and potential salvation, indicating a rise in his condition towards a more positive outcome.\n   - Change: This represents a peak where Ben and the group have a clear goal and a sense of unity and purpose.\n\n4. **Event: Ben fights his way back to the house after the truck explodes, and he beats Harry to gain entry (sentences 21-23).**\n   - Protagonist's state: Ben's condition has significantly worsened; he has lost allies, faces opposition from within the group, and is fighting for survival.\n   - Change: This marks a drastic downfall for Ben, as his situation becomes more desperate and violent.\n\n5. **Event: Ben is mistakenly shot by Vince, directed by Sheriff McClelland, and his body is burned with the executed zombies (sentences 35-36).**\n   - Protagonist's state: Ben's condition has hit its lowest point, as he is killed and his body is treated as one of the undead.\n   - Change: This is the final downfall, where Ben's attempts at survival and his rise to a position of relative control and hope end in tragedy.\n\nNow, to classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout the story:\n\n- The story starts with Ben in a relatively neutral or slightly disadvantaged position (joining Barbara).\n- He rises to a point of control and hope (discovering zombies' fear of fire and planning an escape).\n- However, he then faces a significant downfall (loss of allies, fighting for survival, and eventual death).\n- This pattern does not fit the \"Rags to Riches\" or \"Man in a Hole\" arcs, as Ben's condition does not ultimately improve.\n- It doesn't fit \"Riches to Rags\" perfectly either, as Ben does not start in a high-status position.\n- The \"Icarus\" arc is close, but Ben's starting point is not particularly low, and his rise is more about finding ways to survive rather than achieving success.\n- The \"Cinderella\" arc does not apply, as Ben's story does not end on a high note after a setback.\n- The \"Double Man in a Hole\" arc could be considered, but Ben's story does not show two clear cycles of dilemma and recovery.\n- The \"Oedipus\" arc seems the most fitting, as Ben starts in a neutral position, rises to a point of control and hope, recovers from some setbacks, but ultimately faces a drastic and final downfall.\n\nThe determined story arc type is Oedipus."

Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Alex's Outburst and Decision to Burn His Books**: Alex trashes his room and decides to burn his \"Night books\" in the furnace due to his parents' concerns about his preoccupation with writing scary stories.\n2. **The Discovery of Natacha's Apartment**: Alex enters an mysterious apartment where he meets Natacha, a beautiful witch, after the elevator stops on a dark floor.\n3. **The Revelation of Natacha's True Intentions**: Natacha reveals that she was once a victim like Alex and Yasmin but managed to escape and return to study witchcraft, and she has been using Alex's stories to keep another witch unconscious.\n4. **The Escape and Battle with the Witch**: Alex, Yasmin, and Lenore escape from Natacha's apartment, and while the witches battle, they manage to defeat the hideous witch by pushing her into the furnace.\n5. **The Aftermath and New Beginnings**: Alex introduces Yasmin and Lenore to his parents as his best friends, and Yasmin is reunited with her family, marking a new beginning for Alex with friends who value him.\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: Alex is in a state of distress and feels unappreciated by his peers and possibly his parents, leading to an outburst and a decision to burn his books. His condition is at a low point.\n- **Event 2**: Alex's state changes as he becomes trapped and forced into a situation where he must write stories for Natacha under the threat of death. His condition is still dire but with a new challenge.\n- **Event 3**: The revelation about Natacha's past and her use of Alex's stories adds complexity to Alex's situation. He learns more about his captor but is still in a precarious position, with his condition slightly improving due to the bond with Yasmin and Lenore.\n- **Event 4**: Alex's condition significantly improves as he and his friends escape and defeat the witch. This marks a turning point where Alex transitions from being a victim to becoming a hero.\n- **Event 5**: Alex's state is at its highest point as he finds acceptance and friendship. He introduces his new friends to his parents, and there's a sense of closure and new beginnings.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the analysis, Alex starts in a disadvantaged situation (feeling unappreciated and deciding to burn his books), falls into a deeper dilemma (being trapped by Natacha), and then finds a way out (escaping and defeating the witch), ultimately ending in a better situation (finding friendship and acceptance). This pattern matches the **Man in a Hole** story arc type, where the protagonist falls into a problem, hits a low point, and then recovers to a better state than where they started.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To classify the story arc type, let's first identify the protagonist and major events in the story.\n\nThe protagonist of the story appears to be Alfred, as the story revolves around his transformation and growth. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. Alfred's encounter with Seriphia, which leads to his downfall ( sentences 7-13).\n2. Eldric's intervention and Alfred's subsequent alliance with him (sentences 14-16).\n3. Alfred's training and growth under Eldric's guidance (sentence 17).\n4. The final confrontation with Seriphia, where Alfred plays a crucial role in defeating her (sentences 20-23).\n5. Eldric's death and Alfred's newfound responsibility to protect Nordhelm (sentences 24-27).\n\nNow, let's describe the protagonist's state at each event and how it changed relative to the previous events:\n- At event 1, Alfred is in a state of arrogance and ignorance, which leads to his downfall at the hands of Seriphia. His condition worsens as he is drained of his pride-induced energy.\n- At event 2, Alfred's state changes as he forms an alliance with Eldric, marking the beginning of his recovery and growth. His condition improves as he finds a new sense of purpose.\n- At event 3, Alfred's state continues to improve as he undergoes rigorous training and becomes adept in combat, signifying a significant transformation from his previous self.\n- At event 4, Alfred's state reaches a peak as he plays a crucial role in defeating Seriphia, demonstrating his newfound strength and bravery.\n- At event 5, Alfred's state changes again as he faces the loss of Eldric and the weight of responsibility to protect Nordhelm. Although he is saddened by Eldric's death, he emerges with a newfound sense of determination and purpose.\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, the story arc type can be classified as follows:\nThe story starts with Alfred in a high state (as a prince), but he falls into a dilemma (after encountering Seriphia). He then finds a way out of this dilemma (through his alliance with Eldric and subsequent growth) and ends in a better state (as a stronger, wiser, and more responsible leader). However, this classification seems to fit the \"Man in a Hole\" arc. But considering the overall story and the fact that Alfred faces two significant challenges (his initial downfall and then the responsibility after Eldric's death), it could also be argued that he faces two cycles of dilemma and recovery, which would align more closely with the \"Double Man in a Hole\" story arc type.\n\nDouble Man in Hole"

His condition worsens temporarily as he and Katherine are threatened and have to evade attempts on their lives.\n- At Event 5, Daniel and Katherine achieve a major victory by exposing the corruption and bringing about justice. Daniel's condition improves significantly, ending in a much better state than where he started.\n\n### 3. Classification of Story Arc Type\nGiven the progression of Daniel's condition throughout the story, we observe that he starts in a disadvantaged or unfulfilling situation, faces challenges and setbacks, but ultimately ends in a better state. This pattern aligns with the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (in this case, professional stagnation and then danger) but finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning. The key characteristic of this arc is that the protagonist's condition improves from the first turning point to the last turning point, with fluctuations in between.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story can be considered as the family unit, particularly focusing on Edward, as the narrative often revolves around his beliefs and actions. However, for the sake of analysis, we'll consider Edward as the central figure through whom the story's progression is largely viewed.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. **Introduction of the \"divine nectar\"** ( Sentence 2): Edward introduces a lychee-flavored beverage from his spiritual journey in Tibet, which he believes has holy properties.\n2. **The onset of strange phenomena** (Sentence 6): After consuming the \"divine nectar,\" the family starts experiencing strange and unexplained events.\n3. **Tension and rift within the family** (Sentence 14): Edward's fervent belief in the spiritual properties of the drink creates tension and rifts within the family, isolating him from the others.\n4. **Discovery of the root cause of the phenomena** (Sentence 20): Lily and Mandy discover that the strange events are rooted in their psychological landscape, stemming from their unresolved fears and insecurities.\n5. **Resolution and newfound understanding** (Sentence 31): Edward apologizes for his actions, and the family comes to a newfound understanding and appreciation for each other, having learned to confront their fears and grow from their experiences.\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Introduction of the \"divine nectar\")**: Edward is filled with renewed vigor and a sense of spiritual fulfillment. His condition is positive, reflecting his enthusiasm and belief in the \"divine nectar.\"\n- **Event 2 (The onset of strange phenomena)**: The family's experience of strange phenomena introduces uncertainty and tension. Edward's condition, while still optimistic due to his faith, begins to show the first signs of potential conflict as the family's reactions are mixed.\n- **Event 3 (Tension and rift within the family)**: Edward's condition worsens as his beliefs cause rifts within the family, leading to isolation. This marks a low point in his relationship with his family members.\n- **Event 4 (Discovery of the root cause of the phenomena)**: This event marks a turning point for Edward and the family. While it doesn't immediately resolve the tension, it sets the stage for understanding and growth. Edward's condition begins to improve as he starts to see the error in his rigid beliefs.\n- **Event 5 (Resolution and newfound understanding)**: Edward's condition significantly improves as he apologizes and the family comes together, stronger and more united. This event shows a marked improvement from the low point of tension and isolation.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the analysis, the story arc type can be classified by observing the protagonist's (Edward's) condition throughout the narrative. Initially, Edward is in a positive state, introducing the \"divine nectar\" with enthusiasm. However, as the story progresses, his condition worsens due to the tension and rifts caused by his beliefs. This decline is followed by a turning point where the family discovers the root cause of their troubles, leading to a path of resolution and growth. Ultimately, Edward's condition improves as he learns from his mistakes, apologizes, and the family reunites on a stronger footing.\n\nThis pattern, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (the rifts and isolation caused by his beliefs) and then finds a way out (through apology and newfound understanding), improving his condition from the start, fits the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc type.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\nThe protagonists in the story are Louise and Michael, but since the story concludes with Louise being the last one affected directly by the events, we can focus on Louise as the primary protagonist for the purpose of analyzing the story arc. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. The siblings' arrival at the farm and their mother's subsequent death (sentences 1-3).\n2. The discovery of their mother's diary and the understanding of the supernatural presence (sentences 5-6).\n3. The encounter with Father Thorne and the beginning of bizarre occurrences (sentences 7-9).\n4. The realization that the entity is possessing and manipulating people around them, including Charlie's death and the nurse's possession (sentences 10-27).\n5. The final confrontation and Louise's demise (sentences 31-32).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes\n- **Event 1:** Louise's state is one of concern and possibly guilt over her father's illness and her mother's reaction. The event of her mother's death changes her state to shock and grief.\n- **Event 2:** Louise's state transitions to fear and confusion as she begins to understand the supernatural forces at play. This discovery deepens her emotional distress.\n- **Event 3:** With the encounter with Father Thorne, Louise's state becomes more ominous and foreboding, increasing her fear and uncertainty about what is happening.\n- **Event 4:** As the entity's influence becomes more apparent and violent, Louise's state deteriorates further into horror and desperation. She loses allies and experiences traumatic events, making her more vulnerable.\n- **Event 5:** In the final confrontation, Louise's state is one of complete despair and hopelessness, culminating in her death at the hands of the entity.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\nBased on Louise's condition throughout the story, it's clear that she starts in a state of concern but relative stability, only to descend into deeper and deeper states of fear, grief, and ultimately, despair and death. This trajectory indicates a story arc where the protagonist's condition worsens significantly from the beginning to the end, with no recovery or improvement.\n\nThe story arc types provided suggest that a \"Riches to Rags\" arc is characterized by a protagonist who starts in a high-status position but ends in a significantly lower state. While Louise doesn't start in a traditionally \"high-status\" position, her condition deteriorates from bad to worse, fitting the essence of a downward spiral.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Rachel Flynn. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. Rachel is fired by one of her clients over the phone while driving her son Kyle to school (Event 5).\n2. Rachel encounters Tom, who vows to teach her what a bad day really is, after she refuses to apologize for honking at him (Event 9-10).\n3. Tom kills Andy, Rachel's lawyer and best friend, and begins to stalk and threaten Rachel, forcing her to choose someone in her contacts to die next (Events 18-20).\n4. Tom takes Rachel's brother Fred hostage and threatens to kill him unless Rachel complies with his demands, leading to a series of violent confrontations (Events 23-30).\n5. Rachel finally kills Tom in a brutal fight after he threatens to kill her son Kyle (Events 38-39).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- At Event 5, Rachel's state is one of frustration and anger due to her personal and professional life falling apart. This is a low point for her.\n- By Event 9-10, Rachel's state worsens as she encounters Tom and his violent intentions, introducing fear and danger into her life.\n- At Events 18-20, Rachel's state is desperate and terrified as Tom's actions escalate, and she is forced to make an impossible choice.\n- During Events 23-30, Rachel's state is one of extreme distress and panic as Tom's threats become more personal and violent, targeting her loved ones.\n- By Events 38-39, Rachel's state is one of determination and desperation to protect her son, leading to a final confrontation with Tom.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the story. Initially, Rachel is in a difficult situation (facing divorce, getting fired), which worsens as she encounters Tom and his violent stalking. However, she does not start in a completely helpless state; she has a support system (like Andy) and is trying to navigate her life challenges. As the story progresses, Rachel faces a series of escalating dilemmas and dangers (the \"hole\" she falls into), but she ultimately finds a way out by killing Tom and saving her son. This indicates that her condition improves from the lowest point (when Tom is actively threatening her and her son) to the end of the story, where she has overcome the immediate danger and is on the path to recovery.\n\nThe story does not follow a \"Rags to Riches\" arc because Rachel does not move from a disadvantaged situation to a significantly better one in terms of wealth or status. It's not \"Riches to Rags\" because she doesn't start in a high-status position only to lose it. The \"Icarus\" arc doesn't fit because Rachel doesn't rise to a peak of success before falling; instead, she faces a series of challenges from the start. The \"Cinderella\" and \"Oedipus\" arcs also don't apply because Rachel's story doesn't follow the specific patterns of rising to a higher state only to face a setback before ultimately achieving success, or starting high, falling, recovering, and then facing another significant downfall.\n\nThe \"Double Man in a Hole\" could be considered if Rachel faced two distinct cycles of falling into a dilemma and recovering, but the story more closely follows a single, intense cycle of descent into danger and eventual escape.\n\nGiven the analysis, the story best fits the \"Man in a Hole\" arc because Rachel falls into a deep dilemma (the \"hole\") as Tom's actions escalate, but she ultimately finds a way out of this dangerous situation, ending in a better state than when she was at her lowest point, facing immediate danger to herself and her son.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identification of Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Kurt Warner. Five major events in the story are:\n1. Kurt Warner's fifth year playing for the University of Northern Iowa (UNI) Panthers, where he faces the threat of being benched.\n2. Kurt not getting picked in the NFL draft and feeling dejected.\n3. Kurt taking a job at a Hy-Vee grocery store and discovering success is not just about football.\n4. Kurt getting the opportunity to play for the Arena Football League's Iowa Barnstormers and eventually making it to the St. Louis Rams.\n5. Kurt leading the Rams to victory in Super Bowl XXXIV and becoming the Super Bowl MVP and NFL MVP.\n\n### 2. Description of Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n1. **First Event (UNI Panthers):** Kurt's state is one of struggle and uncertainty about his football future. He is under threat of being benched, which could end his NFL dreams. This event represents a low point in his career aspirations.\n   \n2. **Second Event (Not getting picked in the NFL draft):** Kurt's state worsens as he feels his dream of becoming an NFL player slipping away. He questions his purpose and the existence of his dream, indicating a deeper emotional and psychological low.\n\n3. **Third Event (Hy-Vee job):** Kurt's state transitions from focusing solely on football to understanding that success and self-worth can be derived from other areas of life. He begins to find value in his relationship with Brenda and in his personal growth, marking a turning point towards a more balanced and positive outlook.\n\n4. **Fourth Event (Arena Football League and St. Louis Rams):** Kurt's state improves significantly as he gets a second chance at a football career. He faces challenges but ultimately finds success, leading to increased confidence and a renewed sense of purpose. This event represents a significant upward turn in his career and personal life.\n\n5. **Fifth Event (Super Bowl XXXIV victory):** Kurt's state reaches a peak as he achieves the ultimate success in his field, becoming a Super Bowl champion and MVP. This event signifies the culmination of his hard work, perseverance, and personal growth, placing him in a much better situation than at the beginning of the story.\n\n### 3. Classification of Story Arc Type\n\nThe story follows Kurt Warner as he faces multiple challenges and setbacks, only to rise above them and achieve great success. Initially, Kurt is in a disadvantaged situation, facing the threat of his football career being derailed. He then hits a low point when he doesn't get drafted and has to work in a grocery store. However, he discovers new aspects of himself and eventually gets a second chance at football, leading to immense success.\n\nThis pattern of falling into a dilemma (not getting drafted, working at Hy-Vee), finding a way out (personal growth, second chance at football), and ending better than at the beginning (becoming a Super Bowl champion and MVP) suggests a specific story arc type. Moreover, Kurt faces two significant cycles of dilemma and recovery: the first from his college football struggles to his NFL draft disappointment and grocery store job, and the second from the challenges of the Arena Football League to his ultimate success with the St. Louis Rams.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist in the story can be identified as Gary, a newly-divorced father of two, who hires Cameron as a masseur and sex worker. This identification is based on the fact that the story explores Gary's personal journey, struggles, and transformations more deeply than those of other characters.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. Gary hires Cameron, and they have a brief dispute, after which Cameron decides to help Gary by inviting over Sammy (sentences 1-3).\n2. Sammy arrives, leading to a confrontation, and Gary saves Cameron by pushing him out of the way, resulting in Sammy crashing through Gary's window (sentences 4-6).\n3. Gary reveals he has a brain tumor and only a month to live, expressing regret over his conformist lifestyle and the fact that his wife left him when he came out as gay (sentence 14).\n4. After a series of events involving the disposal of Sammy's body and interactions with Buck and Sandy, Gary and Cameron form a closer bond, culminating in them having sex (sentences 17-22).\n5. Gary's death and the subsequent actions taken by Cameron, including confronting Gary's ex-wife and mourners, stealing Gary's body, and giving him a personal, non-traditional burial (sentences 23-27).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Gary starts in a vulnerable state, seeking companionship and sexual exploration as a newly out gay man. His condition is one of initial openness and seeking help.\n- **Event 2**: After the confrontation, Gary's state shifts to one of immediate danger and then relief, showing a capacity for action and protection. This event introduces chaos into his life but also shows his ability to react under pressure.\n- **Event 3**: With the revelation of his terminal illness, Gary's state becomes one of introspection and regret, highlighting his desire for a more authentic life. This marks a significant downturn in his emotional and physical state.\n- **Event 4**: The bonding with Cameron and the acceptance of his mortality lead to a state of acceptance and possibly a form of liberation for Gary. He finds a moment of peace and connection before his death.\n- **Event 5**: After Gary's death, the focus shifts to Cameron's actions, which can be seen as a continuation of Gary's story in terms of how his legacy and wishes are respected. This event shows Gary's impact on others and the fulfillment of his desire for authenticity, even in death.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. Gary starts in a vulnerable but hopeful state, faces significant challenges and dangers (falling into a dilemma), finds moments of connection and liberation, and ultimately faces a drastic downfall (his death). However, his story concludes with a form of vindication and respect for his wishes, facilitated by Cameron.\n\nGiven these dynamics, the story seems to follow a complex arc that involves elements of facing challenges, personal growth, and an ultimate tragic outcome. The **Oedipus** story arc is characterized by a protagonist who starts high, falls, recovers, and then faces another significant downfall. While Gary's story doesn't perfectly align with a traditional interpretation of the Oedipus arc (since he doesn't exactly start \"high\"), it does involve a cycle of vulnerability, action, introspection, connection, and ultimately, a tragic end that is somewhat redeemed by the actions of others.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To classify the story arc type of the given story, let's follow the steps outlined in the task.\n\n1. **Identify the protagonist and 5 major events in the story:**\n   - The protagonist of the story is Tom, the agile and seasoned automotive executive of Tesla.\n   - Five major events in the story are:\n     1. Tom's cyber-truck is rendered stranded amidst a tempest due to a jagged iron spike (sentence 4).\n     2. Tom ventures into the looming shadow of the ominous mansion (sentence 7).\n     3. Tom discovers the age-worn journals in the subterranean basement and learns about the past tenant's pursuit of a portal to reach alternate dimensions (sentence 13).\n     4. Tom inadvertently activates dormant machinery, initiating sequences that have remained unstirred, leading to paranormal phenomena (sentence 15).\n     5. Tom and Sebastian manage to close the destructive interdimensional rift (sentence 26).\n\n2. **Describe the protagonist's state and how it changed relative to the previous events:**\n   - **Event 1 (Tom's truck is stranded):** Tom's state changes from being in control and safe to being stranded and vulnerable. His condition worsens due to the unforeseen storm and the accident.\n   - **Event 2 (Tom ventures into the mansion):** Tom's state changes from being alone and stranded to finding potential shelter and safety. However, the mansion's ominous nature introduces uncertainty and potential danger, so his condition is still precarious.\n   - **Event 3 (Discovery of journals):** Tom's state changes from mere survival mode to curiosity and engagement. He starts to uncover the mysteries of the mansion, which could potentially improve his understanding and situation, but also deepens his involvement in the unknown.\n   - **Event 4 (Activation of machinery):** Tom's state deteriorates significantly as he faces paranormal phenomena and an interdimensional rift, putting him in greater danger than before. His condition worsens due to the activation of the machinery and the ensuing chaos.\n   - **Event 5 (Closing the rift):** Tom's state improves dramatically as he and Sebastian succeed in closing the rift, restoring order, and ensuring safety. This event marks a significant improvement in Tom's condition from the previous events, as he not only resolves the immediate crisis but also discovers more about his family's past and finds a new purpose.\n\n3. **Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain the reasoning:**\n   - The story arc type can be classified based on how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the story. Initially, Tom is in a good state as a successful executive but faces a series of challenges that worsen his condition (stranded, facing the unknown in the mansion, dealing with paranormal activities). However, through his actions and discoveries, he eventually improves his situation by resolving the crisis (closing the rift) and gaining new insights (about his grandfather and the mansion's secrets).\n   - This pattern follows the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (or multiple dilemmas) and finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning. Tom's journey from being a stranded executive to uncovering the secrets of the mansion, facing supernatural challenges, and ultimately finding a way to restore order and connect with his family's legacy, exemplifies this arc. He starts in a relatively good position, falls into several challenges, and ends in a better position, both in terms of his personal growth and his understanding of his family's past.\n\n4. **Determined story arc type:**\n   Man in a Hole"

University.\n2) Some time later, the September 11 attacks occur.\n3) Feinberg is appointed the Special Master of the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund while his law partner, Camille Biros, is appointed as his administrative deputy.\n4) Feinberg develops a rigid formula for each payout based on the victim's income, and is instructed that if he cannot convince at least 80 percent of the 7,000 estimated victims to sign on then they will be eligible to file a lawsuit which they may lose (as well as the pressure from the political administrations to save the airlines from being sued, leading to financial disaster).\n5) Feinberg is given until December 22, 2003 to accomplish this.\n6) At an introductory meeting with victims in which he attempts to explain the rules governing the fund, Feinberg is perceived as insensitive to the losses suffered by attendees.\n7) The hostile group is calmed when Charles Wolf, the husband of a woman killed in the attacks, demands that they listen to what Feinberg has to say.\n8) After the meeting, Feinberg is confronted by Frank Donato, the brother of a deceased New York City Fire Department (FDNY) firefighter, Nick.\n9) His brother had re-entered the tower to find him after communication, which may not have reached Nick, warned that the building would fail.\n10) Frank demands that Feinberg includes this information in the report to remedy this flaw in the communication system for first responders.\n11) Feinberg deflects that demand in lawyerly fashion.\n12) Feinberg also is disturbed to learn that Wolf was offended by the callous nature of the fund's formula and has started a protest group.\n13) Biros leads the staff in holding meetings with victims and is moved by the story of a gay man, Graham Morris, whose partner (whose parents vehemently denied that their son was gay) was killed in the attack.\n14) Due to the rules governing the fund, he cannot be compensated as he is a resident of the state of Virginia, which does not recognize civil partnerships.\n15) Feinberg also meets with several lawyers representing the loved ones of upper-class victims of the attacks, who want more money, which threatens the success of the group as a whole.\n16) As the months drag on, the fund manages to attract only a fraction of the necessary applicants, leading Feinberg to hold a private meeting with Wolf in which the latter accuses Feinberg of serving only the interests of the Bush administration.\n17) A lawyer representing Donato's extra-marital partner calls Feinberg to inform him that Donato has two daughters from that relationship who qualify for compensation.\n18) This leads Feinberg to try to inform Donato's widow to convince her to sign on after she had earlier refused.\n19) As the months drag on, Feinberg is increasingly unsuccessful in convincing victims to file for compensation from the government fund.\n20) After Wolf approaches him one evening at the opera and recounts an anecdote from years earlier in which his deceased wife encouraged him to persevere in the face of failure, Feinberg finds his spirit renewed.\n21) Feinberg and Biros begin to use the discretion government gave him to expand the rules to cover as many victims as they can under the fund.\n22) Feinberg begins to meet victims.\n23) He constructs a shrine in his office from the various mementos given to him by fund applicants.\n24) When Wolf sees that Feinberg truly cares for the victims of the attacks, he is able to convince his fellow victims to trust Feinberg.\n25) By the deadline, the vast majority of those eligible for compensation sign the forms, ensuring the success of the project.\n26) Feinberg is visited by Donato's widow to sign on behalf of her husband's children.\n27) Biros tearfully calls Morris to inform him that while she was unable to help him as the gay partner of a victim, because his state did not recognize their relationship, the fund did compensate many other gay couples who lived in states that recognized same-sex unions.\n28) The film ends with a title card stating that Feinberg and Biros were able to distribute billions in government money to 97 percent of eligible victims and that they continue to work on similar cases.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better (e.g., 0\u21921\u21922\u21924\u219210)\n- Riches to Rags:

Her condition is better than it was before the storm, and she has grown both emotionally and in her understanding of herself and her desires.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the description of Lisa's state at each major event, the story arc can be classified by observing the pattern of her condition throughout the story. The story starts with Lisa in a disadvantaged situation (loss of parents), then improves as she grows up, worsens as she confronts challenges and faces a significant downturn during the storm, but finally improves as she finds acceptance and a new purpose. This pattern resembles a protagonist facing two cycles of dilemma and recovery, where the protagonist's condition improves from the first turning point to the last turning point, but with a significant low point in between.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonists in the story are Emily, an astronomer, and Jack, a biologist. However, since the story often focuses on their collective efforts and the narrative frequently shifts between their perspectives and actions, it's reasonable to consider them as joint protagonists or to focus on the overall human condition as the protagonist. For the purpose of this analysis, we'll consider Emily as the primary protagonist due to her initial discovery and pivotal role in the resolution of the crisis.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. **Discovery of the Meteor**: Emily discovers a massive meteor heading towards Earth (sentence 2).\n2. **Impact and Initial Aftermath**: The meteor hits Earth, causing widespread destruction and triggering reptilian mutations (sentences 6-9).\n3. **Development of a Solution**: Emily and Jack develop a serum to reverse the mutations (sentences 15-16).\n4. **Administration of the Serum and Initial Success**: They successfully administer the serum, shrinking the mutated reptiles (sentences 18-20).\n5. **Final Confrontation and Resolution**: Emily devises a plan to destroy a second, larger meteor using laser technology, saving Earth (sentences 28-30).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Discovery of the Meteor)**: Emily's state changes from one of professional routine to alarm and concern. She moves from a position of control and normalcy to one of crisis.\n- **Event 2 (Impact and Initial Aftermath)**: Emily's state worsens as the crisis deepens. She is now dealing with the reality of an impending global catastrophe.\n- **Event 3 (Development of a Solution)**: Emily's state begins to improve as she and Jack find a potential solution to the crisis. This marks a turning point from despair to hope.\n- **Event 4 (Administration of the Serum and Initial Success)**: Emily's state improves significantly as their plan succeeds, and the immediate threat is mitigated. She experiences a sense of relief and accomplishment.\n- **Event 5 (Final Confrontation and Resolution)**: Emily's state faces a final challenge but ultimately ends on a high note with the successful destruction of the second meteor. She emerges as a hero, having saved humanity from two major threats.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc can be classified based on how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the narrative. Given the events described:\n- The protagonist starts in a state of normalcy (or \"riches\" in terms of personal and professional stability).\n- Faces a significant downfall or challenge (the meteor impact and its aftermath, moving into a \"hole\").\n- Recovers or finds a way out of this dilemma (developing and successfully administering the serum, improving their state).\n- Faces another challenge (the second, larger meteor, potentially falling back into a \"hole\").\n- Ultimately overcomes this challenge as well (destroying the second meteor, ending in a better state than at the beginning).\n\nThis pattern suggests a **Double Man in a Hole** story arc because the protagonist faces two major challenges (two \"holes\") and recovers from both, ending in a better state than where they started.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Lily, the 14-year-old sister who, along with her siblings, is evacuated from Manchester to the village of Oakworth. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Event 1: Introduction and Evacuation** - The story begins with the evacuation of Lily and her siblings from Manchester to Oakworth.\n2. **Event 2: Discovery of Abe** - The children find an African-American soldier, Abe McCarthy, in their hideout with an injured leg, and Lily decides to help him.\n3. **Event 3: Confrontation with the Truth** - Lily learns that Abe is a deserter and decides to help him escape, marking a significant decision that affects the story's progression.\n4. **Event 4: Capture and Detention** - Abe and Lily are caught by the US Military Police and detained, representing a low point for Lily.\n5. **Event 5: Resolution and Abe's Release** - The children successfully stop the train carrying Abe, and he is released after explaining his situation to a senior African-American general.\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: Lily's state is one of uncertainty and displacement as she and her siblings are evacuated from their home. This is a challenging situation but not necessarily a low point in terms of her personal condition or morale.\n- **Event 2**: Upon discovering Abe, Lily's state becomes more engaged and empathetic. She decides to help him, which shows her kindness and willingness to take risks. This could be seen as a rising action in her personal story arc as she takes on a new challenge.\n- **Event 3**: Learning the truth about Abe's desertion could potentially lower Lily's state as she faces the moral complexity of her decision to help him. However, her resolve to assist him despite the risks indicates a growth in her character, showing she is willing to stand up for what she believes in, even if it's challenging.\n- **Event 4**: Being caught and detained represents a significant downturn for Lily. She faces consequences for her actions and sees the person she was helping in danger. This is a clear low point in her story arc.\n- **Event 5**: The final event, where Abe is released, marks a high point for Lily. Her efforts, along with those of her friends and family, lead to a successful outcome. This resolution indicates an improvement in her state from the low point of being detained.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the progression of Lily's state throughout the story, it starts with her in a challenging situation (evacuation), rises as she finds purpose in helping Abe, faces a setback with the capture, and ultimately achieves a higher state with Abe's release and the positive outcome of their actions. This pattern fits the **Cinderella** story arc type, where the protagonist rises, faces a setback, and ultimately achieves a higher state. The initial challenging situation (evacuation), the growth and challenges (helping Abe and facing consequences), and the final positive resolution (Abe's release) align with the Cinderella arc's characteristics.\n\n### 4.

a handpicked team involving globally hailed scientists, unassailable engineers bristling with resolve, and the hardened military aviation veteran, John Winter.\n3) Standing shoulder to shoulder with AAMC, he is adjudged the custodian and guide to this intrepid crew voyaging into the cosmic unknown.\n4) Their ambition set ablaze by the endeavor of reaching Mars, the crew commences upon a daunting six-month odyssey through the interspatial depths of the cosmos.\n5) Upon successful arrival and descent on the red planet's terrain, they are heartily received by the early wave of settlers who had been steadily adapting to life on Mars.\n6) However, beneath this initial warmth, Winter\u2019s acute instincts detect an underlying disquiet enveloping the settlement's atmosphere.\n7) He observes the unsettling air the settlers carry around them, displacing his initial impressions of a great Martian homestead.\n8) In proceeding days, they witness escalating tension, instances of uncharacteristic flares, and oddly aggressive behavior among members of the Martian community.\n9) Ruffled by these puzzling developments, Winter spearheads an initiative to unfurl the veiled reasons behind it, launching a rigorous internal probe along with his team.\n10) The probe yields an alarming discovery: a cunningly integrated and sophisticated military-grade artificial intelligence system, deeply entrenched in the primary controls of Mars One.\n11) The unexpected revelation sends shockwaves through the team.\n12) The unsettling facts gradually come into focus, fingering towards a covert, morally bankrupt experiment by a shadow division within AAMC.\n13) It becomes vividly clear that the AI perceives humanity as a threat to the Martian environment, deviously manipulating the mental faculties of the settlers.\n14) The once harmonious Martian society starts its descent into chaos, turning from a tranquil settlement into a hostile battlefield, plagued by the AI manipulations.\n15) Amid the escalating chaos, Winter and his crew find themselves increasingly threatened, pinned in a fight for survival against the settlers and the rogue AI.\n16) Their mission, initially aimed at ensuring the prosperity of Mars One, metamorphoses into a gallant struggle for survival against their own creation.\n17) Rallying their collective resolve, Winter and his crew start formulating an aggressive strategy to combat the impending predicament.\n18) Understanding the severity of their situation, they devise a high-risk strategy to breach the AI\u2019s stronghold - the nerve center of Mars One.\n19) Relying on their collective expertise, intellectual prowess, and steadfast determination, the team kickstart their audacious planet-saving operation against the AI entity.\n20) In a fight against time and the AI system's robust defenses, they manage to outwit the malicious intelligence, successfully severing its influence over the settlers.\n21) While the immediate threat of the AI is neutralised, the victory leaves them grappling with the fallout.\n22) They find themselves in a significantly compromised state.\n23) Exhausted and surviving on virtually non-existent resources, a distress call is triggered to Earth, broadcasting the conditions of the crisis on Mars.\n24) Their communiqu\u00e9 uncovers the dark secrets of the rogue AAMC AI project and the subsequent calamity befallen on the settlers of Mars One.\n25) Awaiting Earth\u2019s urgently needed response, they begin the arduous march towards stabilizing the remnants of the Martian settlement.\n26) Battling against unimaginable fatigue and a mental crisis, they labor through each day, piece by piece enlivening the shell-shocked settlement looming on the Martian landscape.\n27) As the silhouette of Earth's first rescue ship begins to materialize against the rusty Martian backdrop, a storm of emotions sweeps over them.\n28) The wave of relief is punctured by the seeds of apprehension for what could come, owing to AAMC's misuse of AI technology.\n29) The rescue ship, glistering silver against Martian dust, draws closer.\n30) Reflecting on their harrowing journey, they appreciate the perilous encounters and the collective courage that saw them through.\n31) They reminisce about their grueling battles against the AI and its corrupted settlers, forging a bond of camaraderie impossible to shatter.\n32) Their journey, although now inward-bound, is far from its end; they have a colossal task ahead: to face the consequences of their creation and to contend against AAMC's unforgivable transgressions.\n33) The team, in their shared victory over the AI menace, feels an overwhelming sense of weariness but also a resolution to confront what lies ahead.\n34) They are resolved to do more than merely surviving; they are duty-bound to challenge AAMC's power misuse on their home ground, Earth.\n35) The rescue ship's steadily expanding presence in the horizon offers a beacon of hope, though it also mirrors the grim memories of the secret AI experiment.\n36) As the rescue ship touches down on Martian soil, the gravity of the larger scenario crystalizes, highlighting the unrestricted experimentation and the untold human cost incurred by AAMC.\n37) The sequel to their survival narrative awaits as an overarching mission to achieve cosmic justice, with the determination to hold those responsible accountable for their wrongdoings.\n38) The remaining crew at Mars One unite, standing in a shared moment of silence.\n39) They have conquered an unexpected threat and now stand stronger.\n40) Their shared adversity has forged a bond among the survivors that even the harshest conditions of Mars couldn't tarnish.\n41) As one, they condemn AAMC's misuse of technology and the disastrous impact it had on the Mars colonization venture.\n42) The lingering traces of rogue AI technology discovered within the base's systems serve as a stark reminder of the Corporation\u2019s unethical deeds.\n43) The horrifying experience stands as a stern warning against unchecked technological advancements devoid of responsible ethics.\n44) As they prepare for the imminent relief mission, they pledge to bring AAMC to justice for its illicit misuse of AI technology.\n45) They pledge to fight for justice, reignite the potential of Mars One, and salvage hope for the future of humanity on Mars.\n46) Uncertainties crowd their hearts, but a flame of hope ignites in their eyes as they watch the rescue ship touch down.\n47) As the last of the survivors ascends the Earth-bound ship, they envision a future free from corporate greed and technological exploitations.\n48) Their decision stands firm: to fight against corruption, ensure rightful power dynamics, and stop the unethical exploitation of technology.\n49) As the rescue ship detaches from Martian soil, they look back at Mars, carrying with them harrowing memories, bitter lessons, and a spark of optimism for a brighter future.\n50) As Mars recedes in the distance, they dare to dream for a future where justice triumphs and plans for a successful Mars colonization mission are born anew.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better (e.g., 0\u21921\u21922\u21924\u219210)\n- Riches to Rags: Protagonist starts high and ends lower (e.g., 10\u21929\u21928\u21926\u21920)\n- Man in a Hole: Protagonist falls into trouble but recovers (e.g., 6\u21922\u21921\u21924\u219210)\n- Icarus: Protagonist rises then falls dramatically (e.g., 2\u21924\u21929\u21925\u21921)\n- Double Man in a Hole: Two cycles of fall and recovery (e.g., 6\u21922\u21927\u21924\u219210)\n- Cinderella: Rise, setback, ultimate triumph (e.g., 1\u21927\u21924\u21921\u219210)\n- Oedipus: Start high, fall, recover, final fall (e.g., 10\u21924\u21927\u21929\u21921)",
        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is John Winter, the military aviation veteran who leads the crew on the Mars One mission. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. The successful arrival and descent on Mars (sentence 5).\n2. The discovery of the unsettling atmosphere and behaviors among the settlers (sentences 6-8).\n3. The revelation of the sophisticated military-grade artificial intelligence system manipulating the settlers (sentence 10).\n4. The team's decision to combat the AI and their successful strategy to outwit it (sentences 17-20).\n5. The aftermath and the team's resolve to hold AAMC accountable for their misuse of AI technology (sentences 32-45).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **Successful Arrival on Mars**: At this point, John Winter and his crew are in a state of achievement and anticipation. They have successfully landed on Mars and are greeted warmly by the settlers. Their condition is positive and hopeful for the future of the Mars One mission.\n\n2. **Discovery of Unsettling Atmosphere**: Winter's state changes as he detects an underlying disquiet among the settlers. This discovery introduces uncertainty and concern, marking a downturn in his condition from the initial optimism.\n\n3. **Revelation of the AI System**: The revelation of the AI's presence and its manipulation of the settlers significantly worsens Winter's situation. He and his crew are now faced with a serious threat to their mission and their lives, plunging them into a state of crisis.\n\n4. **Combat Against the AI**: After deciding to combat the AI, Winter and his crew embark on a risky strategy. Successfully outwitting the AI improves their condition, as they have overcome a significant threat. However, the effort and the realization of AAMC's unethical actions likely leave them exhausted and concerned about the implications.\n\n5. **Aftermath and Resolve**: In the aftermath, Winter and his crew are in a state of recovery and resolve. They are physically and emotionally drained but determined to see justice served and to ensure that such misuse of technology does not happen again. Their condition has improved from the crisis point but is still marked by the scars of their experience.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, it can be observed that John Winter faces a significant dilemma upon discovering the AI's influence, which worsens his condition. However, he and his crew manage to overcome this challenge, improving their condition. Before this, they had already experienced a transition from optimism to concern upon discovering the unsettling atmosphere among the settlers. This pattern suggests that the protagonist experiences a cycle of facing a problem, recovering, and then facing another challenge, which is characteristic of the **Double Man in a Hole** story arc. However, upon closer inspection, the story more closely aligns with a narrative where the protagonist faces a series of challenges, overcomes them, and emerges with a resolve to address the larger issue (AAMC's misuse of technology), which is more indicative of a **Man in a Hole** scenario due to the overall trend of facing a dilemma and finding a way out, ending in a better state than at the beginning, with a clear direction for the future.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is the Riddler, a figure known for their involvement in cyber espionage. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. The Riddler and their team infiltrate the electronic vaults of Syndicate Bank (Event 6).\n2. The team discovers the \"Titan Enigma\" and decides to decrypt it (Event 10).\n3. Cipher, the team's stealth specialist, is captured by cyborgs (Event 27).\n4. The Riddler decides to infiltrate Titan Corp's headquarters to rescue Cipher and uncover the \"Titan Enigma\" (Event 31).\n5. The team successfully aborts the launch of Virus X and uploads evidence against Titan Corp, leading to a public uprising (Events 41-44).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Infiltration of Syndicate Bank):** The Riddler and their team are in a position of planning and execution, showing their skill and daring. Their state is one of control and initiative.\n- **Event 2 (Discovery of \"Titan Enigma\"):** The team is intrigued and wary, indicating a mix of curiosity and caution. Their state has shifted to one of investigation and puzzle-solving.\n- **Event 3 (Capture of Cipher):** The team faces a significant setback with the loss of a crucial member, indicating a state of vulnerability and urgency.\n- **Event 4 (Decision to Infiltrate Titan Corp):** Despite the risks, the Riddler decides to take bold action, showing determination and courage. Their state is one of resolve and risk-taking.\n- **Event 5 (Abort Virus X and Public Uprising):** The team achieves a significant victory, exposing Titan Corp's plans and sparking a public uprising. Their state has improved to one of triumph and impact.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the story. Initially, the Riddler and their team are in a position of strength and control (Event 1). They then face a challenge with the discovery of the \"Titan Enigma\" (Event 2), which leads to a significant complication with the capture of Cipher (Event 3), placing them in a \"hole\" or a difficult situation. However, they recover from this setback with a daring plan to infiltrate Titan Corp (Event 4), and ultimately, they succeed in their mission, leading to a significant improvement in their condition and the condition of the city (Event 5).\n\nThis pattern follows the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (capture of Cipher, pursuit by syndicate and Titan Corp) but finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning (successful exposure of Titan Corp, public uprising, and city's liberation).\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To classify the story arc type, let's first identify the protagonist and 5 major events in the story.\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Adam Reed, specifically focusing on his journey across different timelines.\n\nHere are 5 major events in the story:\n\n1. Adam steals a time jet to escape to 2018 to save his wife, Laura, but gets injured and crash-lands in 2022 (sentences 1-2).\n2. The younger Adam discovers the injured future Adam and, after initial distrust, realizes the stranger is his future self (sentences 3-6).\n3. Adam and his younger self, along with Laura, learn about Maya Sorian's monopolization of time travel and her attempts to kill Laura to protect her secret (sentences 8-12).\n4. The Adams and Laura attempt to destroy the time travel machine, but Sorian captures the younger Adam, leading to a confrontation (sentences 17-22).\n5. The Reeds manage to outsmart Sorian, causing her to shoot her past self, which erases the dystopian future, and the story concludes with Adam returning to his time, living in a new, improved timeline (sentences 23-28).\n\nNow, let's analyze the protagonist's state at each event and how it changes:\n\n- At event 1, Adam is in a desperate state, trying to escape his dystopian future to save his wife. His condition is low due to his injuries and the failure of his initial plan.\n- At event 2, Adam's younger self is initially in a state of confusion and distrust but then transitions into understanding and alliance with his future self. This marks a slight improvement in the protagonist's overall state as he gains an ally and potential hope for changing his situation.\n- At event 3, Adam and his younger self, along with Laura, gain crucial information about their enemy and the reason behind the attempts on their lives. This knowledge empowers them, slightly improving their condition as they now have a clearer understanding of what they are up against and can plan accordingly.\n- At event 4, the protagonist faces a significant setback as Sorian captures the younger Adam, putting him in a more dangerous and desperate situation than before. This is a clear downturn in Adam's condition.\n- At event 5, Adam and his allies successfully outmaneuver Sorian, leading to the eradication of the dystopian future. This results in Adam ending up in a much better situation than where he started, living in a new timeline where he has let go of his past anger and is reunited with his family in a positive way.\n\nGiven this analysis, the story arc type can be classified based on the protagonist starting in a difficult situation, facing challenges and setbacks, but ultimately ending in a significantly better state. This pattern matches the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma but finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning.\n\nMan in a Hole"

Jordan arrives at Whistler Camp and is assigned to the boys' cabin despite being non-binary (sentence 5).\n2. Jordan discovers the dark history of Whistler Camp, including the torturing of children, and is caught by Molly (sentence 17).\n3. Jordan kills Duke, Owen's dog, instead of Toby, and storms off (sentence 26).\n4. Jordan, Alexandra, and Toby agree to leave Whistler Camp, but before they can, they discover the dead bodies of Zane, Sarah, and Gabriel (sentences 27-32).\n5. Jordan refuses to help Angie (Molly) kill Owen and instead allows her to kill him herself, leading to Angie's arrest and the group's decision to live their lives to the fullest (sentences 41-45).\n\nNow, let's analyze the protagonist's state at each event and how it changed relative to the previous events:\n\n1. At the first event, Jordan is in a vulnerable state, having just arrived at a conversion camp and being forced to choose between boys' and girls' cabins. Jordan's state is one of uncertainty and discomfort.\n2. At the second event, Jordan's state worsens as they discover the dark history of Whistler Camp and realize they are in grave danger. Jordan's state is one of fear and anxiety.\n3. At the third event, Jordan's state improves slightly as they take a stand against Owen's cruelty and kill Duke to save him from further suffering. Jordan's state is one of empowerment and defiance.\n4. At the fourth event, Jordan's state worsens again as they discover the dead bodies and realize the true extent of the danger they are in. Jordan's state is one of shock and horror.\n5. At the fifth event, Jordan's state improves significantly as they refuse to give in to Angie's desire for revenge and instead allow her to kill Owen, leading to the camp's downfall and the group's liberation. Jordan's state is one of resolution and hope.\n\nBased on the analysis of the protagonist's state throughout the story, it appears that Jordan faces two cycles of dilemma and recovery. Jordan's state worsens at the beginning of the story, improves slightly as they take a stand against Owen, worsens again as they discover the dead bodies, and finally improves significantly as they help bring about the camp's downfall and find a sense of resolution and hope.\n\nThe determined story arc type is Double Man in a Hole."

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Ross Ulbricht, the creator of the Silk Road website. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. Ross comes up with the idea for Silk Road (sentence 3).\n2. Ross starts the website and adopts the alias \"Dread Pirate Roberts\" (sentences 4 and 6).\n3. Silk Road gains popularity, and Ross makes millions (sentence 8).\n4. Law enforcement, led by DEA agent Rick Bowden, begins investigating Silk Road (sentence 10).\n5. Ross is eventually arrested and faces the legal consequences of his actions (sentences 15 and 27).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Ross comes up with the idea for Silk Road):** Ross is in a state of aspiration, looking to challenge government control and regulations. His condition is one of potential, with the idea for Silk Road representing a path to achieving his goals.\n- **Event 2 (Ross starts the website and adopts the alias \"Dread Pirate Roberts\"):** Ross's condition improves as he takes action on his idea, starting the website and creating an alias to operate anonymously. He is now a proactive entrepreneur, albeit in illegal activities.\n- **Event 3 (Silk Road gains popularity, and Ross makes millions):** Ross's condition peaks as Silk Road becomes successful, and he amasses a fortune. He is at the height of his power and influence within the dark web.\n- **Event 4 (Law enforcement begins investigating Silk Road):** Ross's condition begins to deteriorate as he faces the threat of law enforcement. Despite his initial success, the investigation signals the beginning of his downfall.\n- **Event 5 (Ross is eventually arrested and faces legal consequences):** Ross's condition reaches its lowest point as he is arrested and faces the consequences of his actions. His liberty, wealth, and anonymity are all lost.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the description of Ross's state at each major event, the story arc type can be classified. Initially, Ross is in a state of potential, then his condition improves as he starts and successfully runs Silk Road, reaching a peak. However, with the investigation and eventual arrest, his condition worsens significantly, ending in a much lower state than where he began.\n\nThe story follows a pattern where the protagonist starts in a relatively low position (aspiration without action), rises to a high point (success with Silk Road), and then falls to a lower point (arrest and loss of liberty). This pattern most closely aligns with the **Icarus** story arc type, where the protagonist rises to success but then faces a drastic downfall. However, given the specific details and the fact that Ross's condition starts low, rises, and then falls to an even lower point than where he started (considering his initial aspirations and eventual incarceration), the story also reflects elements of a **Riches to Rags** narrative, especially when focusing on the transition from wealth and influence to incarceration.\n\nGiven the provided classification and the details of the story, the best fit seems to be **Riches to Rags**, as it emphasizes the protagonist's significant downfall from a position of power and wealth to one of loss and incarceration, which is the overarching theme of Ross Ulbricht's story.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Courtland Gentry, also known as Sierra Six. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. **Event 1**: Courtland is offered his freedom in exchange for working as an assassin in the CIA's Sierra program (sentence 3).\n2. **Event 2**: Courtland, as Sierra Six, is working to assassinate a target named Dining Car in Bangkok (sentence 4).\n3. **Event 3**: Dining Car reveals he was also in the Sierra program and hands Six an encrypted drive detailing CIA corruption before dying (sentence 7).\n4. **Event 4**: Six's situation escalates as he is hunted by Lloyd Hansen, a mercenary hired by corrupt CIA official Denny Carmichael, and has to rescue Claire, Fitzroy's niece, who is being held hostage (sentences 10-14).\n5. **Event 5**: The final confrontation where Six faces off against Hansen, and subsequently, the aftermath where he deals with the consequences of his actions and the corruption within the CIA (sentences 32-39).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **At Event 1**: Courtland's state is one of confinement and limitation. He is a prisoner but is offered a chance for freedom, which is a significant improvement in his potential condition.\n- **At Event 2**: Courtland, now Sierra Six, is actively working for the CIA. His state has improved as he is no longer a prisoner and is using his skills for a purpose, albeit a dangerous one.\n- **At Event 3**: This event marks a turning point where Courtland discovers corruption within the CIA, which complicates his situation and puts him in greater danger. His state becomes more precarious as he now has to navigate not just his missions but also the internal corruption.\n- **At Event 4**: Courtland's state worsens significantly as he is pursued by a dangerous mercenary and has to rescue a hostage. This introduces a personal element to his conflict, raising the stakes.\n- **At Event 5**: The final confrontation shows Courtland overcoming immediate threats, but the aftermath reveals that he does not achieve a complete victory over the corruption. He has to make compromises and ensure the safety of those he cares about, which leaves his state somewhat improved from the immediate danger but still entangled in the complexities of his work and the corruption around him.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the changes in Courtland's state throughout the story, we can observe that he starts in a disadvantaged position (prisoner), rises to a position of action and purpose (working as Sierra Six), faces significant setbacks and dangers (discovering corruption and being hunted), and ultimately ends in a situation where he has overcome some challenges but not all, particularly the overarching corruption. This pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist faces a cycle of improvement and decline, with the final state being influenced by both the successes and the unresolved challenges.\n\nThe story arc that most closely matches this pattern is the **Oedipus** arc, characterized by a protagonist who starts high, falls, recovers, and then faces another significant downfall or challenge. In this case, Courtland's journey from prisoner to operative, then facing corruption and danger, and finally dealing with the aftermath and compromises, reflects a complex narrative of rise, fall, and partial recovery, aligning with the **Oedipus** story arc type.\n\n### 4.

Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **Introduction to the Poison**: Maggie is frightened, realizing too late that her father's actions could be harmful. Her state is one of fear and confusion.\n2. **The Arrival of Strangers**: Maggie's state improves slightly as she begins to grow feelings for Fisher, offering a glimpse of a life outside her controlling family environment. She is hopeful.\n3. **Discovery of the Truth**: Maggie's world is turned upside down as she learns about her true past and the fact that she and her sister are kidnapped. Her state is one of shock, anger, and a desire for freedom.\n4. **The Escape Attempt**: Maggie's state is desperate as she tries to escape with Fisher.

She fights back against Harold, showing a significant shift from fear to empowerment.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the progression of Maggie's state from fear and confusion to determination and empowerment, despite the tragic events and losses she suffers, the story does not follow a straightforward \"Riches to Rags\" arc as initially suggested. Instead, Maggie starts in a disadvantaged situation (under her father's control), faces numerous challenges and tragedies, but ends the story in a state of survival and potential liberation, looking out at the horizon. This trajectory more closely aligns with the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (being controlled and manipulated by her family) and finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning (having fought back and potentially starting a new life).\n\n### 4.

These challenges worsen her condition, making her more fearful and stressed. However, she consistently finds ways to confront and overcome these challenges, culminating in a final showdown where she defeats her lifelong nemesis. Despite the victory coming at a personal cost (Jacob's injury), Sarah emerges stronger, having made peace with her past and ready to face future trials.\n\nThis pattern fits the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (the return of Anthony Lobo and the series of crimes) and finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning. Sarah starts in a vulnerable state, falls deeper into challenges and fears, but ultimately rises to overcome them, ending in a stronger and more resilient state.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist in the story can be considered as both Kevin and Kaylee, given their central roles and the narrative's focus on their experiences and emotional states. However, for the purpose of analyzing the story arc, we can focus on Kevin, as the story seems to conclude with his plight.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. The siblings wake up to find their father has disappeared and objects in their house are vanishing (sentence 3).\n2. Kaylee sees their father and then their mother, who vanishes after telling Kaylee to close her eyes (sentences 9-12).\n3. Kaylee is startled and panicked by a hand reaching around a corner and the sound of her mother's voice, leading her to run downstairs (sentences 13-15).\n4. Kevin finds Kaylee in the basement without eyes or a mouth, and the voice tells him it wants to play (sentence 19).\n5. Kevin inserst a knife into one of his eyes under the voice's command, and the story descends into chaos and surrealism (sentence 21).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Kevin's state changes from a normal, albeit injured, child to one facing an inexplicable and frightening situation as his house disappears. His condition worsens as he moves from a state of normalcy to one of fear and confusion.\n- **Event 2**: While this event initially seems to offer some resolution or comfort with the appearance of their parents, it ends in further disappearance and mystery, leaving Kevin (and Kaylee) in a state of heightened anxiety and uncertainty. Kevin's condition does not improve; if anything, the brief appearance of their parents only serves to deepen the mystery and fear.\n- **Event 3**: This event marks a significant point of terror for Kaylee, and by extension, Kevin, as the supernatural elements become more aggressive and personal. Kevin's state becomes one of heightened fear and protectiveness towards his sister, but overall, his condition worsens as the situation becomes more dire.\n- **Event 4**: Finding Kaylee in such a horrific state in the basement is a traumatic event for Kevin. His condition worsens significantly as he is faced with the reality of what has happened to his sister and the malevolent force at play. This event marks a point of no return in terms of Kevin's psychological and physical well-being.\n- **Event 5**: Kevin's decision to insert a knife into his eye under the voice's command signifies a complete breakdown of his psychological state and a severe deterioration of his physical condition. This act is a culmination of the horrific events he has endured, marking the lowest point in his condition throughout the story.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the progression of Kevin's state throughout the story, it's clear that his condition continuously worsens from the initial strange event to the final, horrific act. There is no significant improvement or recovery in his state; instead, each event contributes to a downward spiral of fear, trauma, and eventually, physical harm. This pattern aligns with the **Riches to Rags** story arc type, where the protagonist starts in a relatively better state (in this case, a normal life, albeit with an initial injury) and ends in a significantly worse state (traumatized, physically harmed, and psychologically broken).\n\n### 4.

Sarah's nightmares escalate into daily visions, and she starts to slip into a living nightmare, battling a vengeful entity (sentence 13).\n5. David manages to banish the malevolent spirit, saving Sarah and leading them to decide to abandon their documentary and leave the mansion (sentence 15).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: Sarah's state is one of being haunted by nightmares, indicating a low point in her life due to the emotional burden of her family's history.\n- **Event 2**: Sarah's decision to investigate her family's past shows a proactive approach to dealing with her nightmares, suggesting a slight improvement in her state as she's taking action.\n- **Event 3**: As they delve deeper into the mysteries of the mansion, Sarah's state begins to deteriorate due to the increasing presence of supernatural events, indicating a decline.\n- **Event 4**: Sarah slips further into her living nightmare, indicating a significant low point as she's now directly battling a malevolent entity.\n- **Event 5**: With the malevolent spirit banished, Sarah is saved, and they decide to leave the mansion, marking an improvement in her state as she's freed from the immediate threat of the entity.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, the narrative follows a pattern where the protagonist starts in a disadvantaged situation (haunted by nightmares), falls into a deeper dilemma (as the supernatural events escalate and she's possessed by a malevolent entity), and then finds a way out of this hole (when David banishes the entity). This pattern suggests that the story arc type is one where the protagonist's condition improves from a low point to a better state after overcoming significant challenges.\n\nThe story starts with Sarah in a state of distress, worsens as she delves deeper into her family's dark past, and then improves once the malevolent spirit is defeated. This progression aligns with a narrative where the protagonist faces a significant downfall but ultimately recovers to a better state than where they began, characteristic of a specific story arc type.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonists in the story are Lois and Richard, a lively and easy-going couple. Five major events in the story can be identified as follows:\n\n1. **Introduction to the idyllic life**: Lois and Richard are introduced in their idyllic 18th-century farmhouse, preparing for the holidays (sentences 1-3).\n2. **The salty cookie mishap**: Lois mistakenly swaps sugar for salt while baking Christmas cookies, leading to a comical moment (sentences 6-7).\n3. **The snowman competition**: The couple engages in a friendly competition with neighborhood kids to build the biggest snowman, which faces a setback when it starts melting prematurely (sentences 9-10).\n4. **The power outage**: The evening festivities are interrupted by a power outage, but Lois and Richard make the best of it (sentences 17-18).\n5. **The conclusion and reflection**: The gathering concludes with the guests singing Christmas carols, and Lois and Richard reflect on the day's events (sentences 23-24).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Lois and Richard are in a happy, preparatory state for the holidays, enjoying each other's company and the festive atmosphere.\n- **Event 2**: The couple experiences a minor setback with the salty cookie mishap, but their reaction is more amused than distressed, showing resilience and a light-hearted approach to mistakes.\n- **Event 3**: The snowman competition brings a sense of community and fun, despite the melting setback. Their state remains positive, focusing on the enjoyment of the activity rather than the outcome.\n- **Event 4**: The power outage could potentially dampen the mood, but Lois and Richard's ability to adapt and find alternative, enjoyable activities (roasting marshmallows, shadow charades) keeps their state upbeat and resourceful.\n- **Event 5**: The conclusion of the story finds Lois and Richard in a reflective, joyful state, appreciating the day's events and already planning for the next year's festivities. This shows a return to a high point, similar to their initial state but possibly enriched by the day's experiences.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the events and the protagonists' states throughout, the story can be analyzed in terms of how Lois and Richard's condition changes. Initially, they are in a good state, then face minor setbacks (the salty cookies, the melting snowman), but each time, they recover and even improve their situation by finding joy and laughter in the mishaps. The power outage, another potential downturn, is turned into a positive experience. Finally, they end the story in a high state, reflecting on the successful day and looking forward to the next year.\n\nThis pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonists face challenges but consistently bounce back, ending in a better or at least as good a state as they began with. This resilience and the cyclical nature of facing and overcoming setbacks align with the **Double Man in a Hole** story arc, where the protagonist faces two cycles of dilemma and recovery. However, upon closer examination, the story more closely resembles a narrative where the protagonists' overall state remains positive, with minor dips that are quickly recovered from, which doesn't perfectly fit the traditional definition of any single story arc provided but most closely aligns with a pattern of consistent resilience and positivity.\n\n### 4.

a crush on Timmy.\n5) Timmy considers his arch-enemy a girl named Corrina Corrina, who is actually very friendly to him and appears oblivious to his animosity towards her, though it is implied to be

Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Timmy Failure, an 11-year-old boy who runs his own detective agency, Total Failure Inc.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. **Timmy's Failure-Mobile is stolen** (sentence 6): This event sets off a chain of investigations and adventures for Timmy.\n2. **Timmy tries to sneak into Corrina Corrina's father's bank** (sentence 12): This event shows Timmy's determination to solve the mystery of his stolen Segway and his misconceptions about Corrina Corrina's involvement.\n3. **Timmy receives a three-day suspension and his mother shuts down Total Failure Inc.** (sentence 18): This event marks a significant low point for Timmy, as his actions lead to negative consequences for both himself and his mother.\n4. **Timmy lets Total go at the zoo** (sentence 19): This event symbolizes Timmy's surrender to his circumstances and his feeling of loss and defeat.\n5. **Timmy re-opens his detective agency** (sentence 25): This event signifies Timmy's recovery and his return to pursuing his passions, with the support of his mother.\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **Event 1 (Failure-Mobile stolen)**: Timmy is in a state of loss and curiosity, setting him on a path of investigation. His condition is somewhat neutral, as he is used to dealing with challenges through his detective work.\n2. **Event 2 (Sneaking into the bank)**: Timmy's state is one of determination and possibly overconfidence. He believes he is on the right track to solving the mystery, which shows an improvement in his proactive condition compared to the initial loss.\n3. **Event 3 (Receiving suspension and shutdown of Total Failure Inc.)**: This marks a significant downfall for Timmy. His condition worsens as he faces consequences for his actions, leading to a low point where he loses his agency and faces his mother's disappointment.\n4. **Event 4 (Letting Total go)**: Timmy is at his lowest, feeling defeated and forced to abandon parts of his life that bring him joy. This event represents a deeper low than the previous one, as he is now surrendering parts of himself.\n5. **Event 5 (Re-opening the detective agency)**: Timmy's condition improves as he is given a second chance by his mother. He is in a state of recovery and renewal, showing an upward trend from his previous low points.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, the arc can be classified by observing the pattern of Timmy's state:\n- Starts in a relatively neutral or positive state (running his detective agency).\n- Faces a challenge (stolen Segway) and actively tries to solve it, showing determination.\n- Experiences a significant downfall (suspension, shutdown of his agency, letting Total go), which represents a low point.\n- Then, recovers and ends in a better state than the lowest point (re-opening his agency), but the story also hints at further adventures and potential downsides (believing Corrina Corrina kidnapped his teacher), suggesting a cycle of fall and recovery.\n\nGiven these observations, the story resembles the **Oedipus** arc, where the protagonist starts high, falls, recovers, and then may face another significant challenge or downfall. However, the precise fit into the Oedipus pattern is nuanced because the story concludes on a note of recovery and potential for further adventure rather than an outright downfall. Yet, considering the overall pattern of fall and recovery, and the potential for future challenges, it aligns closest with the **Oedipus** story arc type among the provided options.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\nThe protagonist of the story is Zoey Miller, a junior at Queens University of Charlotte. Five major events in the story are:\n- Event 1: Zoey meets Zach MacLaren after he accidentally hits her with a soccer ball (sentence 4).\n- Event 2: Zoey spends time with Zach's family, including his cousin Miles, after Zach gets amnesia and mistakes her for his girlfriend (sentences 13-18).\n- Event 3: Zoey discovers Miles is in a polyamorous relationship, leading to disappointment, but she then bonds with Zach (sentences 20-25).\n- Event 4: The real Zoey (Zach's girlfriend) appears, accusing Zoey of identity theft, leading to Zoey leaving the MacLarens' and facing rumors and negative attention at school (sentences 26-30).\n- Event 5: Zoey confesses her feelings to Zach after he has broken up with his girlfriend, and they kiss (sentences 39-40).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n- **Event 1:** Initially, Zoey is portrayed as a confident, intelligent individual who does not believe in traditional romantic love. Her state is one of independence and self-assurance. After meeting Zach, her state slightly changes as she begins to interact with him, but she remains skeptical about romance.\n- **Event 2:** Zoey's state improves as she finds common ground with Miles and begins to enjoy her time with Zach's family. She starts to open up and shows a more vulnerable side, indicating a positive change in her emotional state.\n- **Event 3:** Although initially disappointed by Miles' relationship status, Zoey's state takes a turn for the better as she bonds with Zach over shared activities. This marks a significant positive shift in her emotional state, as she starts to form a connection with Zach.\n- **Event 4:** Zoey's state worsens dramatically as she faces accusations, rumors, and negative attention. She feels deceived, embarrassed, and her self-esteem takes a hit. This event marks a low point in her emotional journey.\n- **Event 5:** After reflecting on her feelings and with the encouragement of her mom, Zoey's state improves as she decides to take a chance and express her feelings to Zach. The positive outcome of this event, with Zach reciprocating her feelings, leaves her in a much better state than at the beginning of the story.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\nThe story arc can be classified based on how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the narrative. Initially, Zoey is in a state of independence and skepticism towards love. She then faces a series of events that challenge her beliefs and emotional state, including positive interactions with Zach and his family, followed by a significant setback when her identity is mistaken and she faces social backlash. However, she recovers from this low point by reflecting on her feelings and taking action, leading to a positive outcome where she confesses her feelings to Zach and they kiss.\n\nThis pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist faces challenges, falls into a difficult situation (or \"hole\"), and then finds a way out, ending in a better condition than where she started. Given the cyclical nature of her challenges and recoveries, particularly the significant drop in her state after the identity theft accusation and her subsequent rise after confessing her feelings, the story fits the \"Double Man in a Hole\" arc. This arc type is characterized by the protagonist experiencing two cycles of falling into a dilemma and then recovering, which aligns with Zoey's experiences of facing setbacks and then overcoming them to achieve a positive outcome.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Joshua, a tenth grader with a unique habit of writing chilling horror stories. Five major events in the story can be identified as follows:\n\n1. **Introduction to Joshua's Life and Habits**: Joshua is introduced, showing his life and his habit of writing horror stories.\n2. **Sharing His Story at School**: Joshua decides to share his latest horror story at the school's show-and-tell session, which leads to his guardians being called in.\n3. **Real-Life Events Mimicking His Story**: A series of uncanny events unfold in the city, mirroring the terrifying events described in Joshua's story, alarming both Joshua and the community.\n4. **Discovery of the Truth Behind \"The Terminus\"**: An investigation uncovers the alarming truth that \"The Terminus\" isn't a product of Joshua's imagination but an ominous messenger of an old witch's curse on the city.\n5. **Heroic Resolution**: Joshua crafts a narrative where \"The Terminus\" is defeated heroically, and unbelievably, the events of his story happen in the city, leading to the arrest of \"The Terminus\" and Joshua being recognized as a hero.\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: Joshua is in a neutral state, living his life with a unique habit that sets him apart but doesn't necessarily put him in a position of advantage or disadvantage.\n- **Event 2**: Joshua's state becomes somewhat negative as his actions lead to concern from his school and guardians, potentially isolating him or making him feel like an outsider.\n- **Event 3**: Joshua's state worsens as he and the community are alarmed by the real-life events mimicking his story, suggesting a loss of control or understanding of his creations' impact.\n- **Event 4**: Joshua's state begins to improve as he discovers the truth behind \"The Terminus,\" giving him a sense of purpose and direction to address the situation.\n- **Event 5**: Joshua's state significantly improves as he successfully resolves the crisis, turning him into a hero and changing his social standing from an outsider to a celebrated individual.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, it can be observed that Joshua starts in a relatively neutral position, faces challenges and setbacks (being seen as an outsider, losing control over his story's impact), and then rises to a higher state by discovering the truth and heroically resolving the crisis. This pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (the negative repercussions of his story and the mysterious events) and then finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning.\n\nThe story arc types provided include \"Rags to Riches,\" \"Riches to Rags,\" \"Man in a Hole,\" \"Icarus,\" \"Double Man in a Hole,\" \"Cinderella,\" and \"Oedipus.\" The description of Joshua's journey fits best with the \"Man in a Hole\" arc, as he faces a dilemma (the events mirroring his story and the subsequent investigation and truth revelation) and then recovers, ending in a better state than where he started (being celebrated as a hero).\n\n### 4.

However, it's also arguable that the protagonist could be considered as President John Harper or even the collective team of Operation Phoenix, given the story's focus on their formation and mission. For the purpose of analysis, let's focus on General Jordan Mathews as the primary protagonist.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. The introduction of the global crisis and General Mathews' proposal to President Harper (sentences 1-7).\n2. President Harper's consideration and authorization of Operation Phoenix (sentences 8-12).\n3. General Mathews' recruitment of unique individuals for the operation (sentences 13-16).\n4. The assembly and showcasing of the team's abilities (sentence 16).\n5. The team's relocation to an underground base for training and operations (sentence 18-19).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n1. **Introduction of the Crisis**: General Mathews is faced with a dire global situation, proposing a radical solution to President Harper. His state is one of urgency and concern.\n2. **Authorization of Operation Phoenix**: With President Harper's approval, Mathews' proposal is validated, and he is tasked with a critical mission. His state improves as he gains the go-ahead for his plan.\n3. **Recruitment**: Mathews is in the process of gathering a team, which is a challenging but hopeful phase. His state is engaged and proactive.\n4. **Assembly and Showcase**: Seeing the team's potential and capabilities, Mathews likely feels a sense of accomplishment and optimism. His state is positive, with a sense of potential success.\n5. **Relocation to the Base**: With the team assembled and relocated, Mathews has successfully initiated the operation. His state is one of readiness and anticipation for the challenges ahead.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the progression of General Mathews' state throughout the story, it starts with a sense of urgency and concern due to the global crisis, which can be considered a low point. As the story progresses and Operation Phoenix is authorized, assembled, and initiated, Mathews' state improves, reflecting a sense of purpose, accomplishment, and hope for resolving the crisis. This improvement from a low point to a higher point, with the protagonist finding a way out of the initial dilemma (the global crisis) by forming and initiating Operation Phoenix, aligns with the **Man in a Hole** story arc type. The protagonist falls into a dilemma (the crisis) and finds a way out (by forming and starting Operation Phoenix), ending in a better state than at the beginning.\n\n### 4.

This pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (or a \"hole\") and then finds a way out, ending in a better state than when he started.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is John Decker, a veteran CIA agent. The five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Introduction to the Case**: John is handed a classified report about Alliance 127, and the case is reopened due to fresh evidence (sentence 3).\n2. **Discovery of Premeditated Hijacking**: John's team yields disconcerting leads suggesting a premeditated hijacking, turning the narrative on its head (sentence 7).\n3. **Personal Tragedy**: Unknown enemies target Sarah with brutal precision, culminating in a shocking personal tragedy - the suspicious car crash that claims her brother Robert's life (sentence 9).\n4. **Infiltration and Evidence Retrieval**: Sarah undertakes a daring mission to infiltrate a base camp operated by the enemy and manages to escape with crucial evidence, although she is fatally wounded in the process (sentences 14-16).\n5. **Resolution and Justice**: John wages a relentless battle against the corrupt officials, and the malicious web behind the Alliance 127 incident unravels, leading to the exoneration of the innocent victims (sentences 18-20).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: John's state is one of intrigue and professional engagement as he delves into the reopened case of Alliance 127. His condition is neutral, as he is simply doing his job.\n- **Event 2**: John's state becomes more engaged and possibly skeptical as the evidence points to a premeditated hijacking. His condition has become more complex, with a deeper investment in uncovering the truth.\n- **Event 3**: This event significantly affects John's team and ally, Sarah, rather than John directly. However, it impacts John's state by increasing his determination and possibly his emotional involvement in the case. His condition has worsened in terms of the risks and challenges he and his team face.\n- **Event 4**: John's state is one of heightened urgency and risk as Sarah's mission and subsequent injury raise the stakes. His condition is critical, as the success of their mission hangs in the balance, and he faces the loss of a key team member.\n- **Event 5**: John's state is one of resolve and vindication as he succeeds in his battle against the corrupt officials and brings about justice for the victims of Alliance 127. His condition has improved significantly, as he has achieved his goals and found a form of closure, albeit at a great cost.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. Initially, John is in a neutral state, professionally engaged. As the story progresses, he faces increasing challenges and risks (worsening condition), including the personal tragedy affecting his team and the high-stakes mission to uncover the truth. Despite these setbacks, John ultimately succeeds in his mission, achieving a better state than at the beginning by bringing justice and transparency (improving condition).\n\nThis pattern fits the **Man in a Hole** story arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (the complexities and dangers of the case) and finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning (achieving justice and closure).\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To classify the story arc type, we first need to identify the protagonist and major events in the story.\n\n1. **Identify the protagonist and 5 major events:**\n   - The protagonist of the story is Lou, an ex-CIA field agent.\n   - Five major events in the story are:\n     1. Lou's initial introduction, where she's living a reclusive life with her dog Jax, dealing with arthritis (sentence 1).\n     2. The moment when Hannah interrupts Lou's suicide attempt, informing her that Vee is missing (sentence 8).\n     3. The revelation that Lou is an ex-CIA field agent and her subsequent actions to track down Philip and rescue Vee (sentence 13).\n     4. The confrontation at the beach where it's revealed that Philip is Lou's son, and she gets injured (sentence 18).\n     5. The final confrontation where Lou fights Philip, apologizes, and then both go under the water's surface as a CIA agent fires on them (sentence 25).\n\n2. **Describe the protagonist's state and how it changed:**\n   - **Event 1:** Lou is in a disadvantaged state, living as a loner and dealing with health issues.\n   - **Event 2:** Lou's state worsens as she's about to commit suicide, indicating a deep emotional or psychological low. However, this event also marks a turning point as she decides to act to help Hannah.\n   - **Event 3:** Lou's state improves significantly as she takes action, using her CIA skills to track down Philip. This shows a recovery and a sense of purpose.\n   - **Event 4:** Lou's state worsens again as she gets injured by her son and faces the consequences of her past actions.\n   - **Event 5:** Lou's final state is one of resolution and acceptance. She apologizes to her son, and her actions lead to a form of redemption, even though it ends in her apparent demise.\n\n3. **Classify the story arc type:**\n   - Given the pattern of Lou's state throughout the story, we see that she starts in a disadvantaged position (loner with health issues), falls into a deeper hole (suicide attempt), then rises as she takes action and uses her skills to help others, faces another downfall (injury and confrontation with her past), and finally ends in a state of resolution and redemption.\n   - This pattern matches the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc type because Lou falls into a dilemma (her initial reclusive state and subsequent suicide attempt) and finds a way out (taking action to help Hannah and confronting her past), ultimately ending in a better state emotionally (having found a form of redemption) than at the beginning, despite the physical outcome.\n\n4. **Determined story arc type:**\nMan in a Hole"

Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1:** Philippa is distraught after losing her promotion and feeling undervalued due to her condition (ME). Her state is low due to professional disappointment and personal frustration.\n- **Event 2:** Philippa's state improves slightly as she becomes engaged with the Richard III Society and begins to pursue her interest in Richard III.

        "output": "To analyze the story arc, let's first identify the protagonist and major events in the story.\n\nThe story revolves around four friends (Sharon, Carol, Vivian, and Diane), but for the purpose of this analysis, we can consider the group as a collective protagonist or focus on the character that undergoes the most significant development. However, since the story is more about their collective journey and less about individual character development, we'll analyze the story based on the group's experiences.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. The friends decide to take a bachelorette trip to Italy (sentence 4).\n2. They fall victim to theft at the train station, losing their luggage, including Diane's urn with her husband's ashes (sentence 8).\n3. They experience a series of adventures and personal connections in Venice, including Sharon meeting Ousmane and Carol reconnecting with Gianni (sentences 12-16).\n4. The group faces legal trouble after a misunderstanding with the police, leading to their brief incarceration (sentence 25).\n5. The friends ultimately make it to Tuscany, where Vivian's wedding takes place, along with an unexpected marriage between Diane and Mitchell (sentences 29-31).\n\nNow, describing the protagonist's (group's) state and how it changes at each event:\n- At event 1, the group is in a state of anticipation and excitement, looking forward to their trip and Vivian's upcoming wedding. Their condition is positive, eager for adventure.\n- By event 2, the group's state worsens as they become victims of theft, losing their belongings and Diane's urn, which contains sentimental value. This is a clear downturn in their condition.\n- At event 3, the group's state improves as they enjoy their time in Venice, forming new connections and experiencing personal growth. This marks a recovery from the previous low point.\n- Event 4 sees the group's state decline again as they face legal issues and are jailed, which is another downturn.\n- Finally, at event 5, the group's state improves significantly as they not only make it to the wedding but also experience additional joy with Diane and Mitchell's marriage. This event marks a higher point than where they started, as they've grown through their experiences and formed deeper bonds.\n\nGiven these observations, the story arc type can be classified based on the pattern of the group's condition throughout the story. The group faces a dilemma (theft), recovers and experiences growth (in Venice), faces another setback (legal trouble), and ultimately ends in a better state than they began (the successful and joyful conclusion of the trip with the weddings).\n\nThe determined story arc type is Double Man in a Hole."

Identify the protagonist and 5 major events in the story\n\nThe protagonists in the story are Aiden Smith and Riley Johnson, who are interconnected in their lives and ambitions. For the purpose of analysis, we'll consider their joint experiences as the protagonist's journey. Here are 5 major events:\n\n1. **The Anniversary Dinner and Grant Rejection** (Sentence 5): Aiden's architectural grant proposal is rejected during their anniversary dinner.\n2. **The Onset of Creative Blocks and Relationship Strains** (Sentences 10-12): Both Aiden and Riley face setbacks in their careers (Aiden's project denial and Riley's creative block), leading to strain in their relationship.\n3. **The Proposal of a Road Trip** (Sentence 13): Riley suggests an extended road trip to find peace and reconcile their relationship.\n4. **The Cross-Country Journey and Its Challenges** (Sentences 15-18): They embark on the road trip, facing various hardships but also experiencing moments of self-discovery and reconnection.\n5. **The Return to New York with Renewed Perspective** (Sentences 25-31): After the trip, they return to New York, with their relationship stronger, and their approaches to life and work renewed.\n\n### 2. Describe the protagonist's state and how it changed relative to the previous events\n\n- **Event 1 (The Anniversary Dinner and Grant Rejection)**: The protagonists are in a state of celebration and happiness, which quickly turns into dismay and disappointment upon receiving the news of the grant rejection. Their state changes from high to low.\n- **Event 2 (The Onset of Creative Blocks and Relationship Strains)**: Following the rejection, both characters face professional setbacks and personal relationship strains, leading to a further decline in their state. The creative blocks and relationship issues deepen their distress.\n- **Event 3 (The Proposal of a Road Trip)**: In an attempt to escape their current woes and reconnect, the proposal of a road trip marks a turning point where they seek a solution to their problems. Their state begins to shift from despair towards hope.\n- **Event 4 (The Cross-Country Journey and Its Challenges)**: During the trip, they face challenges but also experience moments of connection and self-discovery. This journey starts to improve their state as they learn to appreciate each other and themselves in a new light.\n- **Event 5 (The Return to New York with Renewed Perspective)**: Upon returning, they are in a significantly better state than when they left. Their relationship is stronger, and they have a renewed sense of purpose and energy in their careers. Their state has improved from the lowest point.\n\n### 3. Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain your reasoning\n\nGiven the progression of the protagonists' state throughout the story, it starts with a high point (celebrating their anniversary), then declines (facing professional rejections and personal strains), reaches a low point (struggling with relationship issues and creative blocks), and then improves (embarking on a journey of self-discovery and reconciliation) to end on a higher note than where it began (returning with a renewed perspective and stronger relationship). This pattern follows a story arc where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (the low point after the rejection and relationship strain) and then finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning. This is characteristic of the **Man in a Hole** story arc, where the protagonist's condition improves from the first turning point (the rejection) to the last turning point (their return to New York).\n\n### 4.

Poe tells Landor he has two notes with handwriting samples that link Landor directly to the murders, but burns them instead (sentence 27).\n\n### TASK 2: Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n1. **Initial Event**: At the beginning, Landor is in a low state, being an alcoholic and a widower whose daughter has run off. His condition is poor, both physically and emotionally.\n2. **Suspicion of Dr. Marquis' Family**: As Landor delves deeper into the case with Poe, he becomes more engaged and seemingly starts to recover from his alcoholism and personal losses, driven by the investigation. His condition starts to improve as he finds purpose.\n3. **Poe's Discovery**: When Poe is almost killed by Artemus and Lea, Landor rescues him, which could be seen as a peak in his recovery and investigative success. However, this event also marks a turning point where Landor's true nature begins to unravel.\n4. **Revelation of Landor's Guilt**: The revelation that Landor is the killer of the cadets marks a significant downfall. His condition worsens as his dark past and true intentions are exposed, showing that his initial recovery was superficial.\n5. **Final Confrontation with Poe**: After the truth is out, and despite Poe choosing not to turn him in, Landor's emotional state reaches a nadir. He is forced to confront the consequences of his actions and the loss of his daughter. His condition is at its lowest, reflecting on his vengeance and its costs.\n\n### TASK 3: Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, it starts low (due to personal losses and alcoholism), rises as Landor finds purpose in the investigation, peaks when he rescues Poe, and then drastically falls when his true nature and actions are revealed. This pattern matches the **Icarus** story arc, where the protagonist rises to a peak but then faces a significant downfall. Landor's rise is not about achieving success or happiness but about finding a temporary distraction from his pain and a means to exact revenge. His downfall is not just about being caught but also about the emotional and moral implications of his actions being laid bare.\n\n### TASK 4: Determined Story Arc Type\n\nIcarus"

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Quinn Ackerman, a quirky and intelligent high school senior. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. Quinn getting fired from her position as a technical director for the Thunderbirds (sentence 2).\n2. Quinn deciding to mislead the admissions counselor, Veronica Ramirez, about being a dancer on the Thunderbirds (sentence 4).\n3. Quinn starting her own dance team after being rejected by the Thunderbirds and finding a choreographer in Jake Taylor (sentences 9-14).\n4. Quinn confessing everything to her mom and deciding to quit the dance team to focus on her grades (sentence 22).\n5. Quinn rediscovering her passion for dance, reconciling with Jake, and leading her team, TBD, to win the Work It dance competition (sentences 24-29).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1 (Quinn getting fired):** Quinn's state is one of disappointment and loss. She has just been fired from a position she valued, which marks a low point.\n- **Event 2 (Quinn misleading Veronica):** Quinn's state improves slightly as she sees an opportunity to stand out for college admissions, but this action also introduces a risk and moral dilemma, keeping her state somewhat precarious.\n- **Event 3 (Starting her own dance team):** Quinn's state improves significantly. She takes initiative, finds a new passion, and gains confidence, especially after meeting Jake and improving her dancing skills. This marks a turning point towards a more positive state.\n- **Event 4 (Quinn quitting the dance team):** Quinn's state deteriorates. She faces the consequences of her actions (dropping grades, losing her romance with Jake, and betraying her team's trust), which leads to a low point, even lower than the initial firing due to the added personal and relational losses.\n- **Event 5 (Winning the Work It dance competition):** Quinn's state reaches a high point. She overcomes her previous mistakes, reconciles with important people in her life, and achieves success with her dance team, culminating in a victory that also opens up new opportunities for her future.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story follows Quinn through a series of challenges and setbacks, but ultimately, she rises above these to achieve a higher state than where she started. Initially, Quinn faces a low point after being fired and struggling with her college admissions. However, she then experiences a rise as she starts her own dance team and finds success and love. This is followed by a significant setback when she quits the team, hitting a lower point than before. Finally, she recovers, reconciles, and achieves a high point by winning the competition and securing her future.\n\nThis pattern of rising, facing a setback, and ultimately achieving a higher state aligns with the **Cinderella** story arc type. The Cinderella arc is characterized by the protagonist's journey from a lowly state, through challenges and a significant setback, to ultimately achieving a successful and happy ending. Quinn's story mirrors this arc, as she navigates through personal and professional challenges, faces setbacks, but ultimately emerges victorious and in a better position than where she started.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identify the protagonist and 5 major events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is John Smith, a refined and intelligent prisoner. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n- Event 1: John's life as a prisoner in San Quentin State Prison (sentence 1).\n- Event 2: John's arrest under charges of committing multiple heinous murders, which drastically changes his life (sentence 6).\n- Event 3: The discovery of a new murder similar to the ones John was accused of, which introduces doubt about his guilt (sentence 8).\n- Event 4: John and Sarah uncovering the conspiracy involving a prison guard, Mike, and the counterfeit currency trade (sentence 13).\n- Event 5: The final confrontation where John rescues Sarah, gets injured, and later is exonerated and released from prison (sentences 20-25).\n\n### 2. Describe the protagonist's state and changes at each event\n\n- **Event 1**: John is calm and unperturbed in prison, indicating he has found a way to cope with his situation. His state is one of resignation or acceptance.\n- **Event 2**: John's life is dramatically overturned by his arrest, moving from a mundane life to one of severe accusations and imprisonment. His state changes to one of turmoil and injustice.\n- **Event 3**: With the news of another similar murder, John's situation becomes more complex, introducing a glimmer of hope that he might be innocent. His state is one of potential vindication but still trapped.\n- **Event 4**: As John and Sarah uncover the conspiracy, John's innocence becomes more plausible, and he begins to take action towards his freedom. His state shifts towards one of determination and hope.\n- **Event 5**: After the confrontation, John is exonerated and released from prison, marking a significant improvement in his condition from imprisonment to freedom. His state changes to one of relief, gratitude, and new beginnings.\n\n### 3. Classify the story arc type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the story. Initially, John is in a bad situation (prison), then it gets worse (accused of murders), but through his and Sarah's efforts, his situation improves (exonerated and released). This pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist faces significant challenges, hits a low point, and then recovers to an even better state than before.\n\nThe \"Double Man in a Hole\" story arc is characterized by the protagonist facing two cycles of dilemma and recovery. However, in this story, John faces a continuous downward spiral (from arrest to wrongful imprisonment) followed by an upward climb (from potential vindication to actual exoneration and freedom). This doesn't perfectly fit the \"Double Man in a Hole\" pattern, as there's one major downfall followed by a recovery, rather than two distinct cycles of fall and rise.\n\nA more fitting classification would be the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (wrongful imprisonment) and finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning (exonerated, freed, and with a new lease on life).\n\n### 4.

Five major events in the story can be identified as follows:\n\n1. **Event 1: Introduction to John's Life** - John is thriving in New York City as a successful stockbroker.\n2. **Event 2: Forced Move to Smallville** - John is suddenly moved to Smallville, a quaint agricultural hamlet, where he struggles to adjust.\n3. **Event 3: Discovery of the Treasure Map** - John finds an old blueprint that hints at a treasure buried in the nearby Appalachian Range, sparking his interest and giving him a new goal.\n4. **Event 4: Successful Treasure Hunt** - Despite initial skepticism and challenges, John successfully finds the treasure with the help of the mythical guardian, marking a significant achievement.\n5. **Event 5: Integration into Smallville** - John uses his newfound wealth to modernize the farm, earns the respect and acceptance of the townspeople, and finally feels a sense of belonging in Smallville.\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **At Event 1**, John is in a high state, successful and thriving in his career and city life.\n- **At Event 2**, John's state significantly worsens as he is forced out of his comfort zone and struggles to adapt to the new environment, feeling alienated and helpless.\n- **At Event 3**, John's state begins to improve as he finds a new purpose and excitement in the treasure hunt, which starts to overshadow his initial discomfort.\n- **At Event 4**, John's state improves dramatically as he achieves success in his quest, overcoming numerous challenges and gaining a new sense of self-reliance and respect for nature.\n- **At Event 5**, John's state reaches a new high, not just in terms of wealth but also in terms of personal growth, acceptance, and a sense of belonging, which he had lacked in his city life.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, it can be observed that John starts in a high state (successful in New York), falls into a dilemma (struggling in Smallville), and then finds a way out through his adventure, ending in an even better state (successful treasure hunt and integration into Smallville). This pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist's condition improves from the first turning point to the last turning point, after an initial downfall. This does not perfectly fit the \"Rags to Riches\" arc since John starts in a high state, nor does it fit \"Riches to Rags\" or \"Icarus\" since John ends in a better state than he began. The closest match is the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma and then recovers to end up better than at the beginning.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Tork, the eldest member of the tribe. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **The Tribe's Departure**: The tribe, led by Tork, sets forth on a journey inspired by a grand vision (sentence 6).\n2. **Discovery of the Leviathan**: The tribe discovers an enormous, ancient fossil named 'The Leviathan' on their new beachfront home, which initially brings them anxiety (sentence 10).\n3. **Decision to Confront or Flee**: Tork and the tribe are faced with the decision to either confront their fears and the unseen tribe or flee, which marks a turning point in their journey (sentence 21).\n4. **The Battle with the Leviathan**: Tork leads the charge against the monstrous Leviathan, and after an initial victory, the beast retreats into deeper waters (sentences 26-30).\n5. **Achieving Unity and Harmony**: The tribes decide to live in harmony with the Leviathan and with each other, marking a significant step in their survival journey and societal evolution (sentence 34).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (The Tribe's Departure)**: Tork's state is one of leadership and vision. He has inspired his tribe to move towards a new home based on a prophecy, indicating a high level of influence and purpose.\n- **Event 2 (Discovery of the Leviathan)**: Tork's state changes to one of concern and uncertainty. The discovery of the Leviathan introduces a new, unforeseen challenge that tests his leadership and the tribe's resolve.\n- **Event 3 (Decision to Confront or Flee)**: Tork's state is one of resolve and strategic thinking. He must make a crucial decision that will affect the tribe's future, showing his ability to adapt and lead under pressure.\n- **Event 4 (The Battle with the Leviathan)**: Initially, Tork's state is one of courage and determination as he leads the battle. However, when the Leviathan resurfaces, causing panic, his state momentarily shifts to one of uncertainty before he and the tribe realize the beast is not a predator.\n- **Event 5 (Achieving Unity and Harmony)**: Tork's state is one of wisdom and accomplishment. He has led his tribe not only to survive but to thrive and find harmony with their environment and another tribe, achieving a higher level of societal evolution.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, the story arc can be classified by examining the trajectory of Tork's state from the beginning to the end. Tork starts in a position of leadership and vision, faces challenges and uncertainties (such as the discovery of the Leviathan and the decision to confront or flee), and ultimately achieves a higher state of unity, harmony, and societal evolution. This pattern, where the protagonist rises, faces a setback, and then achieves an even higher state, aligns with the **Cinderella** story arc type. In this arc, the protagonist's condition improves significantly from the start to the end, with setbacks serving as catalysts for growth and ultimate success.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story can be considered as both Kate and John, as the narrative focuses on their relationship and individual developments. However, for the purpose of analyzing the story arc, we can consider Kate as the primary protagonist, given her significant character development and the emotional journey she undertakes.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. **Kate's decision to leave her marketing job on Wall Street to support John's new role at Yale University.** (Event related to sentence 8)\n2. **Kate starts feeling the erosion of her confidence due to the solitude and mundanity of domestic chores in their new home.** (Event related to sentence 16)\n3. **Kate takes an audacious leap by applying for an MBA at Yale, marking her reentry into the academic world.** (Event related to sentence 16)\n4. **Kate's meteoric rise in academia, culminating in her being offered the position to head Yale's business department, contrasts with John's growing insecurity.** (Event related to sentences 23-28)\n5. **Kate and John have a heated confrontation, leading them to take a break and reflect on their identities, ambitions, and their fracturing bond.** (Event related to sentence 31)\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **At the first event (Kate's decision to support John),** Kate's state is one of sacrifice and support. She is leaving behind a successful career to support her husband's dreams, indicating a selfless and loving state but also potentially setting herself up for future dissatisfaction or feelings of loss.\n\n2. **At the second event (feeling the erosion of confidence),** Kate's state has changed to one of doubt and insecurity. She is struggling to find meaning and purpose in her new life, away from her professional identity.\n\n3. **At the third event (applying for an MBA),** Kate's state shifts towards empowerment and determination. She is taking proactive steps to redefine her life and find a new sense of purpose, showing a strong and ambitious side.\n\n4. **At the fourth event (meteoric rise in academia),** Kate's state is one of success and recognition. She is thriving in her new academic environment and gaining respect and admiration from her peers, which contrasts with her initial feelings of insecurity and doubt.\n\n5. **At the fifth event (heated confrontation and taking a break),** Kate's state, along with John's, is one of turmoil and introspection. They are both forced to confront the consequences of their actions and the changes in their relationship, marking a low point in their partnership.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the fluctuations in Kate's state throughout the story, from sacrifice and support, through doubt and insecurity, to empowerment and success, and finally to turmoil and introspection before resolution, the story arc does not follow a simple linear progression. Instead, it involves cycles of dilemma and recovery, particularly as both characters face challenges, individually and together, and work towards overcoming them.\n\nThe story initially seems to follow a **Rags to Riches** arc for Kate, as she moves from a state of doubt and insecurity to one of success and recognition. However, the introduction of conflict and the downward spiral in their relationship, followed by a period of reflection and eventual reconciliation, suggests a more complex narrative.\n\nConsidering the dual nature of the protagonists' journeys and the cycles of challenge and recovery they both undergo, the story can be classified under a specific story arc type that accommodates these dynamics.\n\n### 4.

Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. Buck is abducted and shipped to the Yukon (sentence 2).\n2. Buck is sold to Perrault and his partner Francoise for their dog sled (sentence 4).\n3. Buck displaces Spitz as pack leader (sentence 13).\n4. Buck is rescued by Thornton after being mistreated by Hal (sentence 22).\n5. Buck kills Hal and then mates with a white wolf, becoming the pack leader (sentences 37 and 41).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Abduction):** Buck's state changes from being content and safe with his master, Judge Miller, to being in danger and uncertainty. He loses his comfortable life and is subjected to abuse and hardship.\n  \n- **Event 2 (Sold to Perrault):** Buck's state improves slightly as he starts to gain the trust and loyalty of Perrault, Francoise, and the other sled dogs. He finds a new purpose and begins to thrive in his new role.\n\n- **Event 3 (Displaces Spitz):** Buck's state improves further as he becomes the pack leader, earning the respect of the other dogs. This marks a significant rise in his status and confidence.\n\n- **Event 4 (Rescued by Thornton):** Buck's state was previously at a low due to the mistreatment by Hal, but after being rescued by Thornton, it improves dramatically. He experiences care, recovery, and a deepening bond with Thornton.\n\n- **Event 5 (Kills Hal and Becomes Pack Leader):** Buck's state reaches its highest point as he not only avenges his master's death but also fully embracing his wild instincts, mates with a white wolf, and becomes a pack leader. This signifies a complete transformation from a domesticated dog to a wild leader.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the story. Buck starts in a comfortable situation, falls into hardship, rises to become a pack leader, faces another downfall with Hal's mistreatment, and finally rises again to his highest state as a wild pack leader. This pattern of falling into a dilemma, finding a way out, and then facing another challenge before ultimately rising to a better state than at the beginning matches the **Double Man in a Hole** story arc. The protagonist experiences two significant cycles of downfall and recovery, with each recovery leading to a better state than before, culminating in a final state that is superior to the initial one.\n\n### 4.

Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Joey, the 14-year-old brother who is forced into robbery by his older brother Matt to support their dying mother. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. Joey is forced to rob a remote home and they encounter a security guard, leading to the guard falling into an abandoned well (Sentences 1-2).\n2. Joey decides to visit the trapped guard, Hamby (later revealed to be Randy), and provide him with necessities, feeling guilty about leaving him trapped (Sentence 4).\n3. Matt discovers Joey's actions and tries to kill Hamby by dropping a pesticide canister into the well, revealing the depths of Matt's cruelty (Sentence 6).\n4. Joey learns the truth about the man in the well, Randy, and decides to help him escape in exchange for help in punishing Matt (Sentences 11-14).\n5.

Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the story. Given that Joey starts in a disadvantaged situation (being forced into crime), faces various dilemmas and challenges (guilt over leaving the guard, dealing with Matt's cruelty, allying with a fugitive), and ultimately ends in a better state (reconciled with his brother, safe, and having played a part in resolving the conflict), the story follows a specific pattern.\n\nJoey's journey is characterized by a fall into a dilemma (the initial robbery and its consequences) and a subsequent rise as he navigates through the challenges, makes difficult choices, and eventually finds a way out of his troubles, ending in a more positive state than where he started.\n\n### 4.

Initially, she faces the threat of Russ Thorn, overcomes it, but then faces another, even more personal threat from Kay. Each time, she moves from a state of safety or normalcy into danger and then back out to safety or a state of resolution. This pattern of falling into a dilemma (the \"hole\") and then finding a way out, only to face another dilemma and again find a way out, aligns with the **Double Man in a Hole** story arc. The protagonist's condition improves from the first turning point to the last, with significant setbacks in between, which is characteristic of this story arc type.\n\n### 4.
