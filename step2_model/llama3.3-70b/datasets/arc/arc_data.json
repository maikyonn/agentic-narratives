        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is George Lawson, a 70-year-old man with a rich past as an educator. Five major events in the story can be identified as follows:\n\n1. **Discovery of the Book**: George discovers the unusual book \"Rituals of the Omarians\" in an antique bookstore (sentences 3-4).\n2. **Decision to Perform the Ritual**: George decides to perform the Ceremonial Sacrifice ritual outlined in the book, which requires him to gather various items (sentences 6-8).\n3. **Challenges and Encounters**: George faces challenges and meets various characters (Daisy, Porst, Tim, Professor John) who help or hinder his progress in preparing for the ritual (sentences 9-18).\n4. **Performance of the Ritual**: George performs the Ceremonial Sacrifice, which leads to a significant transformation in the town of Milton (sentences 19-22).\n5. **Aftermath and New Beginnings**: The town is transformed, and George's life takes on a new dimension as he reflects on his power to inspire change and discovers a new ritual in the book (sentences 23-30).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Discovery of the Book)**: George is curious and intrigued by the unusual book. His state is one of mild interest and engagement with his weekly routine.\n- **Event 2 (Decision to Perform the Ritual)**: George's state shifts to one of determination and commitment. He is driven to understand and perform the ritual, indicating a proactive and engaged state.\n- **Event 3 (Challenges and Encounters)**: George faces doubts and challenges, which introduce uncertainty and potential setbacks. His state becomes more complex, with moments of excitement and anticipation mixed with creeping doubts.\n- **Event 4 (Performance of the Ritual)**: With renewed confidence, George successfully performs the ritual, leading to a state of accomplishment and pride. The success of the ritual improves his state significantly.\n- **Event 5 (Aftermath and New Beginnings)**: George's state evolves to one of reflection, satisfaction, and anticipation for new adventures. He is in a better state than at the beginning, having found a new sense of purpose and power.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, it can be observed that George starts in a relatively neutral or mild state of curiosity, faces challenges and doubts (a \"hole\" or downturn), and then recovers and improves significantly after the successful performance of the ritual. This pattern, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (the challenges and doubts associated with preparing for and performing the ritual) and then finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning (with a sense of accomplishment, pride, and new beginnings), aligns with the **Man in a Hole** story arc type.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Arthur (Art), as the narrative primarily follows his journey and emotional transformations. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Event 1**: Art and his pregnant wife, Claire, visit his father, Saul, in Brooklyn (sentence 8).\n2. **Event 2**: Art's true intention for the visit is exposed by Heimish, revealing Art's financial struggles and his plan to ask his father to mortgage his house (sentence 26).\n3. **Event 3**: The demon kills Saul, marking a significant turning point in the story (sentence 28).\n4. **Event 4**: Art discovers the truth about Yosille's ritual and the demon Abyzou, understanding the gravity of the situation and the danger to his wife and unborn child (sentences 38-40).\n5. **Event 5**: Art sacrifices himself to trap the demon Abyzou, but ultimately dies after Heimish stabs him with the inscribed knife (sentences 54-58).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: Art's state is one of estrangement from his family and cultural roots, but he is attempting to reconnect, driven by a mix of genuine familial desire and ulterior motives (financial gain). His condition is somewhat stable, albeit with underlying tension.\n- **Event 2**: Art's state deteriorates as his true intentions are revealed, leading to confrontation and possibly damaging his relationship with his wife and father. His financial and personal struggles become more pronounced.\n- **Event 3**: With Saul's death, Art's state worsens significantly. He not only faces the loss of a family member but also the weight of his failed attempt to reconcile and seek help. The supernatural events start to escalate, further complicating his life.\n- **Event 4**: Art's understanding of the supernatural threat deepens, and he becomes determined to save his wife and child. While his situation is dire, his resolve strengthens, marking a moment of character growth amidst the chaos.\n- **Event 5**: Ultimately, Art's state culminates in sacrifice and death. Despite his bravery and the selfless act of saving his loved ones, his condition ends in tragedy, with him failing to survive the ritual to trap the demon.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the progression of Art's state throughout the story, it's clear that he starts in a somewhat stable but troubled condition, faces significant setbacks and challenges, and ultimately meets a tragic end. His condition worsens over time, especially after the first turning point, where his true intentions are exposed and the supernatural events begin to escalate. This pattern fits the **Riches to Rags** story arc, where the protagonist starts in a relatively high state (or at least with hopes and plans for improvement) but ends in a significantly lower state. Art's journey from attempting to reconnect with his family and solve his financial problems to sacrificing himself to save his loved ones from a demon marks a downward trajectory in his condition.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Arthur Ascender. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Discovery of the Weathered Manuscript**: Arthur finds a manuscript about the Serenity Orb, sparking his adventure (Sentence 5).\n2. **Formation of the Troika**: Arthur, John, and Lucy form a group to find the Serenity Orb, marking a significant step towards their goal (Sentence 17).\n3. **Reaching the Summit of Mt. Solitaire**: The group reaches the summit, only to find it devoid of the Serenity Orb, leading to a moment of dejection (Sentence 22).\n4. **Discovery of the Serenity Orb**: After deciphering a clue, the group finds the Serenity Orb in the Whispering Depths, achieving a major triumph (Sentence 31).\n5. **Saving Dovecliff and John**: The group uses the Orb to heal the village and, in a miraculous turn, saves John's life, culminating in a happy ending (Sentences 35-38).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Discovery of the Manuscript)**: Arthur is fascinated and intrigued, marking the beginning of his journey. His state is one of curiosity and ambition.\n- **Event 2 (Formation of the Troika)**: Arthur's determination and hope are heightened as he gathers a team to aid in his quest. His state improves as he gains support and companions.\n- **Event 3 (Reaching the Summit of Mt. Solitaire)**: Arthur faces disappointment and a setback as the summit does not yield the Serenity Orb. His state worsens temporarily as his dreams seem unattainable.\n- **Event 4 (Discovery of the Serenity Orb)**: Arthur experiences a significant improvement in his state as he achieves his goal, finding the Orb. This event marks a peak in his journey.\n- **Event 5 (Saving Dovecliff and John)**: Arthur's state reaches its highest point as he not only saves his village but also his mentor and friend, John. This event solidifies his growth and success.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the story. Initially, Arthur is in a state of wonder and curiosity, which can be considered a low point in terms of action and achievement. As the story progresses, he faces challenges and setbacks (e.g., the disappointment at the summit), but ultimately, he achieves his goals and finds personal growth and success. This pattern of rising to a challenge, facing a setback, and then ultimately achieving a higher state than where he started aligns with the **Cinderella** story arc type. The Cinderella arc is characterized by the protagonist's rise, a temporary fall or setback, and then a final rise to a higher state than before, which matches Arthur's journey from an ambitious youth to a hero who saves his village.\n\n### 4.

Elmer and Boris discover that Boris cannot fly due to a broken wing and that the island is sinking (sentence 11).\n5. Elmer helps Boris find the courage to jump into the summit's fire, restoring the roots and saving the island (sentence 23).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: Elmer's state is one of loss and disadvantage. He and his mother have lost their business and are moving to a new, unfamiliar place. This is a low point for Elmer, marking the beginning of his journey.\n- **Event 2**: Elmer's state changes to one of hope and possibility. Meeting the talking cat and learning about the dragon offers him a potential solution to his problems, improving his condition from the previous low point.\n- **Event 3**: Elmer's state improves further as he frees Boris and they agree to work together. This marks a significant turning point where Elmer gains an ally and a potential means to achieve his goals, indicating an upward trend in his condition.\n- **Event 4**: Elmer's state becomes challenging again as he faces new obstacles with Boris's limitations and the island's impending doom. This introduces a setback, temporarily halting the upward trend in his condition.\n- **Event 5**: Elmer's state reaches a high point as he successfully helps Boris save the island. This not only solves the immediate problem but also leads to Elmer achieving his initial goal of getting help, thereby improving his condition significantly from the start of the story.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the pattern of Elmer's condition throughout the story, it starts low (loss of the candy shop), rises (meeting the cat and freeing Boris), faces a setback (discovering Boris's limitations and the island's danger), and ultimately achieves a higher state (saving the island and improving his life). This pattern follows the **Cinderella** story arc, where the protagonist rises, faces a setback, and ultimately achieves a higher state. The initial disadvantage, the series of events that offer hope and improvement, the temporary setback, and the final achievement all align with the characteristics of the Cinderella story arc.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Jane Doe, an immensely dedicated critical care nurse who is secretly struggling with chronic and debilitating heart disease.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. Jane's discovery of a hushed conversation between two hospital administrators (sentence 6), which introduces uncertainty into her life.\n2. Jane suffers a sudden onset cardiac crisis (sentence 10), highlighting the severity of her health condition.\n3. The retired attorney offers to help Jane, providing her with legal aid and friendship (sentence 13), which marks a turning point in her struggle against the hospital.\n4. Jane is wrongfully terminated from her job (sentence 20), leading to a significant low point in her life.\n5. The judgment in the lawsuit against the city hospital is announced, finding the hospital guilty of blatant health discrimination (sentence 25), which is a peak moment in Jane's fight for justice.\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **Event 1 (Discovery of Conversation):** Jane's state changes from one of fragile equilibrium to uncertainty and fear. This event introduces a dilemma into her life, making her state worse than before.\n2. **Event 2 (Cardiac Crisis):** Jane's state deteriorates further as her health condition is exacerbated, showing how her physical health is failing, making her condition worse.\n3. **Event 3 (Offer of Help):** With the offer of legal aid and friendship from the retired attorney, Jane's state improves slightly as she gains support and a means to fight back against the hospital, indicating a potential for recovery.\n4. **Event 4 (Wrongful Termination):** Jane's state hits a low point as she loses her job, which is not only a financial blow but also a significant emotional and professional setback, making her condition worse again.\n5. **Event 5 (Judgment in Lawsuit):** Although this event marks a victory for Jane in her legal battle, her health has markedly declined (as mentioned later in the story), indicating that while her legal and social standing might have improved, her physical condition has worsened.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nTo classify the story arc, we need to analyze the pattern of the protagonist's condition throughout the story. The story starts with Jane in a difficult situation, struggling with her health and hiding it from her colleagues. She then faces a series of challenges (discovery of the conversation, cardiac crisis) that worsen her state before receiving help from the retired attorney, which slightly improves her situation. However, she then faces another significant setback (wrongful termination) before achieving a legal victory. Despite this victory, her health declines, leading to her death.\n\nGiven this pattern, the story does not follow a straightforward \"Rags to Riches,\" \"Riches to Rags,\" \"Man in a Hole,\" \"Icarus,\" or \"Cinderella\" arc. Instead, Jane faces multiple cycles of downturns and slight recoveries, with her condition overall trending downward due to her health, despite her legal successes. This pattern resembles the \"Double Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist faces two cycles of dilemma and recovery, but with an ultimate decline in the protagonist's physical condition despite achieving some form of victory or resolution.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Amy Loughren, a single mother and nurse suffering from cardiomyopathy. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Event 1: Introduction to Amy's Condition** (Sentence 1) - Amy is introduced as a single mother and nurse with cardiomyopathy, fearing dismissal from her job due to her health condition.\n2. **Event 2: Discovery of Insulin Administration** (Sentence 9) - Amy notices that insulin had been administered to a non-diabetic patient, Ana Martinez, which sparks her suspicion.\n3. **Event 3: Collapse and Discovery of Contaminated IV Bags** (Sentences 16-17) - Amy discovers holes in several IV bags, indicating contamination, and then collapses due to her health condition.\n4. **Event 4: Confrontation with Charlie** (Sentence 21) - Amy arranges a meeting with Charlie, which leads to his aggressive reaction and eventual arrest.\n5. **Event 5: Resolution and Recovery** (Sentences 26-27) - Charlie confesses to his crimes, and Amy undergoes the heart surgery she needed, improving her health condition significantly.\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **At Event 1**, Amy's state is one of secrecy and fear due to her health condition, which could lead to her dismissal from the hospital.\n- **At Event 2**, Amy's state changes to one of suspicion and investigation. She begins to uncover potential wrongdoing by Charlie, which puts her in a position of risk but also of potential empowerment through knowledge.\n- **At Event 3**, Amy's physical condition worsens as she collapses, but her determination and involvement in uncovering the truth about Charlie increase. This is a critical point where her health and her investigative efforts intersect.\n- **At Event 4**, Amy's state is one of confrontation and risk. She faces Charlie, which leads to his arrest, marking a significant point in resolving the mystery and danger posed by Charlie.\n- **At Event 5**, Amy's state improves dramatically. She has undergone surgery, and the criminal (Charlie) has been brought to justice. Her health condition is addressed, and she achieves a better life situation, as indicated by her living in Florida with her daughters and grandchildren.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the progression of Amy's state throughout the story, it starts with her in a vulnerable position due to her health and job insecurity. As the story unfolds, she faces challenges and dangers, particularly as she gets closer to the truth about Charlie's actions. However, she ultimately emerges in a better state, having solved the mystery, ensured justice is served, and improved her health condition. This pattern, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (health issues and suspicion of a serial killer at her workplace) and then finds a way out, ending in a better condition than at the beginning, aligns with the **Man in a Hole** story arc. The key characteristic of this arc is the protagonist's journey from a low point, through challenges, to a higher point at the end, which is evident in Amy's transformation from a fearful, sick single mother to a healthier, more empowered individual who has contributed to bringing a serial killer to justice.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Rosa, a brave and hopeful individual from El Salvador seeking asylum in the United States. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Rosa's Arrival in New York City**: Rosa disembarks from her flight, full of hope for a new life.\n2. **Rosa Becoming the Target of 'Los Cazadores'**: Rosa's peaceful existence is shattered when she becomes the target of a fearsome gang.\n3. **Rosa's Refusal of Marquez's Proposition**: Rosa denies Marquez's offer to assist with his illegal drug trafficking operations, valuing her freedom.\n4. **Rosa's Escape and Alliance with Antonio**: Rosa escapes from her captors and forms an alliance with Antonio to topple Marquez.\n5. **The Arrest of Marquez and Rosa's New Life**: Marquez is arrested, his criminal empire dismantled, and Rosa's asylum status is granted.\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Rosa's Arrival)**: Rosa is hopeful and determined, looking forward to building a new life in the United States. Her state is positive, full of anticipation for a better future.\n- **Event 2 (Target of 'Los Cazadores')**: Rosa's state changes to one of fear and vulnerability. Her peaceful existence is disrupted, and she is threatened by the gang.\n- **Event 3 (Refusal of Marquez's Proposition)**: Despite being in a dangerous situation, Rosa's decision to refuse Marquez shows courage and a strong will to maintain her freedom. Her state is one of determination, albeit in a precarious situation.\n- **Event 4 (Escape and Alliance)**: Rosa's state improves as she escapes and finds allies. She moves from being a victim to becoming part of a solution, working towards taking down Marquez. This shows a shift towards empowerment and hope.\n- **Event 5 (Arrest of Marquez and New Life)**: Rosa's state at the end is one of triumph, peace, and security. She has overcome her challenges, and her asylum status is granted, securing her a permanent place in the country.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on Rosa's condition throughout the story, it can be observed that she starts in a hopeful state, faces significant setbacks (becoming a target and being threatened), makes courageous decisions (refusing Marquez's proposition), and then works towards and achieves a better state (escaping, forming alliances, and ultimately seeing Marquez arrested and gaining asylum). This pattern follows a rise, a setback, and then an ultimate achievement of a higher state than where she started.\n\n### 4. Determined Story Arc Type\n\nCinderella"

        "output": "### 1. Identify the protagonist and 5 major events in the story\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Berta, a Honduran refugee. Here are 5 major events in the story:\n\n1. Berta is about to be raped by the Los Angeles street gang that kidnapped her. (Sentence 1)\n2. Berta is rescued by her brothers Oscar and Emilio, but Oscar is shot. (Sentences 2-3)\n3. Berta finds temporary safety with John Henry, who takes her in despite his father's objections. (Sentences 4-6)\n4. Hell, the leader of the gang, discovers Berta's location and sends assassins to kill everyone in the house, leading to the death of BJ and Emilio. (Sentences 14-15)\n5. John rescues Berta from Hell's clutches, and Hell is ultimately killed. (Sentences 19-27)\n\n### 2. Describe the protagonist's state and how it changed relative to the previous events\n\nAt event 1, Berta is in a desperate and dangerous situation, about to be raped by the gang.\n\nAt event 2, Berta's state improves slightly as she is rescued by her brothers, but the injury to Oscar introduces a new worry and uncertainty.\n\nAt event 3, Berta finds temporary safety with John, which improves her state further. She is now in a relatively safe environment, although her long-term security is still uncertain.\n\nAt event 4, Berta's state worsens dramatically as Hell discovers her location and sends assassins to kill her and those protecting her. This leads to the death of her protectors and puts her back in grave danger.\n\nAt event 5, Berta's state improves significantly as John rescues her from Hell's clutches, and Hell is ultimately killed. This resolves the main conflict and provides Berta with a sense of safety and closure.\n\n### 3. Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain the reasoning\n\nThe story arc of Berta's journey can be classified based on how her condition changes throughout the story. Initially, Berta is in a very low state, facing imminent danger. She then experiences a series of ups and downs: she is rescued, finds temporary safety, faces danger again, and finally is rescued once more and finds lasting safety. This pattern of rising, facing a setback, and ultimately achieving a higher state is characteristic of the Cinderella story arc. Berta starts in a disadvantaged position, faces challenges and setbacks, but ultimately ends up in a better situation due to the actions of John and the defeat of Hell.\n\n### 4.

Describe the protagonist's state at each event and how it changed relative to the previous events.\n\n1. **At Lily's adoption (Event 1)**: Lily's state changes from being alone and abandoned to being part of a loving family. Her condition improves significantly as she transitions from an uncertain, potentially bleak future to one filled with love and opportunity.\n2. **At Lily's friendship with Tyson (Event 2)**: Lily's state evolves as she finds a friend who shares her ethnicity and struggles, offering her a sense of belonging and connection to her roots. Her condition improves further as she experiences less isolation.\n3. **At the discovery of the Mid-Autumn festival (Event 3)**: Lily becomes more curious and enthusiastic about her Chinese heritage. Her state indicates a growing sense of identity and purpose, as she starts to explore her cultural roots more actively.\n4. **At Lily's decision to learn Mandarin and contemplate finding her birth parents (Event 4)**: Lily's state becomes more complex, with a mix of excitement about learning more about her heritage and potential anxiety or conflict about her identity and family relationships. While her desire for self-discovery deepens, her emotional state might be seen as more turbulent due to the potential strain on her relationships.\n5. **At hosting the Mid-Autumn festival in Green Valley (Event 5)**: Lily's state reflects a sense of accomplishment, pride, and peace. She has found a way to connect with her heritage that also enriches her community, leading to a deeper sense of belonging and acceptance within her family and town. Her condition has improved significantly from the beginning, as she has moved from being an isolated, culturally disconnected individual to a confident, culturally connected member of her community.\n\n### 3. Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain your reasoning.\n\nThe story arc of Lily's journey can be classified based on how her condition changes throughout the narrative. Initially, Lily is in a disadvantaged situation (abandoned), which improves significantly upon her adoption. As the story progresses, she faces dilemmas related to her identity and cultural heritage, but ultimately, these challenges lead to a deeper understanding of herself and her place within her family and community.\n\nGiven that Lily starts in a disadvantaged situation and ends in a much better one, with her condition improving from the first turning point to the last, the story fits the **Rags to Riches** arc. This classification is appropriate because Lily's journey is marked by an overall improvement in her life situation, from abandonment to finding a loving family, and from cultural isolation to a profound connection with her heritage and community.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\n\nThe protagonist in the story is Carlos, a highly regarded artist. The 5 major events in the story can be identified as follows:\n\n1. **Initial Success and Inner Turmoil**: Carlos is celebrated for his abstract impressionistic paintings at a prestigious New York City art exhibit, but behind the scenes, he struggles with the pressure of his success and turns to ecstasy and bourbon for solace (sentences 1-5).\n2. **Introduction to Art Therapy**: Carlos meets Alejandra, an art therapist, at the Guggenheim annual art gala, where she recognizes the anguish in his work and offers him art therapy (sentences 8-14).\n3. **Engagement with Art Therapy**: Carlos begins to engage with art therapy under Alejandra's guidance, which helps him to confront his past and start his journey towards recovery (sentences 15-19).\n4. **Setback and Overdose**: Despite his progress, Carlos succumbs to his addiction and suffers an ecstasy overdose, landing him in the hospital (sentences 20-23).\n5. **Recovery and Transformation**: After his near-death experience, Carlos seeks help through Narcotics Anonymous, continues with art therapy, and eventually transforms his life, finding solace in his art and a path to recovery (sentences 24-35).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Carlos is at the peak of his success but internally struggling, indicating a state of external glory and internal despair.\n- **Event 2**: The introduction of Alejandra and art therapy marks a turning point where Carlos begins to acknowledge his need for help, showing a slight improvement in his willingness to address his issues.\n- **Event 3**: Engagement with art therapy signifies a more profound improvement as Carlos starts to confront his past and work towards recovery, marking a significant positive change in his state.\n- **Event 4**: The setback of succumbing to his addiction and the subsequent overdose represents a drastic decline in Carlos's state, indicating a moment of extreme vulnerability and darkness.\n- **Event 5**: The final event showcases Carlos's recovery and transformation, where he not only overcomes his addiction but also finds a new sense of purpose and strength through his art and therapy, culminating in a higher state of well-being than where he started.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the progression of Carlos's state throughout the story, it's clear that he experiences a rise (initial success), a fall (internal struggle and addiction), a further fall (overdose), and then a rise again (recovery and transformation). This pattern does not fit the \"Rags to Riches\" or \"Riches to Rags\" story arcs because Carlos's journey involves both a decline from a high point and a subsequent recovery to an even higher point. It doesn't fit the \"Man in a Hole\" or \"Icarus\" story arcs perfectly either because Carlos's story involves a significant setback after a period of recovery, which is more characteristic of story arcs that involve multiple cycles of decline and recovery.\n\nThe story arc that best fits Carlos's journey is the \"Cinderella\" type, which involves a protagonist who rises, faces a setback, and ultimately achieves a higher state. However, upon closer examination, Carlos's story more accurately reflects a pattern of facing significant challenges, recovering, facing another challenge, and then achieving a higher state of being. This nuanced progression suggests that while the \"Cinderella\" classification provided might seem fitting due to the overall trajectory from a low point to a higher point, the specific details of Carlos's journey—especially the cycle of recovery, setback, and final recovery—might align more closely with a \"Double Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist faces two cycles of dilemma and recovery.\n\nHowever, considering the provided classification and the typical characteristics of each story arc, the narrative provided for Carlos aligns closely with the \"Cinderella\" story arc due to the overall trajectory of his journey, from a state of despair and addiction, through a process of recovery, to ultimately achieving a higher state of well-being and success.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Sebastián Silva, a depressed, ketamine-addicted artist and filmmaker. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. Sebastián meets Jordan Firstman at a gay nude beach after nearly drowning.\n2. Jordan posts a video of Sebastián snorting ketamine on social media without his permission, leading to a confrontation.\n3. Sebastián agrees to work with Jordan on his television project after mentioning it to HBO executives.\n4. Sebastián falls to his death from the rooftop while moving a couch for Jordan.\n5. The truth about Sebastián's death is slowly uncovered, with Vero eventually confessing her role in covering it up.\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Sebastián is in a vulnerable state, having nearly drowned and being a depressed, ketamine-addicted individual. His condition is precarious, and this event sets the stage for his interactions with Jordan.\n- **Event 2**: Sebastián's state worsens as he is publicly embarrassed by Jordan's actions, highlighting his addiction and potentially damaging his professional reputation. This event shows a decline in Sebastián's condition due to external factors beyond his control.\n- **Event 3**: Despite the previous setback, Sebastián sees an opportunity in working with Jordan and potentially reviving his career. This could be seen as a slight improvement in his state, as he is taking action towards a positive change.\n- **Event 4**: Sebastián's death marks the ultimate low point in his condition. It's a tragic end to his struggles with addiction and depression, exacerbated by the circumstances of his accident.\n- **Event 5**: While Sebastián is deceased by this point, the uncovering of the truth about his death and the circumstances surrounding it can be seen as a form of resolution or closure for the characters involved, particularly Vero and Sebastián's brother, Juan. However, for Sebastián himself, his condition cannot change as he is deceased.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the progression of Sebastián's condition throughout the story, it starts at a low point with Sebastián being depressed and addicted, sees a brief potential for improvement when he considers working with Jordan, but ultimately ends in tragedy with his death. This pattern does not fit the typical \"Rags to Riches\" or \"Cinderella\" story arcs, which require an overall improvement in the protagonist's condition by the end. It also doesn't fit \"Man in a Hole\" or \"Double Man in a Hole,\" as Sebastián does not recover from his dilemmas in a way that improves his condition by the story's conclusion. The \"Icarus\" story arc, which involves a rise followed by a drastic fall, might seem applicable, but Sebastián's condition at the beginning is already quite low, and while there's a brief potential for rise, it's not a significant enough climb to warrant this classification. The \"Oedipus\" story arc, involving a fall, recovery, and then another significant downfall, also doesn't apply because Sebastián's story lacks a significant recovery phase before his final downfall.\n\nThe \"Riches to Rags\" classification provided seems incorrect based on the typical definition of this story arc, which involves a protagonist starting in a high status and ending in a lower one. Sebastián starts in a low state and ends in an even lower state (death), which doesn't align with the traditional \"Riches to Rags\" narrative.\n\n### 4. Determined Story Arc Type\n\nRiches to Rags"

a 12-year-old boy.\n3) We observe Billy engrossed in timeless childhood pleasures - playing fetch with his faithful Golden Retriever named Daisy, pedaling his bicycle along narrowing streets framed by towering maple trees, and spending quiet afternoons fishing by the gentle stream, his laughter rippling through the air blending with the trickling sound of water.\n4) One sparkling Saturday, a lively block party brings the usually calm Elm Street alive with eager activity.\n5) Enticed by the infectious joviality, Billy attends the party, his big round eyes wide with wonder.\n6) Amid the smoky barbecue scent and loud laughter echoing through the air, he finds himself captivated by Melissa Meyer.\n7) His gaze fixates on the gracefully elegant woman in her late twenties from the moment he sets his eyes on her.\n8) The charisma she exudes due to her city-bred confidence engulfs Billy in an unprecedented whirlpool of feelings.\n9) Being a sophisticated attorney straight from the bustling city of New York, Melissa adorns the quiet suburban block with a cosmopolitan aura that naturally magnetizes the naive Billy towards her.\n10) Overwhelmed by this alien sensation, Billy dares to approach her.\n11) He offers Melissa a marriage proposal - spontaneous and innocent.\n12) Melissa, taken by surprise, bursts into laughter and gently declines his proposal.\n13) This gentle refusal punches Billy's heart like a crushing blow.\n14) Rejection washes over his innocence, and he flees from the laughter-filled party, abandoning the utopia he has held so dear.\n15) Desperate for understanding, Billy confides in his older brother, John - a charismatic artist famed for his charm with women.\n16) John, as a responsible elder brother, takes it upon himself to tutor Billy.\n17) His unique curriculum centers around the art of dealing with older women with finesse and grace.\n18) Even as Billy follows his brother's advice diligently, we see Melissa battling her stressful city life.\n19) Her demanding corporate lawyer job, the emotional turmoil of a painful break-up, and the society-inflicted apprehension of nearing thirty hold her captive in constant stress.\n20) On his mission to win Melissa's heart, Billy unknowingly becomes a regular visitor to her life.\n21) His innocent antics offer her a comic respite from her cookie-cutter life, lifting her spirits in an unexpectedly delightful way.\n22) Billy's persona, under the guiding hand of John, starts undergoing changes.\n23) Observing these gradual changes in Billy, Melissa finds herself amused.\n24) As the relationship between Billy and Melissa burgeons, a protective instinct awakens in her.\n25) She looks at him fondly, more like an elder sister rather than a romantic interest, desperately wishing to preserve his innocence against the harsh light of heartbreak.\n26) Billy, blinded by his so-called love, misunderstands her protectiveness as romantic feelings and proposes to Melissa again.\n27) This time around, the rejection hits Billy harder.\n28) He hangs on the event's edges, left alone to grapple with his deeper heartache.\n29) A dejected Billy distances himself from Melissa, retreating into isolation to mend his bruised heart.\n30) His departure leaves Melissa facing an unexpected void, which she hadn't anticipated.\n31) Reflecting on their interaction, Melissa decides to mend her relationship with Billy.\n32) She offers him a crystal-clear explanation of their life's significant disparities and suggests they should be friends.\n33) Freshly hurt Billy dismisses her olive branch immediately.\n34) In his absence, Melissa gets an insight into Billy's simplistic view of life.\n35) As the pain of his unrequited love eases with time, Billy embarks on a journey of self-awareness.\n36) He realizes his infatuation for Melissa was merely a stepping stone into his adolescence.\n37) Embracing this newfound wisdom, he accepts Melissa's offer of friendship.\n38) His acceptance comes from a place of maturity, not as a consolation prize for his lost love.\n39) As our story gradually unfolds, we find Billy and Melissa at another lively neighborhood party on Elm Street.\n40) Only this time, they appear as friends, no longer hostage to Billy's romantic pursuit.\n41) They share a dance, a casual two-step - a symbol of their friendship.\n42) Their dance subtly hints at a bond beyond societal expectations and norms, a testament to their mutual respect and adoration.\n43) Throughout the story, we witness Billy navigating through the maze of love, overcoming the agony of rejection, progressing from the cocooned world of boyhood to the complex world of adolescence.\n44) In contrast, Melissa manages to rekindle her connection with the youthful innocence she had misplaced amidst her adult responsibilities.\n45) She learns to ease her overbearing adult consciousness and starts discovering joy in the simple things in life.\n46) Our story thus revolves around an unexpected friendship that smudges the distinctive lines of societal norms, a narrative where age and maturity become blurred lines of reference.\n47) It outlines a refreshing side of first love, imbued with the melodrama of adolescence, the poignant reality of unrequited love, and the sweet simplicity of friendship.\n48) This story inquires into a young boy's hurried plot to steer towards adulthood while tracing a woman's journey of unlearning her engrossed adult seriousness to embrace the carefree joys of youth.\n49) As the plot unfolds, both characters become surfaces of emotional evolution - their parallel journeys generating lessons of self-discovery, love, and the myriad layers of maturity.\n50) Billy's transformation from being a naive boy to a well-rounded young man capable of treading life's intricacies forms a compelling arc within the tale.\n51) Equally engaging is Melissa's transformation from an overburdened adult to a woman who finds solace and happiness in Billy's uncomplicated world.\n52) The lives of these two characters, though separate, cross several times, weaving a fulfilling narrative tapestry full of drama, humor, and emotional growth.\n53) The conclusion beautifully encapsulates their enduring friendship and personal growth, symbolized by a harmonious dance between Billy and Melissa.\n54) Titled \"Connecticut Crush: Smooth Moves, Tough Age,\", the movie weaves an emotionally resonant narrative.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better (e.g., 0→1→2→4→10)\n- Riches to Rags: Protagonist starts high and ends lower (e.g., 10→9→8→6→0)\n- Man in a Hole: Protagonist falls into trouble but recovers (e.g., 6→2→1→4→10)\n- Icarus: Protagonist rises then falls dramatically (e.g., 2→4→9→5→1)\n- Double Man in a Hole: Two cycles of fall and recovery (e.g., 6→2→7→4→10)\n- Cinderella: Rise, setback, ultimate triumph (e.g., 1→7→4→1→10)\n- Oedipus: Start high, fall, recover, final fall (e.g., 10→4→7→9→1)",

Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **At Event 1**, Billy is in a state of innocence and happiness, enjoying his childhood.\n- **At Event 2**, Billy's state changes to one of infatuation and then heartbreak after being rejected by Melissa. His condition worsens from happiness to sadness.\n- **At Event 3**, Billy is determined to change and improve himself, indicating a transition from a state of heartbreak towards self-improvement. His condition starts to improve as he learns and grows.\n- **At Event 4**, despite his growth, Billy faces another setback with the second rejection. His condition temporarily worsens again as he faces deeper heartache.\n- **At Event 5**, Billy's condition improves significantly as he accepts Melissa's friendship offer, marking a transition from unrequited love to a mature understanding and friendship. He ends in a better state than at the beginning, having gained maturity and a meaningful relationship.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, it can be observed that Billy faces two major cycles of dilemma and recovery:\n\n1. The first cycle starts with Billy's happy and innocent state, followed by his infatuation and rejection by Melissa (dilemma), and then his decision to learn and improve himself (recovery).\n2. The second cycle involves Billy's second proposal and rejection (another dilemma), leading to his eventual acceptance and maturity in accepting Melissa's friendship (another recovery).\n\nThis pattern of facing a problem, attempting to overcome it, facing another problem, and finally overcoming it to end in a better state aligns with the **Double Man in a Hole** story arc. In this arc, the protagonist experiences two significant falls (into \"holes\") but manages to recover and end up in a better condition than at the start.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Andrew, a twelve-year-old New Jersey resident at the beginning who grows into a young adult throughout the narrative. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. Andrew is rejected by a party host due to their age difference (sentence 1).\n2. Andrew meets Domino and her autistic daughter, Lola, at a bat mitzvah and begins to form a connection with them (sentences 4-6).\n3. Andrew is hired as Lola's sitter and starts developing feelings for Domino, despite her being engaged (sentences 14-15).\n4. Andrew confesses his love to Domino, but she rejects him, stating she is in love with her fiancé, Joseph (sentence 28).\n5. Andrew decides not to go to Barcelona and instead plans to move out, marking a significant change in his life direction (sentences 31-33).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State and Change at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: Andrew starts in a state of rejection and possibly low self-esteem due to the age difference being the reason for rejection. This sets a baseline of him being in a somewhat disadvantaged or vulnerable position.\n- **Event 2**: Andrew's state improves as he finds success and appreciation in his role at the bat mitzvah, meeting Domino and Lola, and starting to form meaningful connections. This marks an upward turn in his condition.\n- **Event 3**: Andrew's state continues to improve as he deepens his connection with Domino and Lola, finding employment as a sitter, and potentially seeing a romantic future with Domino. This represents a peak in his condition, with both personal and emotional fulfillment on the horizon.\n- **Event 4**: Andrew's state takes a significant downturn as he faces rejection from Domino, who chooses her engagement over the feelings she might have for him. This rejection, combined with the loss of his job as Lola's sitter, marks a low point in his condition.\n- **Event 5**: Andrew's state begins to recover as he decides to move on from the rejection and the idea of reuniting with Maya. He plans to move out and start anew, indicating a readiness to leave past disappointments behind and look forward to personal growth and independence. While not as high as his peak, this marks a step towards recovery and a new beginning.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the analysis, Andrew's story follows an **Icarus** arc. The Icarus story arc is characterized by the protagonist starting in a low state, rising to a peak, and then falling to a low point again. In Andrew's case:\n- He starts low (rejected at a young age, and then later facing a long-distance relationship with Maya).\n- He rises as he finds success and connection with Domino and Lola.\n- He peaks when he confesses his feelings to Domino, representing the highest point of his emotional investment and potential for happiness.\n- He falls when Domino rejects him and he loses his role as Lola's sitter, marking a significant downturn.\n- He ends in a state of recovery and newfound independence, deciding to move on and start anew, though this final state is more about acceptance and moving forward rather than returning to a previous high.\n\nThis pattern aligns with the Icarus arc, where the protagonist experiences a dramatic rise followed by a fall, and then concludes in a state that reflects a degree of recovery or acceptance of their circumstances.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Eileen Dunlop, a young woman working in a corrections facility for teenage boys. Five major events in the story can be identified as follows:\n\n1. Eileen meets Rebecca Saint John, a new psychologist at the prison, and is drawn to her intellectual conversation and glamorous appearance (sentence 5-6).\n2. Rebecca invites Eileen to a local bar, and after a night of drinking and dancing, Rebecca kisses Eileen (sentence 9-10).\n3. Eileen learns that Rebecca has left for the Christmas holiday, but then receives a call from Rebecca inviting her to her house for drinks, which turns out to be the Polks' house (sentence 14-17).\n4. Eileen agrees to help Rebecca coerce Rita into admitting involvement in her son's abuse, and they drug Rita after she admits to enabling her husband's abuse (sentence 20-25).\n5. Eileen shoots Rita in the shoulder, and she and Rebecca plan to frame Jim for the shooting and run away together, but Rebecca betrays Eileen, leading to Eileen abandoning Rita in a remote forest (sentence 25-29).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: Eileen's state is one of isolation and longing. She is shunned by her colleagues and fantasizes about one of the guards, indicating a lack of fulfillment in her life. Meeting Rebecca brings a spark of interest and hope for connection.\n- **Event 2**: Eileen's state improves significantly as she experiences a night of freedom and connection with Rebecca. The kiss suggests a potential for romantic love and escape from her mundane and abusive home life.\n- **Event 3**: Initially, Eileen is disappointed by Rebecca's departure, indicating a reliance on Rebecca for emotional support. However, the invitation to the Polks' house rekindles her hope for a connection with Rebecca, albeit under deceitful circumstances.\n- **Event 4**: Eileen's state becomes more morally compromised as she participates in coercing Rita. Despite this, her actions are motivated by her desire to be with Rebecca, suggesting she is in a state of desperation and willingness to do anything for love and escape.\n- **Event 5**: Eileen's state reaches a peak of desperation and criminality. She shoots Rita and plans to frame her father, indicating a complete breakdown in her moral and legal boundaries. However, Rebecca's betrayal leads to Eileen's realization of her isolation and the depths of her actions, resulting in her abandoning Rita and leaving town, which can be seen as a form of escape or hitting rock bottom.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc can be classified by examining the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. Initially, Eileen is in a low state, feeling isolated and unfulfilled. She then experiences an improvement in her state with the introduction of Rebecca and their initial interactions. However, as the story progresses, Eileen becomes increasingly entangled in morally questionable and criminal activities, driven by her desire for Rebecca and escape from her life. The climax of the story involves Eileen hitting a low point morally and legally but then taking action (abandoning Rita and leaving) that can be seen as a form of liberation or escape from her situation.\n\nGiven these observations, the story does not fit neatly into the traditional \"Rags to Riches\" or \"Riches to Rags\" arc, as Eileen's condition does fluctuate but ends in a state that is arguably more liberated, albeit through questionable means. It also doesn't fit the \"Icarus\" arc perfectly because Eileen starts low, rises with Rebecca's influence, falls with the moral compromises, but ends in a state that is more about escape than downfall. The \"Man in a Hole\" arc seems closest because Eileen falls into a dilemma (her involvement with Rebecca's plans and her own moral compromises) and finds a way out (by abandoning Rita and leaving town), ending in a state that could be considered better than her starting point, given her escape from her abusive father and unfulfilling life.\n\n### 4.

seemingly disconnected estates — neighbours in proximity, yet distant otherwise, away from petites Pierres, their nearest settlement.\n3) The focus, then, shifts to Jacques, a grizzled, weather-beaten old farmer stooped over his abundance of golden wheat field.\n4) His eyes, though, hold a sorrow that belies his determined demeanor — a permanent void that had formed following the death of his

limitations in dealing with the realms of cultivation, she grudgingly concedes, and approaches Jacques, her experienced neighbor, hoping for his expertise.\n9) Jacques, albeit reluctant, decides to lend a helping hand.\n10) He crosses over the stone boundary that separates their estates, examines Mathilde's struggling lavender plants, and provides her with practical farming advice.\n11) Their

dying lavender but within their lives.\n30) The ending depicts the rejuvenated lavender fields mirroring the newfound peace within Jacques and Mathilde, signifying a closure and the promise of a new beginning.\n31) The closing scene captures their smiles, a token of their incredible journey towards healing, embedding upon its frame the essence of building genuine connections.\n32) As the scene gradually fades into the black, Jacques and Mathilde's shared laughter carries within it the warmth of the golden setting sun.\n33) An invigorated petites Pierres stands tall against the backdrop, a

However, for the purpose of analyzing the story arc, we can consider Jacques as the primary protagonist, given that his emotional journey and transformation are more explicitly described.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. The introduction of Jacques, showing his life after the loss of his wife (sentence 3-4).\n2. Mathilde's approach to Jacques for help with her wilting lavender plants, marking the beginning of their interaction (sentence 8).\n3. Jacques and Mathilde embarking on a joint expedition to find the mythical thistle seeds, symbolizing their growing connection and shared purpose (sentence 13).\n4. The deepening of their connection as they share their pasts and understand each other's loneliness (sentence 17-18).\n5. The culmination of their adventure with the discovery of the last thistle seed and the subsequent blossoming of Mathilde's field, symbolizing their healing and newfound companionship (sentence 19-21).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Jacques is introduced in a state of sorrow and silent seclusion following the death of his wife. His condition is one of emotional pain and isolation.\n- **Event 2**: When Mathilde approaches him for help, Jacques is still reluctant and withdrawn, indicating a minimal change in his emotional state. However, his decision to help marks a slight shift towards engagement with the world outside his grief.\n- **Event 3**: As Jacques and Mathilde embark on their expedition, Jacques begins to show signs of emotional opening. His knowledge of the land and participation in the adventure suggest a gradual improvement in his condition, as he starts to engage more actively with life.\n- **Event 4**: The sharing of their pasts deepens their connection, and for Jacques, this marks a significant step towards healing. His condition improves as he begins to confront and share his sorrow, indicating a move towards recovery.\n- **Event 5**: With the success of their adventure and the blossoming of Mathilde's field, Jacques's condition improves further. He experiences healing and finds companionship, which significantly enhances his emotional state compared to the beginning of the story.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the analysis, Jacques's condition throughout the story starts at a low point (due to his grief and isolation), improves gradually as he engages with Mathilde and their shared adventures, and ends at a higher point (with him finding healing and companionship). This pattern matches the **Man in a Hole** story arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (in this case, the grief and isolation following his wife's death) and finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To classify the story arc of the given narrative, let's follow the instructions step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the protagonist in the story, and identify 5 major events in the story.**\n\nThe protagonists of the story are Rosemary Muldoon and Anthony Reilly, but since the story arc classification is typically applied to a single protagonist's journey, we can consider the narrative to focus primarily on Anthony Reilly's transformation, given the significant character development and change he undergoes.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n- Event 1: Anthony's father, Tony, plans to disinherit him and sell the farm to his nephew Adam because Anthony seems incapable of marrying and continuing the family legacy (sentence 9).\n- Event 2: At Tony's 75th birthday party, Adam arrives and flirts with Rosemary, making Anthony realize his potential loss (sentence 13).\n- Event 3: Tony decides not to sell the farm to Adam, giving Anthony a chance to redeem himself and potentially marry Rosemary (sentence 17).\n- Event 4: After Tony's death, Anthony pushes Rosemary away, suggesting she leave Ireland, which seems like a step backward in his potential relationship with her (sentence 22).\n- Event 5: Anthony finally proposes to Rosemary after she finds the ring he had lost, and he confesses his secret and his love for her (sentence 30).\n\n2. **At each event, describe the protagonist's state and how it changed relative to the previous events.**\n\n- At Event 1, Anthony's state is one of potential loss and isolation. He's about to be disinherited and feels disconnected from his family's future and from Rosemary.\n- By Event 2, Anthony's state becomes more aware of his potential losses, not just the farm but also Rosemary to another man. This realization could motivate him to change.\n- At Event 3, Anthony's state improves slightly as he's given a second chance with the farm and potentially with Rosemary. However, his personal issues remain.\n- During Event 4, Anthony's state regresses as he pushes Rosemary away, indicating he still struggles with his personal demons and is not ready to accept love or connection.\n- By Event 5, Anthony's state has significantly improved. He's able to confront his issues, confess his love, and propose to Rosemary, showing considerable personal growth and a willingness to embrace connection and love.\n\n3. **Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain your reasoning.**\n\nThe story arc of Anthony Reilly can be classified based on how his condition changes throughout the narrative. Initially, Anthony is in a disadvantaged state, facing disinheritance and emotional isolation. However, through various events, he undergoes significant personal growth. He moves from a state of loss and isolation to one of connection and love, ultimately proposing to Rosemary and finding a sense of belonging and purpose.\n\nGiven this trajectory, the story arc fits the **Rags to Riches** pattern. Anthony starts in a poor emotional state, faces challenges, and through his journey, ends up in a much better state, having overcome his personal issues and found love and a sense of direction.\n\n4. **Determined story arc type:**\nRags to Riches"

        "output": "To classify the story arc type of the given story, let's follow the steps outlined in the task.\n\n1. **Identify the protagonist and 5 major events in the story:**\n\nThe protagonist of the story is the Smith family, but for the sake of analysis, we can consider Adam, the father, as the central figure around whom the story's progression is significantly influenced.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n- **Event 1:** The Smith family moves into the Antique Abode (sentence 5).\n- **Event 2:** Adam commences his role as the town librarian and is warned about the legendary haunted tales associated with the house (sentence 6).\n- **Event 3:** The family starts experiencing odd occurrences, such as moving objects and disembodied whispers (sentences 8-10).\n- **Event 4:** Laura and Timothy discover the hidden room and the leather-bound diaries detailing the previous occupants' similar experiences (sentences 12-16).\n- **Event 5:** The family, with the help of Mrs. Morton, performs a spiritual cleansing ritual to placate the house's ethereal inhabitants (sentences 23-26).\n\n2. **Describe the protagonist's state and how it changed relative to the previous events:**\n\n- **At Event 1:** Adam and the Smith family are in a state of transition and excitement about their new life in the Antique Abode. They are optimistic and looking forward to their new beginning.\n- **At Event 2:** Adam becomes aware of the potential supernatural issues with the house, but he remains skeptical. His state is one of cautious curiosity.\n- **At Event 3:** As the family experiences strange occurrences, their state changes to one of concern and slight fear. Adam's skepticism starts to wane.\n- **At Event 4:** The discovery of the diaries and learning about the house's dark past deepens the family's concern and fear. Adam's state shifts from skepticism to belief in the supernatural presence.\n- **At Event 5:** After performing the spiritual cleansing ritual, the family's state changes to one of relief and understanding. They find a way to coexist with the spirits, and their fear turns into a sense of harmony and acceptance.\n\n3. **Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain the reasoning:**\n\nThe story starts with the Smith family in a hopeful and optimistic state as they begin their new life. However, as they experience supernatural events, their state deteriorates to one of fear and concern. This downward trend represents the \"fall\" into a dilemma. Eventually, with the help of Mrs. Morton and the spiritual cleansing ritual, the family finds a way out of this dilemma, ending in a better state than when they first moved in, as they achieve a sense of peace and coexistence with the house's history and its spirits.\n\nThis pattern of falling into a problem and then finding a way out, ending in a better condition than at the beginning, aligns with the **Man in a Hole** story arc type. The protagonist (Adam/the Smith family) faces a dilemma (the supernatural occurrences and the fear they inspire), and through actions and newfound understanding, they manage to resolve the dilemma and emerge in a better state (a peaceful coexistence with the house's past).\n\n4. **Determined story arc type:**\nMan in a Hole"

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Kiera Woods. Here are 5 major events in the story:\n\n1. **Event 1**: The family moves into the old house (Sentence 1).\n2. **Event 2**: Ellie goes missing after the power outage and Kiera's investigation begins (Sentences 8-10).\n3. **Event 3**: Kiera discovers the mysterious equations in the cellar and starts to unravel the mystery of the house (Sentences 13-14).\n4. **Event 4**: Steven is taken by Baphomet, and Kiera finds herself in a desperate situation to save her family (Sentences 50-52).\n5. **Event 5**: Kiera rescues Ellie from the demonic dimension but ultimately succumbs to the counting, joining her family (Sentences 54-57).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **At Event 1**, Kiera's state is one of hope and new beginnings as she moves her family into a new home. Her condition is relatively high as she is optimistic about the future.\n- **At Event 2**, Kiera's state worsens significantly as her daughter goes missing, and she begins to feel a sense of loss and desperation. Her condition has dropped compared to the initial event.\n- **At Event 3**, Kiera's state improves slightly as she becomes more proactive in investigating the mystery of the house and the disappearance of her daughter. She is determined and engaged, which slightly elevates her condition from the previous low point.\n- **At Event 4**, Kiera's state drops again as she faces a new and more terrifying challenge with Steven being taken by Baphomet. This event marks a significant downfall in her condition as she feels helpless and frightened.\n- **At Event 5**, despite managing to rescue Ellie, Kiera's ultimate state is one of defeat and succumbing to the demonic influence, as indicated by her joining in the counting. This final state is the lowest point for Kiera, marking a complete downfall from her initial high point of moving into the new home with hopes and dreams.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the description of Kiera's state throughout the major events, the story arc can be analyzed as follows:\n\n- **Initial High Point**: Kiera starts in a hopeful state, moving into a new home.\n- **First Downfall**: Ellie goes missing, and Kiera's state worsens.\n- **Recovery**: Kiera starts investigating and finds clues, slightly improving her state.\n- **Second Downfall**: Steven is taken, and Kiera faces an even more terrifying situation, marking another significant drop in her condition.\n- **Final Downfall**: Despite rescuing Ellie, Kiera succumbs to the demonic influence, ending in the lowest state.\n\nThis pattern matches the **Oedipus** story arc type, where the protagonist starts high, falls, recovers slightly, and then faces another significant downfall, ending in an even lower state than before.\n\n### 4.

However, after confronting the entity and her fears, she emerges in a better state than before, showing resilience, a broader professional perspective, and personal growth.\n\nThis pattern follows the **Man in a Hole** story arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (in this case, facing supernatural events and deep personal fears) but finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning. Dr. Miller's journey is one of professional and personal growth, where she faces challenges, hits a low point, but ultimately rises above her initial state, armed with new insights and a stronger resolve.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Dr. Rose Cotter, a therapist who meets a patient named Laura Weaver at a psychiatric ward. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. Laura's death and Rose's initial exposure to the supernatural entity (sentences 1-4).\n2. Rose's realization that she is experiencing hallucinations and her concern for her own mental well-being (sentences 7-8).\n3. Rose's investigation into the entity and the discovery of a pattern of suicides (sentences 14-16).\n4. Rose's visit to Robert Talley, where she learns about the entity's true nature and how it feeds on trauma (sentence 21).\n5. Rose's final confrontation with the entity, leading to her possession and subsequent death (sentences 32-35).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **Initial Exposure (sentences 1-4):** Rose is a professional, composed therapist. After Laura's death, Rose is terrified, indicating a significant drop in her emotional and psychological state.\n\n2. **Realization of Hallucinations (sentences 7-8):** Rose's condition worsens as she begins to experience hallucinations, leading to concerns about her mental health. This event marks a further decline in her state compared to the initial event.\n\n3. **Investigation (sentences 14-16):** Rose is determined and proactive, trying to understand the entity. However, this determination is rooted in her growing desperation and fear, indicating that while she is taking action, her overall psychological state remains precarious and possibly worsening.\n\n4. **Visit to Robert Talley (sentence 21):** Rose learns the horrific truth about the entity and is faced with an impossible moral choice. This knowledge likely exacerbates her fear and desperation, further deteriorating her condition.\n\n5. **Final Confrontation (sentences 32-35):** Rose's state reaches its lowest point as she is possessed by the entity and dies, passing the curse on. This event signifies a complete downfall, both physically and psychologically.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the description of Rose's state throughout the major events, it's clear that her condition consistently worsens from the beginning to the end of the story. She starts as a composed professional and ends in a state of complete psychological and physical downfall. This pattern aligns with the **Riches to Rags** story arc type, where the protagonist begins in a high-status position (in this case, emotionally and professionally stable) and ends in a significantly lower state (completely consumed by the entity and dead).\n\n### 4.

Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n- **Event 1:** Alexander is in a state of frustration and boredom with his routine work life but becomes intrigued and motivated upon discovering the financial irregularity. His state changes from stagnant to engaged.\n- **Event 2:** Alexander transitions from being an individual with an idea to a leader of a group, the 'Legion of Cashiers'. His state changes from solo contemplation to collaborative action, indicating an increase in excitement and risk.\n- **Event 3:** With the successful execution of their scheme, Alexander feels a sense of accomplishment and possibly elation. His state changes from planning to success, marking a peak in his emotional and financial gain.\n- **Event 4:** Alexander and the team face fear, panic, and mistrust as their operation is threatened with discovery. His state changes from success to crisis, indicating a significant downturn in his emotional state.\n- **Event 5:** Alexander and the team decide to disband and return to their normal lives, but not before pulling off one last successful operation. Alexander's state changes from crisis to resolution and newfound contentment, as he reflects on the experiences and the personal growth, including a budding romance.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\nThe story arc can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout. Initially, Alexander is in a disadvantageous situation (bored and overlooked), which can be considered a \"low\" point. He then discovers an opportunity, forms a plan, and executes it successfully, reaching a \"high\" point. However, this success is followed by a crisis (the auditor's investigation and the team's internal conflicts), which represents a \"low\" point. Finally, Alexander and the team navigate this crisis, achieve one last success, and disband, returning to their normal lives but with personal growth and contentment, which can be seen as ending on a \"high\" note compared to where he started.\n\nGiven this pattern, the story fits the **Man in a Hole** arc because Alexander falls into a dilemma (the crisis with the auditor) but finds a way out, ending better than he was at the beginning (with personal growth, a romance, and a sense of fulfillment).\n\n### 4.

He is left behind by his crew and must fend for himself, feeling isolated and vulnerable.\n- **Event 4 (Reunion and Final Heist)**: Sebastian's state improves again as he reunites with Gwendoline and Korina. He regains a sense of belonging and purpose, and his skills are once more recognized and valued.\n- **Event 5 (Sacrifice and Escape)**: Sebastian's state is bittersweet. While he escapes and achieves a form of success, he loses Gwendoline, indicating a personal cost to his adventures.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story follows a pattern where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (being left behind by the crew) and then finds a way out (reuniting with part of the crew and achieving their goal). However, the story also involves a rise to success (participating in and succeeding at the heists) followed by a drastic downfall (Gwendoline's sacrifice). This combination suggests that the story could fit into more than one story arc type, but the overall trajectory from a mundane life to a life of adventure, followed by personal loss, leans towards a specific arc.\n\nGiven the protagonist starts in a disadvantaged situation (mundane life), rises to success and adventure (through the heists), faces setbacks (betrayal and pursuit), recovers, and ultimately ends in a bittersweet state (having achieved success but at personal cost), the story arc that best fits is one where the protagonist faces challenges, overcomes them, but ends in a state that reflects both gain and loss.\n\n### 4.

Her emotional stability decreases further as she grapples with her new reality.\n- **Event 3 (Liam's abduction):** Carla's state deteriorates significantly as she moves from a place of personal crisis to one of desperation and fear for her loved one. This is a low point for her.\n- **Event 4 (Rescue and confrontation):** Carla's state shows a marked improvement as she transitions from desperation to determination and action. She exhibits courage and resolve, indicating a rise in her emotional and psychological state.\n- **Event 5 (Success against the syndicate):** Carla's state reaches a new high as she and Liam succeed in their mission. She moves from a place of personal and relationship turmoil to one of resolution, strength, and a newfound sense of purpose.\n\n### 3. Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain the reasoning\n\nThe story arc of Carla Dempsey can be classified based on how her condition changes throughout the narrative. Initially, Carla is in a high state, enjoying a successful career and a loving relationship. The discovery of her adoption and the subsequent abduction of Liam represent significant downturns in her state, placing her in a \"hole\" of sorts. However, each time she faces a dilemma, she finds a way out, ending better than she was before. This pattern of falling into a problem and then recovering, only to face another challenge and recover again, suggests a specific story arc type.\n\nGiven that Carla faces two major cycles of dilemma and recovery (first, the crisis of identity and family secrets, and second, the abduction of Liam and the confrontation with the syndicate), and ends in a better state than where she began (with a stronger relationship, a new purpose, and personal growth), the story arc aligns with the characteristics of a **Double Man in a Hole**. This classification fits because Carla experiences two distinct periods of decline followed by recovery and growth, ultimately emerging stronger and in a better position than at the start of the story.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Brooke Gatwick, a young married woman trying to start a family and open her own art gallery. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. Brooke sees odd text messages on Owen's phone, making her think he might be cheating (Event 6).\n2. Brooke decides to go to Paris for a meeting about Ansgar's art, leaving Owen behind (Event 7).\n3. Brooke returns to New York and discovers Owen's infidelity with Amy, leading to a confrontation (Events 20-22).\n4. Brooke learns that Amy was hired by her as a test of Owen's faithfulness, and that Owen was actually working on a story, not cheating (Events 24-28).\n5. Brooke and Owen reconcile after the truth is revealed, and Brooke considers their future together (Events 38-39).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Brooke sees odd text messages):** Brooke's state changes from trusting to suspicious and worried about her marriage. This is a downturn in her emotional state.\n- **Event 2 (Brooke goes to Paris):** Brooke's decision to go to Paris, despite initial reluctance, shows her focusing on her career, potentially distancing herself from her marital issues. Her state is one of determination but also uncertainty about her marriage.\n- **Event 3 (Brooke discovers Owen's infidelity):** Brooke's state hits a low point as she feels betrayed and her trust is broken. This is a significant downturn in her emotional and marital state.\n- **Event 4 (Brooke learns the truth about Amy):** Brooke's state changes from anger and betrayal to guilt and possibly relief, as she learns that Owen was not cheating but rather her test backfired. This is an improvement in her state as the truth clarifies the situation.\n- **Event 5 (Brooke and Owen reconcile):** Brooke's state improves further as she and Owen reconcile, and she considers a positive future for them, including the possibility of starting a family. This is an upbeat in her emotional and marital state.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on Brooke's condition throughout the story, it can be observed that she faces two significant cycles of dilemma and recovery. Initially, she faces the dilemma of potential infidelity and marital issues, which leads to a low point when she discovers Owen with Amy. However, the truth about Amy's role and Owen's innocence leads to a recovery phase. Before this recovery is fully realized, Brooke's state was at a low due to the mistaken belief in Owen's infidelity, and then it improves as the truth comes out, and she and Owen work towards reconciliation. This pattern of falling into a dilemma (believing Owen is cheating) and then finding a way out (learning the truth and reconciling) fits the description of a \"Double Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist faces two cycles of falling into a problem and then recovering from it.\n\n### 4.

a resurgent threat that endangers national security and thumps the drumbeats of another bloody battle.\n33) Though retired and somewhat reluctant, John's senior instincts as an intelligence operative are struck awake once more by this harrowing revelation.\n34) Undeterred by the potential risk to his peaceful life, John jumps headfirst into the daunting task of decrypting the codes and hidden messages sequestered within Edward's posthumous correspondence.\n35) As he pieces the incriminating information together, John stumbles upon a chilling truth that cuts through him like a knife in the wind.\n36) Edward's demise was a meticulously planned murder.\n37) Overcome with a transforming sense of responsibility and a sudden renewal of his bedrock instincts, John resolutely steps out of the shadows of retirement, announcing his return to the twisted and dangerous world of espionage.\n38) Ignoring the silent threats hovering over his life, John embarks on yet another unsanctioned and potentially fatal mission that could once again put everything on the line.\n39) The climax takes us through a visual spectacle of John meticulously analyzing the documents he'd received, arranging them on a large map that ominously reveals an even broader, more sinister conspiracy at large.\n40) Overwhelmed by the daunting reality unfolding before his eyes and despite the strains of his advancing years, he decides to take on the invisible enemy lurking in the shadows of power and corruption.\n41) Embarking on a perilous mission, armed with decades of experience, John once again plunges headlong into a world filled with clandestine codes and diabolical conspiracies, all in a quest to protect his homeland.\n42) Staring down the barrel of imminent catastrophe, he single-handedly assumes the immense responsibility with grim determination — a solitary warrior pitted against a heavyweight consortium of power and corruption.\n43) Discarded by the government and his beloved agency, John's unflinching resolve to safeguard national security stands resolute and unbroken.\n44) Bearing the weight of explosive knowledge prompts John's determination to resurge, driving him to become an unlikely hero.\n45) A hero, whose only acknowledgement comes from the haunting reflection staring back at him.\n46) Raising the flag to wage another war against the formidable wheel of corruption, he stands unbowed by his status as a retired, forgotten, and disavowed CIA officer.\n47) The film's fade-out focuses on John's undeniably fierce determination reflected in the stark shadows of his dimly lit war room — a testament to his unshakeable resilience and setting the stage for another suspense-filled saga.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better (e.g., 0→1→2→4→10)\n- Riches to Rags: Protagonist starts high and ends lower (e.g., 10→9→8→6→0)\n- Man in a Hole: Protagonist falls into trouble but recovers (e.g., 6→2→1→4→10)\n- Icarus: Protagonist rises then falls dramatically (e.g., 2→4→9→5→1)\n- Double Man in a Hole: Two cycles of fall and recovery (e.g., 6→2→7→4→10)\n- Cinderella: Rise, setback, ultimate triumph (e.g., 1→7→4→1→10)\n- Oedipus: Start high, fall, recover, final fall (e.g., 10→4→7→9→1)",

Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **At Event 1 (Receiving the Letter)**: John is in a state of shock and reminiscence, forced to confront his past. His condition is one of disturbance from his peaceful retirement.\n- **At Event 2 (Infiltrating the Prison)**: John is proactive and determined, taking significant risks to uncover the truth. His condition has shifted from passive to active, improving his sense of purpose.\n- **At Event 3 (Betrayal and Operation Termination)**: John faces a setback, feeling betrayed and possibly demotivated. However, he quickly decides to continue, showing resilience. His condition worsens temporarily due to the betrayal but then stabilizes as he decides to proceed alone.\n- **At Event 4 (Uncovering the Truth)**: John is in a dangerous and precarious situation, having uncovered a large conspiracy. Despite the risks, he feels a sense of accomplishment and conviction in his mission. His condition improves as he gains more knowledge and feels he is doing the right thing, despite the dangers.\n- **At Event 5 (Receiving Edward's Posthumous Letter)**: John is once again thrust into a state of urgency and danger, forced to confront a new threat. However, he is determined and ready to act, showing growth and a continued commitment to justice. His condition, while challenging, reflects his readiness to face new challenges, indicating an overall improvement in his proactive stance against adversity.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the events and the protagonist's state at each, the story arc can be analyzed as follows:\n\n- John starts in a peaceful retirement, which is disrupted (a low point).\n- He then embarks on a risky mission, faces betrayal, but continues with determination (a cycle of dilemma and recovery).\n- After uncovering the truth and facing significant danger, John achieves a form of victory, though at personal cost (another recovery).\n- Finally, he is thrust into a new challenge but is ready and determined to face it (another cycle of potential dilemma and intended recovery).\n\nThis pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist faces multiple challenges, recovers, and grows, only to face another challenge. This is characteristic of the **Double Man in a Hole** story arc, where the protagonist experiences two cycles of falling into a dilemma and then recovering.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Courtland Gentry, also known as Sierra Six. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. **Event 1**: Courtland is offered his freedom in exchange for working as an assassin in the CIA's Sierra program (sentence 3).\n2. **Event 2**: Courtland, as Sierra Six, is working to assassinate a target named Dining Car in Bangkok (sentence 4).\n3. **Event 3**: Dining Car reveals he was also in the Sierra program and hands Six an encrypted drive detailing CIA corruption before dying (sentence 7).\n4. **Event 4**: Six's situation escalates as he is hunted by Lloyd Hansen, a mercenary hired by corrupt CIA official Denny Carmichael, and has to rescue Claire, Fitzroy's niece, who is being held hostage (sentences 10-14).\n5. **Event 5**: The final confrontation where Six faces off against Hansen, and subsequently, the aftermath where he deals with the consequences of his actions and the corruption within the CIA (sentences 32-39).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **At Event 1**: Courtland's state is one of confinement and limitation. He is a prisoner but is offered a chance for freedom, which is a significant improvement in his potential condition.\n- **At Event 2**: Courtland, now Sierra Six, is actively working for the CIA. His state has improved as he is no longer a prisoner and is using his skills for a purpose, albeit a dangerous one.\n- **At Event 3**: This event marks a turning point where Courtland discovers corruption within the CIA, which complicates his situation and puts him in greater danger. His state becomes more precarious as he now has to navigate not just his missions but also the internal corruption.\n- **At Event 4**: Courtland's state worsens significantly as he is pursued by a dangerous mercenary and has to rescue a hostage. This introduces a personal element to his conflict, raising the stakes.\n- **At Event 5**: The final confrontation shows Courtland overcoming immediate threats, but the aftermath reveals that he does not achieve a complete victory over the corruption. He has to make compromises and ensure the safety of those he cares about, which leaves his state somewhat improved from the immediate danger but still entangled in the complexities of his work and the corruption around him.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the changes in Courtland's state throughout the story, we can observe that he starts in a disadvantaged position (prisoner), rises to a position of action and purpose (working as Sierra Six), faces significant setbacks and dangers (discovering corruption and being hunted), and ultimately ends in a situation where he has overcome some challenges but not all, particularly the overarching corruption. This pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist faces a cycle of improvement and decline, with the final state being influenced by both the successes and the unresolved challenges.\n\nThe story arc that most closely matches this pattern is the **Oedipus** arc, characterized by a protagonist who starts high, falls, recovers, and then faces another significant downfall or challenge. In this case, Courtland's journey from prisoner to operative, then facing corruption and danger, and finally dealing with the aftermath and compromises, reflects a complex narrative of rise, fall, and partial recovery, aligning with the **Oedipus** story arc type.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Marcus Johnson, an experienced plumber. Five major events in the story can be identified as follows:\n\n1. **Event 1**: Marcus is chosen to spearhead the ground-breaking water treatment facility project (sentence 7).\n2. **Event 2**: Marcus discovers disturbing evidence that the project might not be as beneficial as believed, indicating covert plans and sly manipulations (sentence 9).\n3. **Event 3**: Marcus's revelations fall on disbelieving ears, and he faces opposition from the town and his own family (sentence 12 and 13).\n4. **Event 4**: Marcus embarks on a daring mission to gather concrete evidence to expose the deceit, leading to his isolation and the escalation of the emotional toll (sentence 17 and 18).\n5. **Event 5**: Marcus successfully exposes the fraudulent scheme with concrete proof, leading the town to unite against the project, and ultimately, the project is halted (sentence 22 and 27).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **At Event 1**: Marcus is in a high state, being chosen for a prestigious project that promises a brighter future and financial stability for his family.\n- **At Event 2**: Marcus's state changes to one of concern and disillusionment as he discovers the potential negative aspects of the project.\n- **At Event 3**: Marcus's state worsens as he faces disbelief and opposition, feeling isolated and doubted by those he trusts.\n- **At Event 4**: Marcus's determination remains strong, but his state in terms of social and emotional well-being deteriorates due to his isolation and the risks he takes to uncover the truth.\n- **At Event 5**: Marcus's state improves significantly as he succeeds in his mission, gains the trust and admiration of the town, and achieves a victory that protects the town's interests.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. Initially, Marcus is in a good position, chosen for a significant project (high point). However, as he delves deeper, he faces a dilemma upon discovering the project's true nature and the opposition he receives (fall into a hole). He then works to resolve this issue, facing further challenges and isolation (deeper into the hole). Ultimately, he succeeds in exposing the truth and saving the town, ending in a higher state than where he began (out of the hole and to a new high point).\n\nThis pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist falls into a dilemma but finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning. This description aligns with the **Man in a Hole** story arc, where the protagonist's condition improves from the first turning point to the last turning point, but given the specific details of facing two significant challenges (the discovery of the project's true nature and the battle to convince the town), it might also suggest elements of a **Double Man in a Hole**. However, the primary movement is from a high point, into a dilemma, and back out to an even higher point, which is most closely aligned with the **Man in a Hole** pattern when considering the overall trend of improvement after facing and overcoming challenges.\n\n### 4.

Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the story. Initially, Brian is in a high state, living a happy life. However, after the tragic loss of his son, he falls into a deep state of grief and revenge obsession, which compromises his relationships and well-being. He then rises to a peak of physical and strategic strength as he prepares for his revenge. Despite this rise, his overall condition (emotional and relational) does not improve and instead leads to a drastic downfall, culminating in his death.

Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1 (Sebastián's encounter with survivors):** Sebastián is introduced as a character who seems to be looking for a way to help others, or so it appears. His state is one of potential hope and usefulness to the group.\n- **Event 2 (Revelation as a seer):** Sebastián's true nature is revealed, showing him to be manipulative and dangerous to others. His state changes to one of darkness and isolation.\n- **Event 3 (Anna's death and apparition):** This event, though occurring before the main storyline, explains Sebastián's motivations. He is driven by a desire to \"save\" people as per Anna's apparition's instructions. His state is one of grief and misguided purpose.\n- **Event 4 (Change of heart):** Sebastián begins to doubt his actions and seeks to protect others, marking a significant improvement in his moral state. He moves towards redemption.\n- **Event 5 (Sebastián's death):** Sebastián dies after ensuring the safety of Claire and Sofia, symbolizing his complete redemption and sacrifice. His final state is one of peace and fulfillment.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the progression of Sebastián's character from a state of potential hope, to darkness and manipulation, to eventual redemption and sacrifice, the story arc can be seen as one of rise, fall, and ultimate rise again, but with a tragic end. This pattern does not perfectly fit the \"Cinderella\" arc provided in the examples, which typically involves a protagonist rising to a higher state after facing setbacks. Instead, Sebastián's journey is more complex, involving a fall into darkness and then a rise towards redemption, culminating in a sacrificial act that saves others.\n\nThe closest match from the provided arc types, considering Sebastián's descent into darkness and his eventual redemption, would be more aligned with a character who faces significant challenges and changes, rather than a straightforward rise or fall. However, none of the provided examples perfectly capture the essence of Sebastián's journey, which involves both a moral descent and a subsequent ascent towards redemption.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identification of Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Sarah Thompson, a lifestyle blogger living in Brooklyn, New York. The five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Discovery of the Fujifilm**: Sarah finds a dust-covered, antiquated roll of Fujifilm at a flea market, which reveals images of heinous crimes in her neighborhood (sentence 3).\n2. **Shift in Blog Theme**: Sarah changes the theme of her blog to investigate these local crimes, surprising her followers (sentence 4).\n3. **Narrow Escape from Attack**: Sarah narrowly escapes a covert attack after visiting a warehouse implicated in her investigation (sentence 7).\n4. **Live Event on Instagram**: Sarah and her husband James hold a live event on Instagram, revealing evidence and identifying the criminals (sentence 10).\n5. **Resolution and New Beginning**: The live event leads to law enforcement capturing the criminals, and Sarah decides to use her platform for social justice and environmental issues (sentences 11-12).\n\n### 2. Description of Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Discovery of the Fujifilm)**: Sarah's state changes from peaceful and serene to intrigued and alarmed. She moves from a state of ignorance about the crimes in her neighborhood to being aware and concerned.\n- **Event 2 (Shift in Blog Theme)**: Sarah's state transitions from being merely a lifestyle blogger to an investigative blogger, which surprises her followers. This shift indicates her commitment to uncovering the truth about the crimes, showing a proactive and determined state.\n- **Event 3 (Narrow Escape from Attack)**: Sarah's state becomes one of fear and vulnerability. The attack makes her realize the danger of her investigations, potentially making her question her decision to pursue the story.\n- **Event 4 (Live Event on Instagram)**: Sarah's state shows resilience and courage. Despite the previous attack and the danger, she decides to go public with her findings, indicating a strong determination to see justice served.\n- **Event 5 (Resolution and New Beginning)**: Sarah's state evolves to one of empowerment and purpose. She not only helps in capturing the criminals but also decides to expand her platform's focus to include social justice and environmental issues, showing growth and a newfound sense of responsibility.\n\n### 3. Classification of Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, it can be observed that Sarah starts in a good state (as a successful blogger), falls into a dilemma (upon discovering the crimes and facing danger), and then finds a way out (by successfully exposing the criminals and deciding to use her platform for greater good). This pattern aligns with the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist faces a problem, hits a low point, and then recovers to an even better state than before. Sarah's journey from being a lifestyle blogger to becoming an advocate for social justice, coupled with her personal growth and the strengthening of her relationship with her husband, demonstrates this arc. She ends up in a better state than where she started, having grown both personally and professionally.\n\n### 4. Determined Story Arc Type\n\nMan in a Hole"

M. Barrie's book Peter Pan and Wendy and Lucy seems to see Peter Pan's shadow morph into a weird expanding bloodstain on the book cover.\n20) Lucy confronts her and Corgan admits that she now consults Hindle too and that she gave the file to Adrian due to her worry about Lucy's mental state.\n21) She tells Lucy that Adrian denies he has a safe in his office.\n22) Lucy experiences contractions and goes to Grace to give birth, discovering she is giving birth to the male twins instead of the female baby.\n23) Before she can birth the second twin, Grace urges them to a hospital after strong bleeding but Adrian takes her to Hindle, who delivers the second baby.\n24) Disillusioned and depressed, Lucy talks to Grace but realizes that the image of her as an African-American midwife 'goddess' was unrealistic and elaborated.\n25) Grace tells Lucy that she must solve her own problem.\n26) Lucy goes to Hindle's clinic to confront him, where she is shocked to learn Adrian will join Hindle's gynecological practice.\n27) Lucy sneaks into a secret room labelled \"The Lab\" in the clinic, where she finds her removed placenta and reduced female fetus.\n28) Hindle reveals it was his sperm used for inseminating Lucy, as he does with all his patients, believing his genes to be superior.\n29) He has a refrigerator full of vials of his own sperm which are used to inseminate his female patients and spread his own bloodline further through the world through male births.\n30) He attempts to drug Lucy but she kicks him and smashes his head with a mirror, then restrains him to a medical chair, after which she is attacked by a nurse, Dawn.\n31) She drugs Dawn and beats Hindle bloody, destroying his refrigerator full of sperm vials and leaving the office with the fetus.\n32) Arriving home, she imagines herself releasing the twins to float out the window (a reference to the Peter Pan and Wendy submotif of the narrative).\n33) When Adrian comes home, he claims that the deal with Hindle would have been good for them both.\n34) Lucy gives him the twins and orders him to leave.\n35) She then picks up the female fetus and attempts to breastfeed it, hallucinating that it begins to suckle.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better (e.g., 0→1→2→4→10)\n- Riches to Rags: Protagonist starts high and ends lower (e.g., 10→9→8→6→0)\n- Man in a Hole: Protagonist falls into trouble but recovers (e.g., 6→2→1→4→10)\n- Icarus: Protagonist rises then falls dramatically (e.g., 2→4→9→5→1)\n- Double Man in a Hole: Two cycles of fall and recovery (e.g., 6→2→7→4→10)\n- Cinderella: Rise, setback, ultimate triumph (e.g., 1→7→4→1→10)\n- Oedipus: Start high, fall, recover, final fall (e.g., 10→4→7→9→1)",

Lucy confronts Dr. Hindle, discovers his sinister plans, and takes action against him (Events 29-31).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Pregnancy):** Lucy's state improves as she achieves her goal of becoming pregnant. She is hopeful and likely happy.\n- **Event 2 (Decision on Selective Reduction):** Lucy's state becomes more complex, with a mix of relief and anxiety. She has made a decision that aligns with her desires but also faces the risks associated with a multiple pregnancy.\n- **Event 3 (Discovery of Monitoring):** Lucy's state worsens as she feels betrayed and unsafe. Her trust in her husband and Dr. Hindle begins to erode.\n- **Event 4 (Birth and Revelation):** Lucy's state deteriorates further. She experiences disillusionment, depression, and a sense of loss upon discovering she gave birth to the twins instead of the daughter she wanted to keep. The revelation about Dr. Hindle's true intentions and actions plunges her into a deeper crisis.\n- **Event 5 (Confrontation with Dr. Hindle):** Lucy's state begins to improve as she takes control and acts against those who have wronged her. Despite the traumatic nature of her actions, she is empowered by her decision to confront Dr. Hindle and stop his sinister plans.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc can be classified based on how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the narrative. Initially, Lucy's condition improves with her pregnancy, but it worsens as she uncovers the truth about Dr. Hindle and her husband's involvement. She faces a significant downfall, hitting a low point after the birth and the revelations that follow. However, she then begins to recover by taking action against her adversaries, which marks an improvement in her condition.\n\nThis pattern resembles the \"Double Man in a Hole\" story arc because Lucy faces two cycles of dilemma and recovery. The first cycle starts with her hope and happiness about the pregnancy, followed by a decline into fear, betrayal, and health issues. The second cycle begins with her hitting a low point after the birth and revelations, followed by a recovery as she takes action against Dr. Hindle and her husband.\n\n### 4.

indomitable security.\n2) Hidden away from prying eyes, in the prison's depths, exists a complex labyrinth of clandestine laboratories, running classified and covert scientific experiments.\n3) Our protagonist, John Kelly, is a grizzled veteran from the legendary Navy SEAL Team 6.\n4) After a shift in tides, Kelly found a new calling, becoming an intensive investigative journalist for the influential 'Public Eye Online News', a renowned digital news platform.\n5) On one ordinary day, Kelly uncovers a bewildering incident: Jack Rutledge, a notorious global arms dealer who has been serving a lifetime sentence at Ironhold, has been released without explanation.\n6) Unsatisfied with the vagueness surrounding Rutledge's abrupt freedom, Kelly probes deeper, only to be met with bureaucratic roads blocks and evasive communications.\n7) This only escalates his suspicion about Ironhold's murky operation.\n8) Kelly, fuelled by an unwavering sense of justice, boldly plans to infiltrate Ironhold.\n9) His plan involves blending in by enrolling himself in the demanding New York corrections officer training program.\n10) Impressive performance founded on his military experience secures his placement at Ironhold.\n11) There, Kelly first encounters Dr. Rachel Symons, a lead scientist of prominent stature, who is deeply involved in top-secret operations.\n12) Despite the stark differences in their positioning, an unlikely companionship emerges between Kelly and Symons.\n13) This companionship is complex, filled with restrained fervor, blurred ethical lines, and unexpected respect.\n14) Under the disguise of a seasoned correction officer, Kelly commences his clandestine investigation from within the futuristic, heavily fortified Ironhold walls.\n15) A hushed whisper amongst inmates about Eddie Deacon, a fellow prisoner who mysteriously \"vanished\" from their supervised block, captures Kelly's attention, forming his first significant lead.\n16) As Kelly delves into Deacon's peculiar disappearance, he stumbles upon a potential dangerous link between this case and the secretive scientific experiments carried out in Ironhold's hidden laboratories.\n17) Diving deeper into Ironhold's labyrinth, he discovers a terrifying plot: the prisoners are allegedly used as guinea pigs for illegal, involuntary human trials that are cloaked as 'rehabilitation programs'.\n18) Each piece of evidence unearthed pushes Kelly closer towards a bone-chilling revelation.\n19) The clandestine experiments harbored dangerous aftereffects, capable of unpredictable changes, potentially lethal.\n20) Risking his covert operation, Kelly bravely confronts Dr. Symons, nudging at the ethical implications of her discreet work within the labs.\n21) In an unexpected turn, Symons seems shocked beyond words, clearly unaware of the dire consequences her scientific breakthroughs could have potentially induced.\n22) Following perpetual data investigation, Kelly procures the conclusive evidence: a DNA analysis report that confirms the destructive impact of an experimental serum on Deacon's DNA.\n23) Kelly's plans to leak this bombshell evidence are abruptly foiled, leading to his cover being blown.\n24) This revelation triggers an immediate response within the high echelons of Ironhold's management.\n25) Learning about Kelly's double persona, a stunned Dr. Symons faces an ethical dilemma: Does she side with the startling revelations Kelly has to offer, or does she remain faithful to her questionable employer?\n26) As she wrestles with the weight of her unwitting contributions to the appalling activities, Symons finds herself leaning towards Kelly's side.\n27) Forming an unlikely alliance, Symons and Kelly craft a risky but daring plan: abscond from the tightly guarded Ironhold while simultaneously setting in motion an information leak.\n28) Driven by their unwavering belief, they navigate through the convoluted Ironhold security system, narrowly avoiding detection and capture.\n29) Fleeing to a safe haven in the distant lands of Salt Lake City, they contact 'The Tribune', a revered news organization.\n30) They upload all the incriminating materials and evidence they've gathered on their dangerous journey.\n31) The shocking revelations lead to an international uproar, inviting the wrath and serious attention of globally renowned human rights organizations.\n32) Before a grand jury specially convened for this case, Dr. Symons corroborates Kelly's unsettling disclosures, shedding light on the government's morally reprehensible human trials.\n33) The final scenes show a drastically changed Ironhold.\n34) Once a den for illicit human experimentation, it's now operated as a conventional prison.\n35) At the same time, Kelly, standing before his public, delivers another mind-blowing expos'.\n36) The narrative concludes with a tease - a classified document named \"Project Phoenix\" found in a similar Washington facility, implying that humans are still being used in illicit experiments.\n37) The possibility of a sequel where these horrors continue continues to loom ominously.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to

Kelly and Dr. Symons form an alliance, escape Ironhold, and leak the incriminating evidence to the public (sentences 27-30).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Kelly is in a state of professional curiosity and moral outrage upon discovering Rutledge's unexplained release. His condition is one of heightened awareness and readiness to investigate further.\n- **Event 2**: Kelly's condition improves as he successfully infiltrates Ironhold, marking a significant step forward in his investigation. He is now in a position of strategic advantage, closer to uncovering the truth.\n- **Event 3**: Upon discovering the illegal human trials, Kelly's state becomes one of grave concern and urgency. His moral outrage intensifies, and he is more determined than ever to expose the truth. This event deepens his understanding of the situation but also increases the risk and complexity of his mission.\n- **Event 4**: When Kelly's cover is blown, his state worsens dramatically. He faces immediate danger, and his ability to continue the investigation is severely compromised. This is a significant downturn in his condition.\n- **Event 5**: Finally, after forming an alliance with Dr. Symons and successfully leaking the evidence, Kelly's condition improves significantly. He achieves his goal of exposing the truth, ensuring justice, and bringing about change. This marks a high point in his condition, where he not only resolves the conflict but also emerges as a hero.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, it can be observed that Kelly faces a dilemma (uncovering the truth about Ironhold) and finds a way out (exposing the illegal activities), ending in a better state than when he started. However, his journey includes a significant downturn (his cover being blown) before he recovers and succeeds. This pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist faces challenges, overcomes them, and emerges in a better condition, which is characteristic of the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc. The presence of two cycles of dilemma and recovery (first, the challenge of infiltrating and investigating Ironhold, and second, the danger after his cover is blown and his subsequent escape and exposure of the truth) could suggest a \"Double Man in a Hole\" story arc. However, the classic definition of \"Double Man in a Hole\" involves two complete cycles of falling into a dilemma and recovering, which might not perfectly align with the narrative's progression here. Nonetheless, the story clearly shows Kelly facing significant challenges, experiencing setbacks, and ultimately achieving a triumphant outcome, which aligns more closely with the spirit of a \"Man in a Hole\" or a variant thereof.\n\n### 4.

Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Jeff, an inmate at Spiderhead, a state-of-the-art penitentiary where experiments with research chemicals are conducted.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. Jeff is given N-40, a \"love drug\", which distorts his senses and drives him to have sex with two of his fellow inmates (sentence 6).\n2. Heather commits suicide while on the Darkenfloxx after Jeff reluctantly agrees to her being administered the drug (sentence 11).\n3. Jeff discovers that there are no \"higher-ups\" and that the prison is run by Abnesti Pharmaceuticals, Steve's company (sentence 14).\n4. Jeff forces Steve to admit the true goal of the program and takes control of Steve's MobiPak (sentence 22).\n5. Jeff and Lizzy escape from Spiderhead after overpowering some of the other inmates (sentence 30).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1 (Jeff is given N-40):** Jeff's state is one of emotional turmoil, still reeling from his past actions. The administration of N-40 introduces chaos and confusion into his life, as his emotions and perceptions are altered.\n- **Event 2 (Heather's suicide):** Jeff's state worsens as he experiences horror and guilt over Heather's death. This event deepens his emotional turmoil and introduces a sense of responsibility and regret.\n- **Event 3 (Discovery of Abnesti Pharmaceuticals' control):** Jeff's state begins to shift towards empowerment and distrust. He starts to question the true motives behind the experiments and feels a sense of betrayal, which motivates him to take action.\n- **Event 4 (Forcing Steve to admit the truth):** Jeff's state improves significantly as he gains control and understanding. He transitions from being a victim of the experiments to becoming an active participant in his own destiny, seeking to expose the truth and protect himself and others.\n- **Event 5 (Escape from Spiderhead):** Jeff's state reaches a peak of liberation and hope. He and Lizzy escape, symbolizing a new beginning and a chance for redemption and forgiveness.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. Initially, Jeff is in a low state, struggling with guilt and the consequences of his actions. He then faces a series of challenges and downturns, particularly with Heather's suicide, which worsens his condition. However, as he discovers the truth about the facility and takes action against Steve, Jeff's condition begins to improve. He experiences a significant uplift when he forces Steve to admit the truth and when he and Lizzy escape, marking a transition from a state of oppression and guilt to one of freedom and hope.\n\nThis pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist faces significant challenges, falls into a dilemma, but then finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning. This is characteristic of the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist's condition improves from the first turning point to the last turning point. However, given the complexity and the dual nature of Jeff's journey (facing a dilemma, finding a temporary resolution, facing another dilemma, and then finally escaping), it could also align with the \"Double Man in a Hole\" arc, which involves two cycles of dilemma and recovery.\n\nGiven the provided classification of the story arc as \"Double Man in Hole,\" it seems to accurately reflect Jeff's journey, as he experiences multiple lows (the aftermath of the car accident, Heather's death, the revelation about the facility) and highs (discovering the truth, escaping with Lizzy), indicative of facing and overcoming multiple challenges.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Jack Thompson, a notably brilliant surgeon and the single father of two daughters, Amanda and Sophie. However, considering the story's focus on the family's journey and emotional growth, it can be argued that the protagonist is the Thompson family as a whole.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. The Thompson family attends the funeral of their beloved mother (sentence 1).\n2. Jack plans a surprise family adventure to Africa to help cope with their grief (sentence 4).\n3. The family encounters and helps a critically injured bull elephant, which moves them to extend their stay and aid more animals (sentences 17-20).\n4. The Thompsons decide to ally with the Kenyan Wildlife Service to combat wildlife poachers (sentence 26).\n5. The family successfully stands against the poachers, leading to a healing experience and a new sense of purpose (sentences 29-34).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **At the funeral (Event 1):** The Thompson family is in a state of profound grief and sadness, having just lost their mother. This is a low point for the family, emotionally overwhelmed and struggling to cope.\n\n2. **Planning the adventure (Event 2):** Jack, trying to be resilient for his daughters, decides to take them on an adventure. This shows a slight improvement in their condition as they are attempting to find ways to deal with their grief, but they are still deeply affected by their loss.\n\n3. **Helping the injured elephant (Event 3):** This event marks a significant turning point where the family starts to find solace and purpose beyond their grief. Helping the elephant brings them closer together and starts to alleviate their sorrow, replacing it with a sense of fulfillment.\n\n4. **Allying with the Kenyan Wildlife Service (Event 4):** By deciding to combat wildlife poachers, the Thompsons are taking a proactive step towards healing and finding a new purpose in life. This indicates a further improvement in their emotional state as they are now channeling their grief into positive action.\n\n5. **Standing against the poachers (Event 5):** Successfully confronting the poachers and protecting the wildlife not only strengthens their bond as a family but also significantly heals their emotional wounds. This event marks a high point for the family, where they have found a new sense of purpose and have begun to move on from their grief.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc of the Thompson family can be classified based on how their condition changes throughout the narrative. Starting from a low point of grief, they experience a rise as they find purpose and healing through their actions in Africa. There is a setback when they encounter the harsh reality of poaching, but ultimately, they achieve a higher state by overcoming this challenge and finding a new sense of purpose.\n\nThis pattern aligns with the **Cinderella** story arc type, where the protagonist rises, faces a setback, and ultimately achieves a higher state. The Thompson family's journey from grief to finding purpose and overcoming challenges reflects this arc. They start in a disadvantaged emotional state, face setbacks (such as the encounter with poachers), but ultimately end in a better state, having healed and found a new purpose.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To classify the story arc type, let's first identify the protagonist and 5 major events in the story.\n\n1. **Protagonist Identification**: The protagonist of the story is Dr. Nate Samuels, a recently widowed father trying to reconnect with his daughters.\n\n2. **5 Major Events**:\n   - Event 1: Nate arrives at the Mopani Reserve with his daughters ( Sentence 1).\n   - Event 2: Nate and his family encounter a rogue lion, leading to Martin's mauling (Sentences 11-12).\n   - Event 3: Nate and his daughters manage to escape from the lion temporarily and are taken in by poachers, who later try to harm them (Sentences 21-23).\n   - Event 4: Martin sacrifices himself to save Nate and the girls, and they escape from the poachers and the lion (Sentences 25-26).\n   - Event 5: Nate ultimately defeats the rogue lion with the help of the local lion pride and reunites with his daughters, ending the story on a positive note (Sentences 32-36).\n\n3. **Protagonist's State and Change at Each Event**:\n   - **Event 1**: Nate is in a state of grief and guilt, trying to reconnect with his daughters after his wife's death. His condition is emotionally low.\n   - **Event 2**: Nate's physical and emotional state become more dire as he faces the danger of the rogue lion and sees his friend Martin get mauled. His condition worsens.\n   - **Event 3**: Nate and his daughters find temporary refuge with the poachers, but the situation quickly turns dangerous again. Nate's condition remains precarious and dangerous.\n   - **Event 4**: After Martin's sacrifice, Nate is filled with a mix of emotions - sadness over the loss of his friend and determination to save his daughters. His physical condition becomes more vulnerable due to the lion's attack, but his emotional state starts to shift towards resilience and determination.\n   - **Event 5**: Nate defeats the lion and reunites with his daughters, symbolizing a recovery from his grief and a newfound strength in his relationship with his daughters. His condition improves significantly, both emotionally and physically, as he finds closure and a way to move forward with his life.\n\n4. **Story Arc Classification**: Based on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, it starts with Nate in a low emotional state (grief and guilt), faces significant challenges and dangers (worsening condition), and ultimately ends with Nate overcoming these challenges, reconnecting with his daughters, and finding a sense of peace and new beginnings (improved condition). This pattern follows a protagonist who falls into a dilemma (the death of his wife, the rogue lion, and the poachers) and finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning.\n\n**Man in a Hole**"

Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Meeting with Mr. Katano and the subsequent death of Mr. Katano (sentences 1-5)**: This event sets the stage for Robert's journey, showing his initial aspirations and the sudden loss of his mentor.\n2. **Robert's decision to pursue a career in art and his move to independence (sentences 12-13)**: This marks a significant turning point where Robert decides to leave his comfort zone and pursue his dreams, despite his parents' disappointment.\n3. **Robert's involvement with Wallace, including the attempted assault on the pharmacist (sentences 15-22)**: This event introduces a new challenge and moral dilemma for Robert, testing his character and decision-making.\n4. **The drawing lesson with Wallace and the ensuing chaos (sentences 24-34)**: This event represents a peak in Robert's troubles, where his attempts to learn from Wallace end in disaster, including violence and betrayal.\n5. **The aftermath of the chaos with Wallace, where Robert ends up bruised and contemplating his situation (sentences 35-37)**: This final event shows Robert at a low point, physically and emotionally, reflecting on the consequences of his actions and decisions.\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Robert starts in a state of aspiration and potential, seeking guidance from Mr. Katano. The sudden death of Mr. Katano leaves Robert in a state of loss and uncertainty.\n- **Event 2**: Robert decides to take control of his life, pursuing art and independence. This move suggests an improvement in his state, as he's taking proactive steps towards his goals, albeit with the risk of uncertainty and potential failure.\n- **Event 3**: Robert's involvement with Wallace introduces a significant downturn. Robert becomes entangled in unethical and dangerous situations, indicating a worsening of his state as he compromises his values and safety.\n- **Event 4**: The situation with Wallace escalates, leading to violence and betrayal. This represents a further decline in Robert's state, as he faces physical harm and emotional distress.\n- **Event 5**: After the chaos, Robert is left broken and bruised, both physically and emotionally. This event signifies a low point for Robert, where he must confront the consequences of his decisions and the state of his life.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the progression of Robert's state throughout the story, we observe an initial pursuit of dreams and independence (an improvement), followed by a series of deteriorating events involving Wallace, which lead to a significant downfall (a worsening of his state). This pattern, where the protagonist starts in a relatively positive state, faces a series of challenges that lead to a decline, and ends in a lower state than where he began, aligns with the **Oedipus** story arc type. The Oedipus arc is characterized by a protagonist who starts high, falls, recovers, and then faces another significant downfall. In Robert's case, his decision to pursue art and his initial steps towards independence can be seen as a high point, followed by a fall into trouble with Wallace, a brief attempt to recover through seeking guidance, and then another downfall into violence and betrayal.\n\n### 4.

game-changing serum aimed at reversing the abnormal growth patterns, theoretically resizing the creatures to their original harmless state.\n17) Courageously, they decide to administer their newly engineered serum as an attempt to reclaim their besieged world.\n18) Braving unforeseeable dangers, this brave cadre of scientists delve into the ominous, labyrinthine lairs of these monstrous beasts.\n19) Imploring unyielding courage in the face of deathly peril, these valiant men and women administer the miracle serum to the leviathan creatures.\n20) To their indescribable relief, the once fearsome behemoths gradually shrink down to a harmless size, complying with their desperate pleas for mercy.\n21) As the city-shaking roars of the beasts gradually subside to mere squeaks, and the colossal devastation halts, the battered beings under its reign perceive a glimmer of hope.\n22) However, their moment of victory is abruptly truncated by the surfacing of a new terror — a Godzilla-sized monstrosity that is deemed king among the giant reptiles.\n23) Even as this new challenge looms ahead, Emily and Jack, the unshaken defenders of humankind, rally global forces to stand their ground and continue battling the immense creature.\n24) Seizing courage from the jaws of fear, Emily enters the danger zone — directly into the path of the gigantic creature — to take a shot at administering the final dose of the shrinking serum.\n25) As the serum takes effect, her heroic act causes inadvertent disturbance among the meteor debris peacefully orbiting in the Earth's outer space.\n26) This disturbance turns lethal as it triggers a chain reaction sending an even more massive meteor, double the size of its predecessor, spiraling towards earth at an alarming speed.\n27) Earth's inhabitants once again find themselves engulfed in terror.\n28) Understanding the gravity of the situation, Emily hastily devises a counter strategy using cutting-edge laser technology to pulverize the incoming meteor.\n29) Emily, under the hopeful gaze of the entire human race, fires a colossal laser from Earth's newly developed defense cannon built by SpaceX.\n30) The laser strikes true; reducing the monstrous rock into beautiful yet harmless fragments that burn like a cosmic firework in the night sky.\n31) As the meteor fragments fall harmlessly into the sea, the world heaves a sigh of relief.\n32) Emily, Jack, and their team become overnight heroes, celebrated in every nook and corner for their indomitable bravery.\n33) From the sandstone depths of America's Grand Canyon to

reveling in their newfound victory, an ominous specter emerges from the shadows — a surviving colossal reptile, previously unnoticed.\n38) As a leviathan silhouette ominously lurks on the outskirts of a joyful Paris, the jubilant survivors remain oblivious.\n39) Did their efforts bring only temporary respite or did they manage to establish a permanent solution?\n40) Leaving their imprint, the filmmakers hint at future conflicts with potential reptilian threats, driving anticipation for sequel.\n41) However, humanity rests easy knowing that in Emily and Jack, they have dedicated defenders always ready to brace against the next possible onslaught.\n42) As the screen edges towards darkness, we're offered a final chilling glimpse of a monstrous silhouette, teasing unimaginable dangers ahead.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better (e.g., 0→1→2→4→10)\n- Riches to Rags: Protagonist starts high and ends lower (e.g., 10→9→8→6→0)\n- Man in

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonists in the story are Emily, an astronomer, and Jack, a biologist. However, since the story often focuses on their collective efforts and the narrative frequently shifts between their perspectives and actions, it's reasonable to consider them as joint protagonists or to focus on the overall human condition as the protagonist. For the purpose of this analysis, we'll consider Emily as the primary protagonist due to her initial discovery and pivotal role in the resolution of the crisis.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. **Discovery of the Meteor**: Emily discovers a massive meteor heading towards Earth (sentence 2).\n2. **Impact and Initial Aftermath**: The meteor hits Earth, causing widespread destruction and triggering reptilian mutations (sentences 6-9).\n3. **Development of a Solution**: Emily and Jack develop a serum to reverse the mutations (sentences 15-16).\n4. **Administration of the Serum and Initial Success**: They successfully administer the serum, shrinking the mutated reptiles (sentences 18-20).\n5. **Final Confrontation and Resolution**: Emily devises a plan to destroy a second, larger meteor using laser technology, saving Earth (sentences 28-30).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Discovery of the Meteor)**: Emily's state changes from one of professional routine to alarm and concern. She moves from a position of control and normalcy to one of crisis.\n- **Event 2 (Impact and Initial Aftermath)**: Emily's state worsens as the crisis deepens. She is now dealing with the reality of an impending global catastrophe.\n- **Event 3 (Development of a Solution)**: Emily's state begins to improve as she and Jack find a potential solution to the crisis. This marks a turning point from despair to hope.\n- **Event 4 (Administration of the Serum and Initial Success)**: Emily's state improves significantly as their plan succeeds, and the immediate threat is mitigated. She experiences a sense of relief and accomplishment.\n- **Event 5 (Final Confrontation and Resolution)**: Emily's state faces a final challenge but ultimately ends on a high note with the successful destruction of the second meteor. She emerges as a hero, having saved humanity from two major threats.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc can be classified based on how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the narrative. Given the events described:\n- The protagonist starts in a state of normalcy (or \"riches\" in terms of personal and professional stability).\n- Faces a significant downfall or challenge (the meteor impact and its aftermath, moving into a \"hole\").\n- Recovers or finds a way out of this dilemma (developing and successfully administering the serum, improving their state).\n- Faces another challenge (the second, larger meteor, potentially falling back into a \"hole\").\n- Ultimately overcomes this challenge as well (destroying the second meteor, ending in a better state than at the beginning).\n\nThis pattern suggests a **Double Man in a Hole** story arc because the protagonist faces two major challenges (two \"holes\") and recovers from both, ending in a better state than where they started.\n\n### 4.

His condition worsens emotionally as he realizes what he might have lost.\n\n5. **Fifth Event (Realization and reconciliation):** Tim's state transforms from one of regret and possibly self-destruction (acting outlandishly and getting hurt) to self-awareness and appreciation for Missy's unique qualities. He takes actions to correct his past mistakes, and his condition improves as he reconciles with Missy.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, it starts with Tim in a hopeful state that quickly deteriorates into disaster and embarrassment. However, as the story progresses, despite facing further setbacks and humiliations, Tim's condition improves as he begins to appreciate Missy and eventually wins her back. This pattern suggests that the story follows a **Man in a Hole** arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (or multiple dilemmas) but finds a way out, ending in a better state than at the beginning. The key characteristic of this arc is the protagonist's ability to recover and improve their condition after facing significant challenges.\n\n### 4. Determined Story Arc Type\n\nMan in a Hole"

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Jack, a meticulous and hardworking architect from New York. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. Jack receives an electrifying job offer to design a 50-story office skyscraper in Berlin, Germany (sentence 2).\n2. He finds a stranger, Eric, in his leased apartment, leading to a dispute over rightful ownership (sentence 7).\n3. Jack and Eric agree to room together temporarily until a solution is reached, despite their differences (sentence 13).\n4. Eric's lease is declared null due to a clerical error, and Jack decides to help Eric wage a legal battle for his housing rights (sentences 24-29).\n5. They succeed in overturning the eviction notice, securing Eric's right to the apartment, and decide to continue their living arrangement, celebrating their unique bond and personal growth (sentences 30-34).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1:** Jack is overjoyed and anticipating a significant career advancement. His state is positive and hopeful.\n- **Event 2:** Jack's state changes to one of frustration and conflict as he encounters an unexpected obstacle (Eric) in his new apartment. His condition worsens compared to the initial optimism.\n- **Event 3:** Despite the initial conflict, Jack and Eric find a compromised living situation. Jack's state improves slightly as he finds a temporary solution to his housing issue, though it's not ideal.\n- **Event 4:** Jack's state worsens again as he faces a new challenge—helping Eric with his legal battle—on top of his professional pressures. This adds stress and responsibility.\n- **Event 5:** Jack's state improves significantly as he and Eric succeed in their legal battle, and they decide to maintain their living arrangement. This outcome represents a resolution to their conflicts and a growth in their relationship and personal development.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the analysis, Jack's condition throughout the story experiences two cycles of downturn and recovery. Initially, he faces a setback with the apartment dispute, recovers somewhat by finding a temporary living arrangement, then faces another significant challenge with Eric's eviction notice, and finally recovers and grows through their joint success and deepened friendship. This pattern aligns with the **Double Man in a Hole** story arc, where the protagonist faces two cycles of dilemma and recovery, ultimately ending in a better state than at the beginning.\n\n### 4.

It symbolizes Michael finding comfort, connection, and possibly a new perspective on life and relationships, marking an improvement in his emotional and personal state.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc of Michael's journey can be seen as starting from a point of displacement and uncertainty, hitting a low point with the revelation about David's actions, and then gradually improving as Michael reflects on his life, reconnects with his desires and emotions through his interactions with Tomer and others, and finally finds a sense of connection and new possibility. This pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (or a \"hole\") and then finds a way out, ending in a better state than when he started.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe story seems to focus on two main characters, Max Stevenson and Nicole Matthews, but for the purpose of analyzing the story arc, we can consider Max as the primary protagonist due to his introverted nature and social anxiety providing a clearer character development arc.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. Max adopts a dog, Chloe, to help him interact with people (sentence 3).\n2. Max and Nicole meet up in the park after matching on Bumble, resulting in a disastrous first date (sentence 13).\n3. Despite their initial dislike, they are forced to co-parent their dogs after Channing gets Chloe pregnant (sentence 18).\n4. Max and Nicole start to bond over their shared responsibility for the dogs and begin to understand each other better, leading to a spontaneous kiss from Max (sentence 24).\n5. After several ups and downs, including fights and apologies, Max and Nicole come together, and she gets accepted into an art program, symbolizing a positive change in their lives (sentence 36).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Max adopts Chloe):** Max's state is one of social isolation and anxiety. Adopting Chloe is an attempt to improve his social interactions, indicating a desire for change but still being in a disadvantaged situation.\n- **Event 2 (Disastrous first date):** Max's state worsens as his attempt at social interaction ends in disaster, reinforcing his feelings of inadequacy and anxiety.\n- **Event 3 (Co-parenting):** Max's state begins to improve as he is forced into a situation where he must interact with Nicole, despite their initial dislike. This shared responsibility starts to bring them together, slightly improving Max's social anxiety.\n- **Event 4 (Bonding and the kiss):** Max's state improves significantly as he starts to open up and connect with Nicole on a deeper level. The spontaneous kiss, although not reciprocated at first, shows a breakthrough in Max's emotional barriers.\n- **Event 5 (Acceptance into art program):** Max's state, and by extension Nicole's, reaches a high point. They have overcome their differences and are in a relationship, with Nicole also achieving a personal goal, indicating a much better situation than at the start.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the progression of Max's state throughout the story, we can observe that he starts in a disadvantaged situation (social anxiety and isolation), faces setbacks (the disastrous date), but then experiences improvement as he is forced into co-parenting and eventually bonds with Nicole. The story ends on a high note with both characters achieving personal growth and success. This pattern aligns with a story arc where the protagonist rises to a higher state after facing setbacks, which is characteristic of the **Cinderella** story arc type. The **Cinderella** arc involves a protagonist who starts in a poor state, faces challenges, but ultimately achieves a happy ending, which matches the narrative of Max and Nicole's story.\n\n### 4.

His condition rises due to the progress in his investigation and the personal connection he forms.\n- **Event 4 (Confronting Danger and Unmasking Rumors)**: Ray's state is marked by significant risk and tension.

        "output": "To analyze the story arc, we first need to identify the protagonist. In this complex narrative with multiple characters, the figure who undergoes the most significant transformation and whose story can be traced throughout is Alana Hart, the owner of the Four Horse Casino. She is involved from the beginning to the end, and her actions and decisions drive much of the plot.\n\n### 1. Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\n\n- **Protagonist:** Alana Hart\n- **5 Major Events:**\n  1. Alana kills the investigative reporter after the reporter refuses a $2 million offer to sign a non-disclosure agreement. (Sentence 2)\n  2. Johnny and Clyde rob one of the casino's armored cars, indicating a significant threat to Alana's operations. (Sentence 6)\n  3. Alana has the Elder of the cult perform a ritual to empower her to control Bakwas, showing her willingness to use extreme measures to protect her interests. (Sentence 11)\n  4. It is revealed that Alana has moved all the money and is preparing to leave town, suggesting she is securing her position despite the chaos. (Sentence 20)\n  5. Bakwas kills Alana after she gives the mystical stone to Guy, marking the end of her story. (Sentence 29)\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1:** Alana's state is one of power and control, as evidenced by her ability to silence the reporter. Her condition hasn't changed significantly at this point, as she is already in a position of authority.\n- **Event 2:** The robbery indicates a challenge to Alana's control and wealth, potentially weakening her position. However, she still holds significant power and is taking steps to protect herself.\n- **Event 3:** Alana's decision to use the ritual to control Bakwas shows she is taking drastic measures to secure her interests, possibly indicating a peak in her power or desperation, depending on the perspective.\n- **Event 4:** By moving all the money and preparing to leave, Alana seems to be securing her wealth and position, suggesting a recovery or maintenance of her high status.\n- **Event 5:** Alana's death at the hands of Bakwas marks a drastic downfall from her previous state of power and control.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the progression of Alana's condition from a high point of power and control, through challenges and attempts to secure her position, and ultimately to a drastic downfall with her death, this story fits the **Riches to Rags** arc. Alana starts in a high-status position as the casino owner, faces threats to her power and wealth, and ends in a significantly lower state, death, which is the ultimate downfall.\n\n### 4.

She faces setbacks and dilemmas, particularly with the strain in her relationship with Tom and the loss of the pro bono case. However, she consistently works towards her goals, and her condition improves significantly with her becoming an attorney and later achieving a legal victory with Tom. This pattern shows a protagonist who faces challenges, falls into difficult situations, but ultimately rises to a better state than where she started.\n\nGiven the description of story arcs:\n- **Rags to Riches** involves a protagonist starting in a disadvantaged situation and ending in a much better one, with their condition improving from the start to the end.\n- **Man in a Hole** involves a protagonist falling into a dilemma and finding a way out, ending better than at the beginning.\n- **Cinderella** involves a protagonist rising, facing a setback, and ultimately achieving a higher state.\n\nLiza's journey fits best with the **Cinderella** story arc type because she rises through her hard work and determination, faces significant setbacks (the strained relationship and the loss of the case), and ultimately achieves a higher state (becoming a successful attorney and reconciling with Tom).\n\n### 4.

Ethan attacks Cherie after she spends the evening with him, leading to her fleeing for her life (sentence 10).\n3. Cherie discovers that Ethan is a fallen angel who has been controlling men throughout history and that she is part of a larger plan to stop him (sentences 38-40).\n4. Cherie agrees to be used as bait to lure Ethan out so that he can be defeated, leading to a final confrontation (sentences 40-43).\n5. Cherie and the women from the spa defeat Ethan by exposing him to sunlight and then killing him (sentences 44-47).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: At the beginning, Cherie is in a somewhat stable but possibly unfulfilling situation, working as a secretary and being a single mother. Her decision to go to dinner with Ethan sets off a chain of events that will significantly alter her life.\n- **Event 2**: After Ethan's attack, Cherie's state worsens dramatically. She is frightened, injured, and on the run, indicating a sharp decline in her condition from the initial event.\n- **Event 3**: When Cherie learns about Ethan's true nature, her state could be seen as one of knowledge acquisition but still under threat. She understands the danger she's in but also starts to see a way out with the help of Dinah and the other women.\n- **Event 4**: Cherie's decision to be used as bait shows a shift towards empowerment and proactivity. Despite the danger, she is taking steps to confront her attacker and regain control of her life, indicating an improvement in her state.\n- **Event 5**: Finally, with Ethan's defeat, Cherie's state improves significantly. She has overcome her attacker, found support and allies, and can return to her life with a sense of victory and safety.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the progression of Cherie's state throughout the story, it starts with her in a relatively stable but unfulfilling situation, then sharply declines as she faces danger and attack, followed by a period of recovery and empowerment as she learns more about her attacker and decides to take action. This culminates in her ultimate victory over Ethan, which significantly improves her condition from where she started.\n\nThe story arc that best fits this description is the \"Man in a Hole\" arc. This arc is characterized by the protagonist falling into a dilemma (Cherie being attacked and pursued by Ethan) and then finding a way out, ultimately ending in a better state than at the beginning (Cherie defeating Ethan and securing her safety).\n\n### 4.

Jane and Ben's successful disposal of the stolen opioids and Jane's subsequent establishment of a support group for ex-military personnel.\n\n### 2. Description of Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1:** Jane is introduced with a mix of positive attributes (courageous, retired Army healthcare professional) and a negative aspect (struggling with opioid addiction). Her state is complex, with a professional facade hiding personal struggles.\n- **Event 2:** Jane's state worsens as her secret is discovered by Ben. She is forced to confront the potential consequences of her actions, including the loss of her professional reputation and personal stability.\n- **Event 3:** By confessing to Ben, Jane takes a risk that could lead to further downfall but also opens the possibility for redemption and trust. Her state is one of vulnerability and hope for understanding.\n- **Event 4:** The threat of the federal inspection escalates Jane's situation, placing her at a high risk of exposure and severe consequences. Her state is one of heightened anxiety and desperation.\n- **Event 5:** After successfully disposing of the stolen opioids and starting a support group, Jane's state improves significantly. She has found a path towards redemption, helping others with similar struggles, and has formed a meaningful bond with Ben. Her condition is better than at the beginning, as she has overcome her addiction and found a new purpose.\n\n### 3. Classification of Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, the narrative follows a pattern where Jane faces a dilemma (opioid addiction and the risk of being exposed), falls into a deeper hole (discovery by Ben and the threat of inspection), but then finds a way out through confession, redemption, and ultimately, a positive transformation (establishing a support group and overcoming her addiction). This pattern aligns with the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist's condition improves from the first turning point to the last turning point, moving from a state of struggle and danger to one of redemption and improvement.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Jill Adams, a former U.S. Army medic and recovering addict who works as a security guard at a local college.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. The car accident that leads to Matilda's temporary death and revival (sentence 3).\n2. The discovery that people are no longer able to fall asleep, and the exception of an old woman being studied at The Hub (sentences 7-9).\n3. Jill finding Matilda at church, where the churchgoers want to sacrifice her, and their subsequent escape (sentence 11).\n4. The revelation at The Hub that there is no cure for the sleep disorder and the decision to study Matilda because she can sleep (sentences 18-21).\n5. The final rescue of Matilda, the death and revival of Noah, and ultimately Jill's own drowning and revival (sentences 30-36).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **First Event (Car Accident):** Jill's state changes from a struggling single mother and addict to someone facing a life-threatening crisis with her children. Her condition worsens as she fears for her children's lives.\n\n2. **Second Event (Discovery of Sleep Disorder):** Jill's state becomes one of desperation and concern for her family's well-being as they, like everyone else, cannot sleep. Her condition worsens due to the sleep deprivation and the chaos it causes.\n\n3. **Third Event (Escape from Church):** Jill's state improves slightly as she manages to rescue Matilda from the churchgoers, showing her ability to protect her family in extreme situations. However, the overall danger and uncertainty of their situation keep her condition precarious.\n\n4. **Fourth Event (Revelation at The Hub):** Jill's state worsens as she learns there is no cure for the sleep disorder, and she sees the desperation and cruelty that humanity is capable of in the face of disaster. The decision to study Matilda puts Jill in a position of helplessness and fear for her daughter's safety.\n\n5. **Fifth Event (Final Rescue and Revival):** Jill's state reaches its lowest point physically and emotionally as she is exhausted, experiences delirium, and faces the loss of her son. However, with Matilda's realization that dying temporarily might allow them to sleep, and after Jill's own drowning and revival, Jill's condition improves dramatically as she is given a second chance at life and the possibility of sleeping again.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc of Jill Adams can be classified by examining the changes in her condition throughout the narrative. Initially, Jill faces significant challenges as a recovering addict and a single mother, indicating a low starting point. The car accident and the subsequent sleep disorder affecting everyone push her into an even more desperate situation, marking a further decline. However, her ability to protect her family and navigate the dangerous new world shows moments of improvement, albeit temporary. The revelation of no cure and the dangers at The Hub plunge her into deeper distress. Finally, the rescue of her children and her own revival offer a significant improvement in her condition, especially considering the possibility of regaining the ability to sleep.\n\nGiven these fluctuations, where Jill faces multiple dilemmas (the accident, the sleep disorder, the threat to Matilda, and her own physical and emotional exhaustion) and then finds a way out of these crises (rescuing Matilda, the potential cure through temporary death), the story best fits the \"Double Man in a Hole\" arc. This classification is due to the protagonist experiencing two significant cycles of falling into a dilemma and then recovering, with each cycle representing a major challenge and subsequent escape or improvement.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Jake Patterson.

Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1 (Jake's decision to reconnect with his past):** Jake is in a state of internal restlessness, grappling with turning fifty and still nurturing feelings for his ex-wife. His decision marks a shift from passive longing to active pursuit of reconnection.\n- **Event 2 (Chance encounter at 'The Roasted Bean'):** Jake's state improves as he rekindles emotions and memories with Rebecca, indicating a potential for positive change in his life.\n- **Event 3 (Discovery of Richard's illicit activities):** Jake's state becomes one of anxiety and determination. He is driven by a desire to protect Rebecca, which complicates his life but also gives him a sense of purpose.\n- **Event 4 (Violent confrontation and revelation):** Jake faces physical harm and emotional distress but remains resolute in his mission to save Rebecca. This event marks a low point in his physical state but a high point in his determination and moral courage.\n- **Event 5 (Final resolution and reunion):** Jake's state improves significantly as he and Rebecca reunite. Despite the physical and emotional turmoil he has faced, he ends up in a better emotional state than at the beginning of the story, having successfully protected Rebecca and rekindled their relationship.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the progression of Jake's state throughout the story, it's clear that he starts in a disadvantaged situation (emotionally restless, longing for his past) and ends in a much better one (reunited with Rebecca, having found a new purpose and overcome significant challenges). The story arc is characterized by Jake falling into a dilemma (discovering Richard's true nature and deciding to act), finding a way out (confronting Richard and revealing the truth to Rebecca), and ending up in a better state than where he started. This pattern suggests a \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, as Jake faces a significant problem, works through it, and emerges in a superior state.\n\nHowever, considering the specific events and the overall trajectory of Jake's journey, from a state of longing and restlessness to one of action, danger, and ultimately reunion and hope, the story more closely aligns with the **Rags to Riches** arc. Jake's condition improves from the first turning point to the last, as he moves from a place of personal stagnation and heartache to one of resolution, bravery, and renewed love.\n\n### 4.

This is a low point for her.\n- By Event 9-10, Rachel's state worsens as she encounters Tom and his violent intentions, introducing fear and danger into her life.\n- At Events 18-20, Rachel's state is desperate and terrified as Tom's actions escalate, and she is forced to make an impossible choice.\n- During Events 23-30, Rachel's state is one of extreme distress and panic as Tom's threats become more personal and violent, targeting her loved ones.\n- By Events 38-39, Rachel's state is one of determination and desperation to protect her son, leading to a final confrontation with Tom.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the story. Initially, Rachel is in a difficult situation (facing divorce, getting fired), which worsens as she encounters Tom and his violent stalking. However, she does not start in a completely helpless state; she has a support system (like Andy) and is trying to navigate her life challenges. As the story progresses, Rachel faces a series of escalating dilemmas and dangers (the \"hole\" she falls into), but she ultimately finds a way out by killing Tom and saving her son. This indicates that her condition improves from the lowest point (when Tom is actively threatening her and her son) to the end of the story, where she has overcome the immediate danger and is on the path to recovery.\n\nThe story does not follow a \"Rags to Riches\" arc because Rachel does not move from a disadvantaged situation to a significantly better one in terms of wealth or status. It's not \"Riches to Rags\" because she doesn't start in a high-status position only to lose it. The \"Icarus\" arc doesn't fit because Rachel doesn't rise to a peak of success before falling; instead, she faces a series of challenges from the start. The \"Cinderella\" and \"Oedipus\" arcs also don't apply because Rachel's story doesn't follow the specific patterns of rising to a higher state only to face a setback before ultimately achieving success, or starting high, falling, recovering, and then facing another significant downfall.\n\nThe \"Double Man in a Hole\" could be considered if Rachel faced two distinct cycles of falling into a dilemma and recovering, but the story more closely follows a single, intense cycle of descent into danger and eventual escape.\n\nGiven the analysis, the story best fits the \"Man in a Hole\" arc because Rachel falls into a deep dilemma (the \"hole\") as Tom's actions escalate, but she ultimately finds a way out of this dangerous situation, ending in a better state than when she was at her lowest point, facing immediate danger to herself and her son.\n\n### 4.

named Fern.\n2) Amongst her oppressed subjects, is a hardened citizen, called John Walker, who has managed to earn the respect and admiration of his peers through his skilled and aided combat maneuvers as a fighter pilot, navigating the deadly \"Eagle Strike\" fighter aircraft.\n3) Fern, in a desperate bid to assert her ruthless control over her subjects, malevolently kidnaps Sarah, John's beloved wife.\n4) Using her terrifying and highly advanced time-travel machine, which is dubbed as TimeShift, Fern sends Sarah back to the relatively peaceful year of 2018.\n5) Grief-stricken, outraged, yet determined, John hatches a bold plan to save his wife.\n6) He accomplishes an almost impossible feat by covertly stealing another TimeShift device hidden within Fern's heavily guarded fortress.\n7) With a tangible aura of steadfast determination surrounding him, John activates the TimeShift machine, bracing himself to travel back to the year 2018, in a time when the world had not yet withered under the weight of an apocalypse.\n8) His mission is clear - to find and rescue his wife, Sarah from Fern's clutches.\n9) As he steps out of the TimeShift, John is confronted with the stark contrast of a bustling, brightly lit world of 2018, a far cry from his desolate and authoritarian hometown.\n10) This transition into a foreign past overwhelms him, leaving him with a potent taste of temporal culture shock.\n11) Fern's futuristic soldiers, donning their eerie mechanical gear, are tenaciously on his tail, hellbent on capturing him and dismantling his rescue mission.\n12) Battling extreme odds, John finds an unexpected ally in Jim, an eccentric yet disgraced scientist.\n13) Known for his extraordinary theories about time travel, Jim's eccentricities now finally find a purpose.\n14) Both John and Jim, operating independently but collaboratively, navigate the various technical intricacies of TimeShift, evading Fern's ruthless soldiers and staying alive in the process.\n15) Fern, realizing her regular soldiers cannot capture John, decides to set her most fearsome and menacing soldier, Gage, after John.\n16) Equipped with cybernetic enhancements and an unrelenting resolve, Gage is Fern's secret weapon.\n17) Gage's mission is singular — to hunt down and capture John, thereby preventing him from rescuing Sarah and destabilizing Fern's reign.\n18) John, channeling his extensive knowledge of navigating complex terrains from his fighter-pilot days, masterfully eludes his steely cybernetic antagonist, Gage.\n19) His relentless pursuit for his wife ends when he stumbles upon the hidden house where Sarah has been kept.\n20) However, his momentary relief and joy is marred by an unanticipated attack.\n21) As he steps into what seems like an abandoned house, Gage suddenly materializes and assaults him in a well-orchestrated surprise attack.\n22) Unfazed and unyielding, John and Jim strategize and execute a cunning countermeasure against Gage.\n23) The duo, though heavily outnumbered, execute their plan, creating chaos and confusion amongst Fern's troops, allowing them to finally rescue Sarah.\n24) Amidst the high-adrenaline escape, Gage sabotages the TimeShift machine, triggering a self-destruct sequence, painting a grim possibility of a large scale destruction.\n25) Unfazed by the potential disaster at hand, John decides to risk the use of the malfunctioning TimeShift, hoping against hope that it will transport them back to their dystopian world of 2050.\n26) As the countdown draws to its close, John, Sarah, and Jim brace themselves, disregarding sparking cables and failing machinery around them.\n27) They risk a jump back to their dystopian future.\n28) Against all odds, they succeed in their escape and find themselves back in the bleak world of 2050, in the heart of Fern's oppressive regime.\n29) Their miraculous escape, however, isn't the only cause for elation.\n30) They bring back with them digital proof of Fern's inhumane treatment of her citizens, discovered tucked away in Sarah's place of confinement.\n31) This irrefutable evidence of Fern's brutality serves as a beacon for the oppressed citizens, igniting rage and rebellion amongst the masses.\n32) Encouraged by the newfound condemnation of Fern amongst the people, John and Sarah take it upon themselves to lead a revolt against Fern.\n33) Bearing witness to her ruthless tactics and suppression firsthand, they resolve to dismantle Fern's regime for once and for all.\n34) Relying on his status, leadership abilities, and the newly discovered evidence, John rallies his oppressed peers, encouraging them to fight back against Fern.\n35) Sarah, displaying courage and resilience, stands shoulder to shoulder with John, pledging to bring Fern's oppressive rule to an end.\n36) Inspired by John's exemplary courage and Sarah's unyielding spirit, the oppressed citizens rally together in support, galvanizing the beginnings of an impending rebellion.\n37) Fueled by this newfound sense of hope, they vow to reclaim their world from Fern's merciless rule.\n38) Meanwhile, John's act of defiance begins to create ripples amongst the populace, painting him as a symbol of courage and resilience.\n39) News of his escape and subsequent rallying cry inspires the masses, becoming a beacon of defiance against Fern's authoritarian rule.\n40) Although in its infancy, John's resistance movement begins to sway public sentiment against Fern, hinting at a possible shift in power dynamics.\n41) Fern's once solid stranglehold on the citizens now begins to show signs of crumbling as the rebellion gains momentum.\n42) As the threat of a full-scale uprising looms, John, Sarah, and the emerging resistance prepare themselves for the battles to come.\n43) The movie edges towards its climatic sequence with the anticipation of a massive uprising against Fern's regime.\n44) As the credits begin to roll, the film ends on a highly suspenseful note, promising an epic sequel titled, 'The Walker Chronojump: Rebellion'.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better (e.g., 0→1→2→4→10)\n-

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is John Walker, a hardened citizen and skilled fighter pilot living in a post-apocalyptic world under the totalitarian rule of Fern.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. Fern kidnaps John's wife, Sarah, and sends her back to 2018 using the TimeShift machine (Event 3).\n2. John steals a TimeShift device and travels back to 2018 to rescue Sarah (Event 6-7).\n3. John and his ally, Jim, successfully rescue Sarah from Fern's clutches in 2018 (Event 23).\n4. John, Sarah, and Jim return to their dystopian future, bringing with them evidence of Fern's brutality (Event 25-28).\n5. John and Sarah lead a revolt against Fern, inspiring the oppressed citizens to fight back (Event 32-42).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Fern kidnaps Sarah):** John's state is one of grief and outrage. His condition worsens significantly as he loses his beloved wife to Fern's cruelty.\n- **Event 2 (John travels back to 2018):** John's state is determined and risky. He takes a significant gamble by stealing the TimeShift device and traveling back in time. His condition improves slightly as he takes action towards rescuing Sarah.\n- **Event 3 (Successful rescue of Sarah):** John's state is relieved and triumphant. He has overcome significant odds to rescue his wife, improving his condition.\n- **Event 4 (Return to the dystopian future):** John's state is hopeful but risky. He and his companions face danger as they return to their own time with evidence to challenge Fern's rule. This event maintains a level of risk but also offers a glimmer of hope for change.\n- **Event 5 (Leading the revolt):** John's state is empowering and courageous. He transitions from being an individual acting against the regime to a leader of a movement, significantly improving his condition as he inspires and leads others to fight for their freedom.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nAnalyzing John's condition throughout these events:\n- He starts in a disadvantaged situation (living under oppression, then losing his wife).\n- He falls into a deeper dilemma (having to travel back in time, facing numerous dangers).\n- He finds a way out of this dilemma by rescuing his wife and returning to his time.\n- He ends in a better situation than where he started, as he not only rescues his wife but also becomes a leader in the revolt against Fern, improving the condition of himself and potentially the entire society.\n\nThis pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist faces significant challenges, overcomes them, and ends in a better state than where he began. The initial fall into a dilemma (loss of his wife and the risks of time travel) followed by a recovery (rescuing his wife and returning) and then moving into an even better state (leading a revolt) aligns with the characteristics of a specific story arc.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To classify the story arc type, let's first identify the protagonist and 5 major events in the story.\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Adam Reed, specifically focusing on his journey across different timelines.\n\nHere are 5 major events in the story:\n\n1. Adam steals a time jet to escape to 2018 to save his wife, Laura, but gets injured and crash-lands in 2022 (sentences 1-2).\n2. The younger Adam discovers the injured future Adam and, after initial distrust, realizes the stranger is his future self (sentences 3-6).\n3. Adam and his younger self, along with Laura, learn about Maya Sorian's monopolization of time travel and her attempts to kill Laura to protect her secret (sentences 8-12).\n4. The Adams and Laura attempt to destroy the time travel machine, but Sorian captures the younger Adam, leading to a confrontation (sentences 17-22).\n5. The Reeds manage to outsmart Sorian, causing her to shoot her past self, which erases the dystopian future, and the story concludes with Adam returning to his time, living in a new, improved timeline (sentences 23-28).\n\nNow, let's analyze the protagonist's state at each event and how it changes:\n\n- At event 1, Adam is in a desperate state, trying to escape his dystopian future to save his wife. His condition is low due to his injuries and the failure of his initial plan.\n- At event 2, Adam's younger self is initially in a state of confusion and distrust but then transitions into understanding and alliance with his future self. This marks a slight improvement in the protagonist's overall state as he gains an ally and potential hope for changing his situation.\n- At event 3, Adam and his younger self, along with Laura, gain crucial information about their enemy and the reason behind the attempts on their lives. This knowledge empowers them, slightly improving their condition as they now have a clearer understanding of what they are up against and can plan accordingly.\n- At event 4, the protagonist faces a significant setback as Sorian captures the younger Adam, putting him in a more dangerous and desperate situation than before. This is a clear downturn in Adam's condition.\n- At event 5, Adam and his allies successfully outmaneuver Sorian, leading to the eradication of the dystopian future. This results in Adam ending up in a much better situation than where he started, living in a new timeline where he has let go of his past anger and is reunited with his family in a positive way.\n\nGiven this analysis, the story arc type can be classified based on the protagonist starting in a difficult situation, facing challenges and setbacks, but ultimately ending in a significantly better state. This pattern matches the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma but finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning.\n\nMan in a Hole"

        "output": "### TASK 1: Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\n\nThe protagonists in the story are Jerry and Hassan, two top-tier students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The 5 major events in the story can be identified as follows:\n\n1. **Decision to Embark on the Mythical Expedition**: Jerry and Hassan decide to take on the \"Mythical Expedition,\" a test of mental agility and strategic acumen, after discovering its details ( Sentence 4).\n2. **Inciting a Feud**: During their expedition, they unintentionally reignite a dormant feud between the Beta Xi sorority and a rival sorority house, leading to a heated confrontation (Sentence 9).\n3. **Confrontation and Retreat**: The situation escalates, and MIT security intervenes, forcing Jerry and Hassan to retreat and reflect on their actions (Sentence 11).\n4. **Renewed Determination**: After a deep reflection and with the encouragement of Claire from the Beta Xi house, Jerry and Hassan decide to continue their quest but with a more refined sense of empathy and compassion (Sentence 15).\n5. **Successful Completion of the Expedition**: Jerry and Hassan successfully complete the Mythical Expedition, mediating the dispute between the rival groups, and are celebrated by the MIT community (Sentence 21).\n\n### TASK 2: Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1 (Decision to Embark)**: Jerry and Hassan are in a state of excitement and anticipation, eager to take on the challenge. Their condition is positive, filled with confidence and curiosity.\n- **Event 2 (Inciting a Feud)**: The protagonists' state shifts to one of surprise and concern as they realize the unintended consequences of their actions. Their condition worsens as they face conflict and opposition.\n- **Event 3 (Confrontation and Retreat)**: Jerry and Hassan's state is one of defeat and reflection. They are forced to reevaluate their approach and consider the impact of their actions. Their condition is at a low point, marked by failure and uncertainty.\n- **Event 4 (Renewed Determination)**: With Claire's encouragement, the protagonists' state improves as they regain confidence and develop a new strategy that incorporates empathy and compassion. Their condition begins to ascend as they prepare to rectify their mistake.\n- **Event 5 (Successful Completion)**: Jerry and Hassan's state is one of triumph and fulfillment. They successfully complete the expedition, having learned valuable lessons about unity, empathy, and the importance of considering the consequences of their actions. Their condition peaks at this point, with their reputation and influence among their peers significantly enhanced.\n\n### TASK 3: Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the description of the protagonists' state and how it changes throughout the story, the narrative follows a pattern where Jerry and Hassan initially face a challenge (the expedition), then experience a downfall (inciting a feud and confrontation), followed by a period of reflection and growth (renewed determination with empathy and compassion), and finally achieve a triumphant outcome (successful completion of the expedition). This pattern aligns with the **Man in a Hole** story arc type, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma but finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning. The key elements of this arc are the initial fall into a problem (the feud), the hitting of a low point (retreat and reflection), and the subsequent rise to a successful conclusion (completing the expedition and fostering unity).\n\n### TASK 4: Determined Story Arc Type\n\nMan in a Hole"

        "output": "To classify the story arc of the given narrative, let's first identify the protagonist and key events, then analyze the protagonist's condition throughout these events.\n\n1. **Identify the protagonist and 5 major events:**\n   - The protagonists can be considered as a group, specifically Sean and Kunle, since the story revolves around their actions and decisions.\n   - 5 major events:\n     1. Discovering Emma's unconscious body and deciding not to call the police (sentences 2-3).\n     2. The incident where Kunle is chased off a party, leading to their car being damaged (sentence 7).\n     3. Emma regaining consciousness, causing a commotion, and them eventually crashing the car (sentences 11-12).\n     4. The confrontation with Maddy, Alice, and Rafael, followed by the explanation and the decision to take Emma to the hospital (sentences 14-17).\n     5. The final confrontation with the police and the resolution of the situation (sentences 20-24).\n\n2. **Describe the protagonist's state and how it changed at each event:**\n   - **Event 1:** The protagonists are in a state of panic and fear of repercussions due to racial bias, deciding to take matters into their own hands. Their condition is tense and uncertain.\n   - **Event 2:** The situation escalates, with Kunle being chased and their car damaged. This increases their stress and fear, worsening their condition.\n   - **Event 3:** The protagonists face a dangerous and chaotic situation as Emma awakens and they crash the car. This event significantly worsens their condition, putting them in physical danger and increasing their legal and ethical dilemmas.\n   - **Event 4:** After the confrontation and explanation, the group decides to take Emma to the hospital. This event begins to improve the protagonists' condition as they are taking a positive action towards resolving the crisis, despite the skepticism they face.\n   - **Event 5:** The final confrontation with the police is highly tense, with Kunle's life potentially at risk. However, the situation is resolved without severe legal consequences for the protagonists, and they are allowed to leave. This event marks a significant improvement in their condition, as the immediate dangers and legal threats are alleviated.\n\n3. **Classify the story arc type:**\n   - The story starts with the protagonists in a relatively normal state, preparing for the \"Legendary Tour.\" However, upon finding Emma, they fall into a dilemma (Event 1), which worsens as they try to handle the situation themselves, leading to a series of escalating problems (Events 2-3). \n   - They then begin to find a way out of their predicament by making a decision to take Emma to the hospital (Event 4), which is a turning point towards improving their situation.\n   - Finally, they face a last, intense confrontation but manage to come out of it without severe consequences (Event 5), ending in a better state than they were in during the height of the crisis.\n   - This pattern of falling into a dilemma, hitting a low point, and then finding a way out to end up in a better or at least safer situation aligns with the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc.\n\n4. **Determined story arc type:**\nMan in a Hole"

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story can be considered as both Kate and John, as the narrative focuses on their relationship and individual developments. However, for the purpose of analyzing the story arc, we can consider Kate as the primary protagonist, given her significant character development and the emotional journey she undertakes.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. **Kate's decision to leave her marketing job on Wall Street to support John's new role at Yale University.** (Event related to sentence 8)\n2. **Kate starts feeling the erosion of her confidence due to the solitude and mundanity of domestic chores in their new home.** (Event related to sentence 16)\n3. **Kate takes an audacious leap by applying for an MBA at Yale, marking her reentry into the academic world.** (Event related to sentence 16)\n4. **Kate's meteoric rise in academia, culminating in her being offered the position to head Yale's business department, contrasts with John's growing insecurity.** (Event related to sentences 23-28)\n5. **Kate and John have a heated confrontation, leading them to take a break and reflect on their identities, ambitions, and their fracturing bond.** (Event related to sentence 31)\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **At the first event (Kate's decision to support John),** Kate's state is one of sacrifice and support. She is leaving behind a successful career to support her husband's dreams, indicating a selfless and loving state but also potentially setting herself up for future dissatisfaction or feelings of loss.\n\n2. **At the second event (feeling the erosion of confidence),** Kate's state has changed to one of doubt and insecurity. She is struggling to find meaning and purpose in her new life, away from her professional identity.\n\n3. **At the third event (applying for an MBA),** Kate's state shifts towards empowerment and determination. She is taking proactive steps to redefine her life and find a new sense of purpose, showing a strong and ambitious side.\n\n4. **At the fourth event (meteoric rise in academia),** Kate's state is one of success and recognition. She is thriving in her new academic environment and gaining respect and admiration from her peers, which contrasts with her initial feelings of insecurity and doubt.\n\n5. **At the fifth event (heated confrontation and taking a break),** Kate's state, along with John's, is one of turmoil and introspection. They are both forced to confront the consequences of their actions and the changes in their relationship, marking a low point in their partnership.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the fluctuations in Kate's state throughout the story, from sacrifice and support, through doubt and insecurity, to empowerment and success, and finally to turmoil and introspection before resolution, the story arc does not follow a simple linear progression. Instead, it involves cycles of dilemma and recovery, particularly as both characters face challenges, individually and together, and work towards overcoming them.\n\nThe story initially seems to follow a **Rags to Riches** arc for Kate, as she moves from a state of doubt and insecurity to one of success and recognition. However, the introduction of conflict and the downward spiral in their relationship, followed by a period of reflection and eventual reconciliation, suggests a more complex narrative.\n\nConsidering the dual nature of the protagonists' journeys and the cycles of challenge and recovery they both undergo, the story can be classified under a specific story arc type that accommodates these dynamics.\n\n### 4. Determined Story Arc Type\n\nDouble Man in a Hole"

Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **At Event 1**, Rose's state is one of innocence and naivety, moving into a new environment with her husband. Her condition is relatively high, filled with hope and anticipation for their new life.\n- **At Event 2**, Rose's state changes as she becomes more entrenched in the Jackson-Hyman household dynamics. She is both fascinated and manipulated by Shirley, leading to a complex emotional state. Her condition could be seen as slightly lower due to the loss of autonomy and the influence of Shirley's behavior.\n- **At Event 3**, Rose's state plummets upon discovering her husband's infidelity. This revelation leads to a crisis, making her question her marriage, her role in the household, and her own identity. Her condition is significantly lower.\n- **At Event 4**, Rose reaches a critical low point, contemplating suicide. However, her decision not to jump marks a beginning of her recovery and realization of her own strength and desire for change. Her condition starts to improve from this point.\n- **At Event 5**, Rose's state has improved significantly. She has confronted her situation, made a decision to change her life, and is leaving the toxic environment behind. Her condition is higher than at the previous event, indicating growth and empowerment.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the changes in Rose's condition throughout the story, it seems the story arc does not fit perfectly into the **Riches to Rags** category as initially suggested. Instead, Rose's journey resembles more closely the **Man in a Hole** story arc. She starts in a relatively good place, falls into a series of dilemmas and challenges (including her entanglement with the Jackson-Hymans, discovery of her husband's infidelity, and contemplation of suicide), but ultimately finds a way out and ends in a better state than when she started, having gained insight, independence, and a newfound determination to change her life.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Lily, the spirited young maiden who resides in the Beacon Tower. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. The arrival of a message in a bottle revealing the King's search for his lost daughter (sentence 4).\n2. Lily discovering her true identity as the missing princess (sentence 9).\n3. Lily deciding to reveal her identity to the King and sending a response (sentence 12).\n4. The attempted abduction of Lily by the court advisor during the royal celebration (sentence 20).\n5. The final exposure of the advisor's treachery and Lily's reunion with her father, the King (sentences 24-28).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1:** At the arrival of the message, Lily's state changes from a tranquil, albeit curious, existence to one filled with curiosity and questioning about her past. Her condition is sparked with intrigue but remains relatively stable in terms of her overall well-being and knowledge about herself.\n\n- **Event 2:** Upon discovering her true identity, Lily's state shifts dramatically from being an unaware, humble ward of Benjamin to being aware of her royal lineage. This revelation brings both excitement and uncertainty, potentially improving her condition in terms of knowledge and potential future opportunities but also introducing confusion and the need for adjustment.\n\n- **Event 3:** When Lily decides to reveal her identity, her state shows courage and determination. She moves from a place of discovery to one of action, taking control of her newfound knowledge. This decision sets her on a path that could potentially lead to a better life, improving her condition from one of ignorance to one of empowerment.\n\n- **Event 4:** The attempted abduction places Lily in a state of danger and vulnerability. Her condition worsens as she faces a significant threat to her safety and well-being. This event represents a downturn in her story, where her actions and decisions lead to a risky and potentially harmful situation.\n\n- **Event 5:** Finally, with the exposure of the advisor's treachery and her reunion with the King, Lily's state improves as she finds safety, acceptance, and a sense of belonging. Her condition is better than at the beginning, as she has not only discovered her true identity but has also navigated the challenges associated with it and found a positive resolution.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, it can be observed that Lily starts in a relatively stable, albeit ignorant, state. She then experiences a rise with the discovery of her true identity and the potential it brings, followed by a setback when she faces danger and abduction. Ultimately, she achieves a higher state than where she began, with a newfound understanding of herself, a reunion with her father, and an acceptance of her royal lineage.\n\nThis pattern of rising, facing a setback, and ultimately achieving a higher state aligns with the **Cinderella** story arc type. The Cinderella arc is characterized by the protagonist's journey from a lower state to a higher one, often marked by a significant challenge or setback before achieving success or happiness. In Lily's case, her journey from an unaware, humble existence to discovering her royalty, facing danger, and then finding acceptance and reunion with her father mirrors this arc.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Nemo, a young girl who lives in a lighthouse with her widowed father. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Peter's Loss at Sea (Event 4)**: Nemo learns that her father, Peter, was lost at sea.\n2. **Introduction to Slumberland and Flip (Events 9-12)**: Nemo discovers the world of Slumberland, where she meets Flip, a character from her father's stories who is real.\n3. **The Quest for Magical Pearls (Events 13-16)**: Nemo and Flip embark on a journey to find magical wish-granting pearls, navigating through dreams and facing challenges.\n4. **Rescuing Flip and Discovering the Truth (Events 22-24)**: Nemo rescues Flip from imprisonment and reveals to him his true identity as Philip's dream alter ego.\n5. **Using the Wish to Save Flip and Reuniting with Her Father (Events 32-37)**: Nemo uses a wishing pearl to force Flip to wake up, which leads to Philip becoming emboldened in the real world, and she eventually gets to spend time with her father in Slumberland before returning to the real world.\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **At Event 1 (Peter's Loss at Sea)**: Nemo's state is one of devastation and loss. She has just learned that her father is lost at sea, which significantly worsens her condition from a stable life with her father.\n- **At Event 2 (Introduction to Slumberland and Flip)**: Nemo's state begins to show signs of hope and adventure. She discovers a new world and a friend, which slightly improves her condition, offering her a distraction and a new goal.\n- **At Event 3 (The Quest for Magical Pearls)**: Nemo's state is one of determination and risk. She is on a quest, facing challenges, which keeps her condition dynamic but with an upward trend as she finds purpose.\n- **At Event 4 (Rescuing Flip and Discovering the Truth)**: Nemo's state becomes more complex, as she deals with the reality of Flip's identity and his reluctance to wake up. This event presents a setback in her emotional journey, as she faces the harsh truth about her uncle and his connection to Flip.\n- **At Event 5 (Using the Wish to Save Flip and Reuniting with Her Father)**: Nemo's state improves significantly. She successfully uses a wish to save Flip, which in turn transforms her uncle Philip, and she gets to reunite with her father, albeit briefly. This event marks a significant improvement in her condition, as she finds closure, improves her relationship with her uncle, and begins to heal.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the story. Nemo starts in a relatively stable condition, faces a significant downfall with her father's loss, then embarks on a journey of discovery and adventure in Slumberland. She faces setbacks, such as learning the truth about Flip and dealing with the challenges of her quest, but ultimately ends in a better state than where she began. She rescues Flip, transforms her uncle, reunites with her father (even if briefly), and starts to rebuild her life in the real world.\n\nThis pattern of falling into a dilemma (her father's loss and her subsequent struggles), finding a way out through her adventures in Slumberland, and ending in a better state than at the beginning aligns with the **Double Man in a Hole** story arc type, as it involves cycles of dilemma and recovery. However, a closer examination reveals that while Nemo does face two significant challenges (her father's loss and the complexities of Flip's identity and her quest), her overall journey is more accurately described by a pattern of initial loss, followed by a rise through her adventures and discoveries, and ultimately achieving a higher state of being through her bravery and the resolution of her uncle's internal conflict.\n\n### 4.

Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Biscuit, a 15-year-old boy who is significantly heavier than his peers and faces bullying and social isolation because of his weight.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. Biscuit's introduction and his life in Riverdale, marked by bullying and retreat into a digital world.\n2. The arrival of the Watsons and Biscuit's encounter with Leah, which sparks a friendship.\n3. Leah shares her personal journey of overcoming obesity, inspiring Biscuit to address his weight issues.\n4.

Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Biscuit is in a state of distress, facing bullying, and has low self-esteem. He finds solace in his digital world.\n- **Event 2**: With Leah's friendship, Biscuit starts to come out of his shell. His state improves slightly as he finds a supportive friend, but he still hasn't addressed his weight issues.\n- **Event 3**: After Leah shares her story, Biscuit becomes inspired to change. This marks a significant turning point where his mindset starts to shift towards positivity and the desire for change.\n- **Event 4**: Biscuit decides to take action by participating in the fitness challenge.

This trajectory aligns with the **Rags to Riches** story arc type, where the protagonist's condition improves significantly from the beginning to the end of the story. The key elements that support this classification are the clear starting point of disadvantage, the turning points that inspire and facilitate change (Leah's friendship and her story of overcoming obesity), and the culmination of these efforts in a successful transformation.\n\n### 4.

Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1:** At this point, Butter is at a low state, feeling suicidal and desperate for attention and acceptance. His decision to stream his eating to death is a cry for help and a manifestation of his deep-seated issues with self-worth and bullying.\n- **Event 2:** Here, Butter's state improves significantly. He finds acceptance and friendship, which boosts his self-confidence and mental health. His appetite decreases, indicating a positive change in his physical and emotional well-being.\n- **Event 3:** This event marks a downturn for Butter. His revelation to Anna leads to rejection, which likely exacerbates his feelings of low self-worth and isolation. This setback indicates that despite recent improvements, Butter still faces significant personal challenges.\n- **Event 4:** The attempt to eat to death ending in anaphylactic shock and hospitalization is a critical low point for Butter. It physically and emotionally jeopardizes him, forcing him to confront the severity of his situation and the need for change.\n- **Event 5:** In the final major event, Butter's state improves dramatically. He seeks help through therapy, loses weight, and reconciles with Anna on a friendship level. This indicates personal growth, a healthier outlook on life, and a move towards a more positive and stable state.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be determined by analyzing the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. The protagonist starts in a disadvantaged situation (severely obese, suicidal, and bullied), experiences a rise in his condition as he finds temporary acceptance and improves his mental health, faces a significant setback with Anna's rejection and his health crisis, and ultimately ends in a better state than where he began (in therapy, reconciled with Anna, and physically healthier).\n\nThis pattern reflects a story where the protagonist rises from a low point, faces challenges and setbacks, but ultimately achieves a higher state than at the beginning. This is characteristic of the **Cinderella** story arc, where despite facing setbacks, the protagonist achieves a happier ending.\n\n### 4. Determined Story Arc Type\n\nCinderella"

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story can be considered as the twins, James and Michael, although their mother, Nicole, also undergoes significant development. For the purpose of this analysis, we will focus on the twins as the primary protagonists since the story largely follows their journey and emotional growth.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. The twins receive an urgent phone call about their father's sudden health scare (sentence 6).\n2. The twins discover a hidden box containing their mother's past (sentence 10).\n3. They confront their mother with the picture album, leading to her opening up about her past (sentence 13).\n4. The twins organize a city-wide concert to celebrate their mother's hidden talent (sentences 16-19).\n5. The successful concert where their mother performs, marking a new beginning for the family (sentences 23-26).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **Event 1 (Father's Health Scare):** The twins' state changes from a sheltered and comfortable life under their father's care to a state of uncertainty and worry. Their condition worsens as they are forced to confront the reality of their father's illness and the necessity of living with their distant mother.\n\n2. **Event 2 (Discovery of Mother's Past):** Initially, the twins are in an uncomfortable and unfamiliar environment at their mother's apartment. The discovery of the hidden box introduces curiosity and a desire to understand their mother better. Their condition starts to improve as they begin to see their mother in a different light, sparking an interest in connecting with her.\n\n3. **Event 3 (Confronting Mother with the Past):** The twins take a significant step by confronting their mother, which leads to her opening up. This event marks a turning point where the twins start to develop respect and understanding for their mother. Their condition improves further as they begin to form a bond with her.\n\n4. **Event 4 (Organizing the Concert):** The twins are now motivated and proactive, working to organize a concert for their mother. This indicates a significant improvement in their condition as they are no longer just passive recipients of their circumstances but are taking action to improve their family's situation. They are also emotionally supporting their mother, which strengthens their bond.\n\n5. **Event 5 (The Concert):** The success of the concert and the emotional connection they experience with their mother mark a peak in their journey. The twins' condition has improved dramatically from the initial point of uncertainty and distance from their mother. They have moved towards a state of unity, understanding, and emotional warmth within their family.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story follows the twins from a state of comfort and security to one of uncertainty and challenge (when their father falls ill and they have to move in with their mother), and then to a journey of discovery, connection, and ultimately, to a state of familial unity and emotional warmth. This progression indicates that the protagonists face a dilemma (living with a distant mother after their father's health scare), find a way out (by discovering and connecting with their mother's past and organizing the concert), and end up in a better state than they were initially (with a newfound respect and love for their mother and a unified family).\n\nGiven this analysis, the story arc type is best classified as a \"Man in a Hole\" because the twins fall into a difficult situation (the hole) when their father becomes ill and they must live with their mother, but through their actions and the journey of discovery, they manage to climb out of this hole and end up in a better situation than where they started, with a stronger, more loving family bond.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Elias, one of the twin brothers. Here are 5 major events in the story:\n\n1. **Discovery of the Barn**: Elias and Lukas explore the barn despite their mother's rules, leading to a confrontation (sentence 6).\n2. **Questioning Mother's Identity**: Elias discovers an old headshot of their mother with green eyes, leading him and Lukas to doubt the woman they are living with is really their mother (sentence 11).\n3. **Confrontation and Escape**: Elias attempts to remove Mother's face mask, leading to a violent confrontation, and the boys decide to escape (sentence 13).\n4. **The Truth Revealed**: Elias discovers the green contact lenses in Mother's purse, confirming her identity, and then learns the truth about Lukas's death (sentence 23 and 27).\n5. **Tragic Conclusion**: Elias pushes Mother from the barn loft, causing a fire, and then has a hallucination of Mother and Lukas comforting him (sentence 29 and 31).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Discovery of the Barn)**: Elias is curious and slightly rebellious, leading to a confrontation with Mother. His state is one of cautious defiance.\n- **Event 2 (Questioning Mother's Identity)**: Elias becomes suspicious and uneasy about Mother's true identity, indicating a state of confusion and distrust.\n- **Event 3 (Confrontation and Escape)**: Elias is terrified and desperate, leading to a decision to escape, showing a state of fear and desperation.\n- **Event 4 (The Truth Revealed)**: Elias moves from confusion and distrust to a state of shock and guilt upon learning the truth about Lukas and Mother's identity.\n- **Event 5 (Tragic Conclusion)**: Elias's state deteriorates to one of grief, guilt, and confusion, leading to a tragic act against Mother, followed by a hallucinatory comfort, indicating a complex mix of emotions and psychological distress.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. Initially, Elias is in a difficult situation (returning to live with an estranged and mysterious mother), which worsens as he experiences fear, distrust, and guilt. However, there's a turning point where he seems to find some truth and potential for reconciliation (upon finding the contact lenses and learning the truth about his brother). Unfortunately, this leads to another downfall (the tragic confrontation with Mother and the fire). This pattern of starting high (in terms of emotional stability and hope for reconciliation), falling (into fear and distrust), recovering slightly (with the truth), and then facing another significant downfall (the tragic conclusion) aligns with the **Oedipus** story arc type.\n\n### 4.

Her state is one of professional curiosity and slight uncertainty.\n2. **Discovery of the supernatural entity**: After witnessing the entity, Sam's state changes to one of invigorated determination and a deeper understanding of the mystery. She is more driven to uncover the truth.\n3. **Tragic loss**: With Dr. Clayton's death, Sam's state worsens to one of grief, isolation, and increased peril. She is emotionally affected and faces greater challenges in her pursuit for justice.\n4. **Theory unveiling and bold resolution**: Despite her emotional state, Sam's determination and resolve lead her to unveil her theory and decide to face the entity. Her state is one of courage and determination in the face of adversity.\n5. **Confrontation and resolution**: After successfully negotiating with the entity and achieving her goal, Sam's state improves to one of victory and satisfaction. She has solved the case and brought an end to the bloodshed.\n\nBased on these events and the protagonist's state at each, we can see that Sam's condition:\n\n- Starts with a sense of curiosity and determination\n- Faces a significant challenge with the discovery of the supernatural entity, but her determination increases\n- Worsens with the tragic loss of Dr. Clayton\n- Improves as she finds the courage to face the entity and unveil her theory\n- Ends on a high note with her victory and the resolution of the case\n\nThis pattern indicates that the story follows a narrative where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (the investigation and its challenges) and finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning. This matches the description of the **Man in a Hole** story arc type, where the protagonist's condition improves from the first turning point to the last turning point, despite facing significant challenges and setbacks along the way.\n\nMan in a Hole"

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story can be considered as Jack Philips, as the narrative significantly focuses on his growth, challenges, and ultimate triumphs throughout the mission.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. **Introduction to NASA's Command Center**: Jack joins the elite team of \"Orbital Engineers\" with a mix of nerves and excitement (sentence 4).\n2. **The Mission Begins**: The team, including Jack, Richard, and Meg, sets forth on their mission to repair the Hubble Space Telescope aboard the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft (sentence 8).\n3. **Discovery of the Time Bomb**: The team discovers a hidden time bomb within the Hubble Space Telescope, threatening unprecedented devastation (sentence 12).\n4. **Richard's Injury and the Team's Response**: Richard sustains a crippling injury, leaving Meg and Jack to navigate the challenges of disarming the bomb and salvaging satellites (sentence 18).\n5. **Successful Disarmament of the Bomb and Aftermath**: Meg and Jack successfully disarm the bomb, rectify the satellite anomalies, but at the cost of Richard's life (sentences 25-28).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1 (Introduction to NASA's Command Center)**: Jack is nervous and excited, indicating a state of anticipation and slight insecurity about his new role. His condition is one of potential, ready to be developed.\n- **Event 2 (The Mission Begins)**: Jack is determined and ambitious, honing his skills for the mission. His state has transitioned to one of focus and preparation, indicating a positive trajectory in his development as an astronaut.\n- **Event 3 (Discovery of the Time Bomb)**: Fear is introduced, and Jack's state changes to one of alarm and urgency. This marks a downturn in his condition as the situation becomes more dire.\n- **Event 4 (Richard's Injury and the Team's Response)**: Jack faces a significant challenge with Richard's injury, requiring him to step up alongside Meg. His state is one of heightened responsibility and stress, yet he begins to show signs of growth and capability.\n- **Event 5 (Successful Disarmament of the Bomb and Aftermath)**: Despite the tragic loss of Richard, Jack emerges victorious but somber, having undergone a profound metamorphosis. His condition has improved from his initial state, as he has grown into a more capable and seasoned astronaut, ready to carry on Richard's legacy.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc can be classified based on the protagonist's (Jack) condition throughout the narrative. Initially, Jack starts in a state of potential and growth (nervous but ambitious). He faces a significant downturn with the discovery of the time bomb and the subsequent challenges, including Richard's injury. However, he recovers and grows from these challenges, ultimately ending in a better state than where he began, having successfully completed the mission and matured as an astronaut.\n\nThe narrative follows a pattern where the protagonist faces difficulties, overcomes them, and emerges in a better condition than at the start. This does not perfectly align with a single cycle of downfall and recovery (Man in a Hole) but shows elements of facing multiple challenges and growing from them.\n\nGiven the options and the pattern observed, the closest match seems to be a story arc that involves facing challenges, recovering, and ultimately achieving a higher state. However, the provided classification of \"Double Man in a Hole\" suggests a pattern of two cycles of dilemma and recovery, which can be argued as Jack faces his initial fears and the later, more significant challenges following Richard's injury, and emerges stronger each time.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To analyze the story arc, let's first identify the protagonist and major events in the story.\n\n1. **Protagonist Identification and Major Events:**\n   - The story has multiple characters, but if we focus on the ones who drive the plot forward and undergo significant changes, we can identify Brian Harper and Jo (Jocinda \"Jo\" Fowler) as central protagonists. However, for the sake of analysis, let's consider Brian Harper as the primary protagonist since his transformation and actions are pivotal to the story's progression.\n   - Five major events in the story are:\n     1. The alien swarm attack on the Space Shuttle mission (sentence 2).\n     2. Brian's return to Earth and being fired from NASA (sentence 3).\n     3. The discovery of the Moon's anomalous orbit and the global panic (sentences 5-8).\n     4. The revelation about the Moon being a Dyson sphere and the true nature of the alien swarm (sentence 17).\n     5. The final mission to correct the Moon's orbit and destroy the swarm, resulting in the Moon's power being restored (sentences 23-24).\n\n2. **Protagonist's State at Each Event:**\n   - **Event 1 (Alien Swarm Attack):** Brian's state changes from being a respected astronaut on a mission to being the sole witness of a catastrophic event, which sets him on a path of disbelief and isolation.\n   - **Event 2 (Fired from NASA):** Brian's condition worsens; he goes from being a trusted professional to being discredited and unemployed, hitting a low point in his career and personal life.\n   - **Event 3 (Discovery of the Moon's Anomalous Orbit):** Brian's state starts to improve slightly as he gets involved again with the mystery of the alien swarm, but he's still in a state of limbo, not fully redeemed or back in his professional element.\n   - **Event 4 (Revelation about the Moon):** This event marks a significant turning point for Brian as he learns the truth about the Moon and his past experiences. His condition improves as he gains a deeper understanding and purpose, moving towards redemption.\n   - **Event 5 (Final Mission):** Brian's condition improves further as he plays a crucial role in saving the Earth, redeeming himself professionally and personally, and finding closure.\n\n3. **Story Arc Classification:**\n   - The story follows a pattern where the protagonist (Brian) faces a significant downfall (being attacked and then fired), then undergoes a period of recovery and growth as he uncovers the truth and redeemed himself through his actions in the final mission.\n   - This pattern resembles the **Double Man in a Hole** story arc, where the protagonist faces two cycles of dilemma and recovery. However, upon closer inspection, it's more aligned with the **Man in a Hole** story arc, as Brian falls into a dilemma (the attack and its aftermath) and then finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning. The elements of recovery, revelation, and ultimate redemption fit this arc type.\n\n4. **Determined Story Arc Type:**\n   Man in a Hole"

the Epsilon malware was only half-implanted within the Iron Dome's mainframe.\n30) Yet, Miller's defiant spirit refuses to back down.\n31) He quickly identifies a potential oversight in the facility's security, possibly left exposed due to the half-implanted malware, presenting a small window of opportunity.\n32) However, harnessing this opportunity would require a marriage of Leyla's field knowledge and Miller's techno-wizardry.\n33) A collaboration that could either turn the tides in their favor or push them further into the abyss of failure.\n34) Act five unleashes their audacious strategy.\n35) Miller and Leyla devise a risky plan to exploit the loophole using a hijacked military vehicle which would bypass the facility's defenses and deliver the remaining Epsilon malware.\n36) Leyla pledges her support to this seemingly suicidal plan, bringing forth resources collected during her long government service in Syrian law enforcement.\n37) Their daring plan is not greeted with enthusiasm by the hierarchy at Code Delta.\n38) Miller's boss argues for the mission's elevated risk and the possible ignition of global conflict, threatening to shut down the entire operation from his secure office in Washington D.C.\n39) He stresses the potentially damaging fallout of Miller's audacity.\n40) Despite facing severe backlash and witnessing the crumbling support from his superiors, Miller and his newfound ally, Leyla, stand their ground.\n41) Act six leads Miller and Leyla down the path of rebellion.\n42) Defying the orders from their superiors, the pair rally their resources, bolster their intelligence, and launch a daring assault on the Iron Dome.\n43) Audience hearts skip a beat as Miller cautiously navigates through complex laser security, confronting cybernetically enhanced operatives tasked with halting his progress.\n44) Simultaneously, Leyla holds her own battle in a local marketplace.\n45) With swift thinking and calculated movements, she diverts attention, buying Miller crucial time for his operation.\n46) As the Act reaches its climax, in a breath-taking sequence, Miller manages to implant the remaining Epsilon malware data packet into the Dome's control room.\n47) Act VII charts the duo's dramatic escape.\n48) The implementation of Epsilon malware creates chaos inside the Iron Dome, providing Miller and Leyla the perfect smoke screen to escape the facility.\n49) Leveraging the prevailing pandemonium, the duo skillfully dodge security and make a headlong dash towards the exit, leaving behind the Dome in a cloud of impending doom.\n50) Once out of the danger zone, a bond that goes deeper than mere comradeship blossoms between Miller and Leyla.\n51) Under a star-veiled Syrian sky, Leyla assures Miller of her allegiance and promises to protect his mission from bureaucratic interference.\n52) Miller’s arrival back to Code Delta agency is severely met with outrage and disbelief from his director, furious at Miller's insubordination which put the agency at risk.\n53) Opening the final Act, we find Miller distanced from his parent agency.\n54) Alienated and unphased by the hostility from his superiors, he resolves to go lone-wolf, pledging to put his irreplaceable tech skills to use to aid those in need, globally.\n55) The movie nears its end as the concluding drone shots show Miller's silhouette dissolving into the desert horizon.\n56) Thus concludes the thrilling eight Act narrative of \"Miller's Mission\".\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better (e.g., 0→1→2→4→10)\n- Riches to Rags: Protagonist starts high and ends lower (e.g., 10→9→8→6→0)\n- Man in a Hole: Protagonist falls into trouble but recovers (e.g., 6→2→1→4→10)\n- Icarus: Protagonist rises then falls dramatically (e.g., 2→4→9→5→1)\n- Double Man in a Hole: Two cycles of fall and recovery (e.g., 6→2→7→4→10)\n- Cinderella: Rise, setback, ultimate triumph (e.g., 1→7→4→1→10)\n- Oedipus: Start high, fall, recover, final fall (e.g., 10→4→7→9→1)",
        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Agent John Miller. The 5 major events in the story are:\n- Event 1: Miller receives his mission to infiltrate the 'Iron Dome' and inject the 'Epsilon' malware (Sentence 5).\n- Event 2: Miller sets off an unanticipated infrared alarm system, complicating his mission (Sentence 17).\n- Event 3: Miller encounters Leyla, a local detective, who decides to aid him despite initial suspicions (Sentence 23).\n- Event 4: Miller and Leyla devise a plan to exploit a loophole in the Iron Dome's security to complete the mission (Sentence 35).\n- Event 5: Miller successfully implants the remaining Epsilon malware and escapes the facility with Leyla's help (Sentence 46).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: Miller's state is one of determination and focus as he embarks on a critical mission. His condition is neutral, with a clear objective ahead.\n- **Event 2**: Miller's state worsens as he faces unexpected complications, indicating a decline in his condition due to the increased risk of failure and danger.\n- **Event 3**: Miller's state improves slightly with Leyla's unexpected aid, offering a glimmer of hope and a potential turnaround in his mission.\n- **Event 4**: Miller's state is one of strategic planning and risk-taking, as he and Leyla devise a daring plan. His condition is cautiously optimistic, with a recognition of the high stakes.\n- **Event 5**: Miller's state peaks as he successfully completes his mission, despite the odds. His condition improves significantly, marking a triumph over the challenges faced.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc can be classified by analyzing the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. Initially, Miller is tasked with a challenging mission, placing him in a neutral state. As complications arise (Event 2), his state declines. However, with Leyla's help (Event 3) and their subsequent planning and execution (Events 4 and 5), Miller's state improves, culminating in the successful completion of his mission.\n\nThis pattern reflects a protagonist who faces a dilemma (the complicated mission), finds a way out with the help of an ally, and ends in a better state than at the beginning (having successfully completed the mission against the odds). This progression indicates that the story follows a specific narrative pattern where the protagonist's condition improves after facing and overcoming significant challenges.\n\n### 4.

The **Double Man in a Hole** story arc fits this description because it involves the protagonist facing two cycles of dilemma and recovery. Tom first falls into a hole (identity compromise and mission failure) and then recovers somewhat (escape from Iran), only to fall into another, deeper hole (capture) and finally recover again (final escape and reunion with his family).\n\n### 4.

Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1:** John's state is one of stress and struggle, trying to manage work and childcare. Hiring Alex marks a potential solution to his problems, indicating a hopeful state.\n- **Event 2:** John's state improves significantly as Alex's presence helps in managing the children and reducing his stress, showing a positive change from the initial state.\n- **Event 3:** Discovering Alex's secret night job leads to a state of anger and betrayal, causing John to let Alex go, which is a downturn in his state compared to the previous event.\n- **Event 4:** Without Alex, John's state worsens as he struggles to manage the household and his job, realizing too late the value Alex brought, indicating a further decline.\n- **Event 5:** John's decision to ask Alex to return and his subsequent acceptance marks a significant improvement in his state, as he learns to accept Alex for who he is and values the positive changes he brings to the household, showing an upward trend.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, it can be observed that John starts in a disadvantaged situation (struggling with work and childcare), experiences an improvement (with Alex's help), faces a setback (when he discovers Alex's secret and lets him go), and ultimately achieves a higher state (when he accepts Alex back and learns to appreciate him for who he is). This pattern of rising, facing a setback, and ultimately achieving a higher state aligns with the **Cinderella** story arc type, which involves a protagonist who rises, faces a setback, and ultimately achieves a higher state.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist in the story can be identified as Gary, a newly-divorced father of two, who hires Cameron as a masseur and sex worker. This identification is based on the fact that the story explores Gary's personal journey, struggles, and transformations more deeply than those of other characters.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. Gary hires Cameron, and they have a brief dispute, after which Cameron decides to help Gary by inviting over Sammy (sentences 1-3).\n2. Sammy arrives, leading to a confrontation, and Gary saves Cameron by pushing him out of the way, resulting in Sammy crashing through Gary's window (sentences 4-6).\n3. Gary reveals he has a brain tumor and only a month to live, expressing regret over his conformist lifestyle and the fact that his wife left him when he came out as gay (sentence 14).\n4. After a series of events involving the disposal of Sammy's body and interactions with Buck and Sandy, Gary and Cameron form a closer bond, culminating in them having sex (sentences 17-22).\n5. Gary's death and the subsequent actions taken by Cameron, including confronting Gary's ex-wife and mourners, stealing Gary's body, and giving him a personal, non-traditional burial (sentences 23-27).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Gary starts in a vulnerable state, seeking companionship and sexual exploration as a newly out gay man. His condition is one of initial openness and seeking help.\n- **Event 2**: After the confrontation, Gary's state shifts to one of immediate danger and then relief, showing a capacity for action and protection. This event introduces chaos into his life but also shows his ability to react under pressure.\n- **Event 3**: With the revelation of his terminal illness, Gary's state becomes one of introspection and regret, highlighting his desire for a more authentic life. This marks a significant downturn in his emotional and physical state.\n- **Event 4**: The bonding with Cameron and the acceptance of his mortality lead to a state of acceptance and possibly a form of liberation for Gary. He finds a moment of peace and connection before his death.\n- **Event 5**: After Gary's death, the focus shifts to Cameron's actions, which can be seen as a continuation of Gary's story in terms of how his legacy and wishes are respected. This event shows Gary's impact on others and the fulfillment of his desire for authenticity, even in death.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. Gary starts in a vulnerable but hopeful state, faces significant challenges and dangers (falling into a dilemma), finds moments of connection and liberation, and ultimately faces a drastic downfall (his death). However, his story concludes with a form of vindication and respect for his wishes, facilitated by Cameron.\n\nGiven these dynamics, the story seems to follow a complex arc that involves elements of facing challenges, personal growth, and an ultimate tragic outcome. The **Oedipus** story arc is characterized by a protagonist who starts high, falls, recovers, and then faces another significant downfall. While Gary's story doesn't perfectly align with a traditional interpretation of the Oedipus arc (since he doesn't exactly start \"high\"), it does involve a cycle of vulnerability, action, introspection, connection, and ultimately, a tragic end that is somewhat redeemed by the actions of others.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Emily, a teenage girl who aspires to pursue a career in English Literature. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Emily returns home to help manage her father's struggling hardware store** (sentence 4), after withdrawing from her English Literature course due to unaffordable student loans.\n2. **Emily meets Alex in Golden Gate Park** (sentence 7), which marks the beginning of a relationship that inspires her and offers emotional support.\n3. **Emily's blog attracts the notice of Maverick Publishing House** (sentence 14), presenting her with an opportunity to pursue her literary dreams.\n4. **Emily's father discovers her secret blog, leading to a heated argument and Emily being dismissed from the store** (sentences 16-18), which puts Emily in a difficult position between her familial obligations and her personal aspirations.\n5. **Emily decides to embark on the Maverick book deal and later finds success with her book, leading to reconciliation with her father and a stronger relationship with Alex** (sentences 21-26), culminating in Emily finding her place in the world and discovering her authentic self.\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Emily's state is one of disappointment and obligation. She has had to withdraw from her desired course of study and return home, indicating a low point in her pursuit of personal and professional goals.\n- **Event 2**: Meeting Alex improves Emily's state, as she finds solace and happiness in their budding relationship. This marks a positive change from her previous state of disappointment.\n- **Event 3**: The opportunity with Maverick Publishing House further elevates Emily's state, offering her a chance to pursue her literary dreams and potentially improve her financial situation. This is another positive change.\n- **Event 4**: The argument with her father and being dismissed from the store puts Emily in a state of distress and uncertainty. This is a negative change from her previously ascending trajectory, as she now faces a significant setback.\n- **Event 5**: Emily's decision to pursue the book deal, her subsequent success, and the reconciliation with her father mark a significant improvement in her state. She achieves personal and professional success, and her relationships are strengthened. This is a positive change and the highest point in the story for Emily.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story follows a pattern where the protagonist, Emily, starts in a disadvantaged situation (withdrawing from college due to financial constraints), experiences a series of events that include both positive developments (meeting Alex, the blog opportunity) and setbacks (conflict with her father, dismissal from the store), and ultimately ends in a much better situation (achieving literary success, reconciling with her father, and strengthening her relationship with Alex). This pattern indicates that Emily's condition improves significantly from the start to the end of the story, despite facing setbacks along the way.\n\nGiven the descriptions of the story arcs provided, Emily's journey aligns closely with the **Cinderella** story arc type. This type is characterized by the protagonist rising, facing a setback, and ultimately achieving a higher state. Emily's rise begins with her meeting Alex and finding inspiration for her blog, she faces a setback with her father's discovery of her blog and the subsequent argument, and she ultimately achieves a higher state with her literary success and the resolution of her personal relationships.\n\n### 4.

Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 6:** Winona is upset and considering ending her relationship with Frank. This event shows her in a state of emotional turmoil and questioning her relationships.\n- **Event 13:** Winona starts dating Ben, indicating a potential for positive change and new relationships in her life. Her state improves slightly as she engages in new experiences and connections.\n- **Event 23:** Winona suffers a panic attack during a job interview, highlighting her struggles with anxiety and her difficulty in coping with stress. This event marks a significant low point in her emotional and psychological state.\n- **Event 33:** After a misunderstanding about her father's actions, Winona learns the truth and experiences relief.

Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story starts with Winona in a somewhat stagnant and unhappy state, drops to lower points as she faces various challenges and struggles with anxiety, and then rises as she begins to address her issues and seek help. The key characteristic of the story arc is that Winona's condition improves from the lowest points (especially after Event 45) to the end of the story, where she is on the path to recovery and making positive changes in her life.\n\nGiven this pattern, the story most closely aligns with the \"Man in a Hole\" arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (in this case, struggling with anxiety and personal issues) and finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning. The story does not perfectly fit the \"Rags to Riches\" classification provided, as Winona's journey is more about overcoming personal struggles than achieving a significantly higher social or economic status.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and Major Events\nThe protagonist of the story is Sarah Mitchell, a teenager with an interest in the paranormal. However, as the story progresses, it can be argued that the focus shifts towards Leah, especially in the latter parts of the narrative. For the purpose of this analysis, we will consider Sarah as the primary protagonist for the majority of the story and then shift focus to Leah towards the end.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. **The Decision to Spend the Night in the Haunted Cottage**: Sarah proposes and her friends agree to spend the night in the notorious cottage (sentence 5).\n2. **The Disappearance of Beth**: Beth vanishes into the darkness of the cottage, marking a significant turn in the story (sentence 15).\n3. **The Realization of Being Trapped**: Sarah and Leah realize they are trapped by an invisible entity, escalating their fear (sentence 18).\n4. **The Discovery of the Secret Room and the Truth About the Cottage**: The girls find a secret room with newspaper clippings revealing the cottage was once the home of a ruthless serial killer (sentence 22).\n5. **The Final Confrontation and Sacrifice**: Sarah makes a decision to draw the malevolent force towards herself, allowing Leah to escape, but at the cost of her own life (sentence 26).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n- **Event 1 (The Decision to Spend the Night in the Haunted Cottage)**: Sarah is in a state of excitement and anticipation, eager to explore the paranormal. Her condition is relatively high, as she is taking the lead and making decisions that her friends follow.\n- **Event 2 (The Disappearance of Beth)**: Sarah's state shifts to one of concern and fear. The disappearance of her friend indicates that things are not going as planned, and the situation is becoming more serious.\n- **Event 3 (The Realization of Being Trapped)**: Sarah's condition worsens as she and Leah realize they are trapped. This realization increases their fear and sense of desperation.\n- **Event 4 (The Discovery of the Secret Room and the Truth About the Cottage)**: At this point, Sarah and Leah are in a state of terror and desperation. The discovery of the serial killer's history in the cottage explains the haunting and increases their fear for their lives.\n- **Event 5 (The Final Confrontation and Sacrifice)**: Sarah's state is one of ultimate sacrifice. She decides to give her life to save Leah, indicating a peak of bravery and selflessness but also a tragic end to her story.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\nGiven the progression of Sarah's condition throughout the story, it starts with her being in a position of leadership and excitement, then gradually worsens as she faces increasingly dire situations, culminating in her tragic sacrifice. However, if we consider the overall narrative including the shift in focus towards Leah, especially in the last scenes, the story can be seen as taking a darker turn for the protagonist (initially Sarah, then the group including Leah). The final scene hints at Leah being potentially haunted again, suggesting that the terror might not be over for her, indicating a continuing downward spiral for the protagonist's condition.\n\nThe story arc classification provided is \"Riches to Rags,\" which typically involves a protagonist starting in a high state and ending in a lower one. Considering Sarah's journey from a position of excitement and leadership to her ultimate sacrifice, and then Leah's potential for another horrific experience, this classification seems fitting as it reflects a deterioration in the protagonist's condition over time.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identify the protagonist and 5 major events in the story.\n\nThe protagonist of the story can be considered as Dana, Trish's daughter, since the story revolves around her and her friends' encounter with Russ Thorn and the subsequent events.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. The girls arrive at the cabin and prepare to confront Russ Thorn (events 9-15).\n2. Alix discovers the mechanic's truck with Dave's drilled-out eyes, and the girls prepare to defend themselves (events 16-20).\n3. The girls encounter Russ Thorn and work together to kill him (events 26-33).\n4. After killing Russ, the girls are attacked by a mysterious assailant, later revealed to be Kay, Russ Thorn's mother (events 36-40).\n5. The truth about Kay is revealed, and Dana, along with her mother Trish, works to stop Kay and ultimately kills her (events 46-50).\n\n### 2. Describe the protagonist's state at each event and how it changed relative to the previous events.\n\n- **Event 1**: Dana's state is one of excitement and anticipation as she heads out for a girls' weekend. Her condition is positive, looking forward to a fun trip with her friends.\n- **Event 2**: Dana's state changes to one of alarm and readiness as they discover signs of Russ Thorn's presence. Her condition worsens due to the danger but improves in terms of determination and preparedness to face the threat.\n- **Event 3**: After successfully killing Russ Thorn, Dana's state improves significantly as she feels a sense of relief and accomplishment. Her condition is better than at the start, having overcome a significant threat.\n- **Event 4**: The discovery that they are being attacked by another assailant, and the loss of friends, puts Dana in a state of fear, grief, and desperation. Her condition worsens again, facing a new and unexpected threat.\n- **Event 5**: With the truth about Kay revealed and her eventual defeat, Dana's state improves as she experiences relief and closure. Her condition at the end is better than at the beginning, having overcome not one but two significant threats and finding resolution.\n\n### 3. Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain your reasoning.\n\nThe story arc of Dana can be seen as facing two major cycles of dilemma and recovery. Initially, she faces the threat of Russ Thorn, overcomes it, but then faces another, even more personal threat from Kay. Each time, she moves from a state of safety or normalcy into danger and then back out to safety or a state of resolution. This pattern of falling into a dilemma (the \"hole\") and then finding a way out, only to face another dilemma and again find a way out, aligns with the **Double Man in a Hole** story arc. The protagonist's condition improves from the first turning point to the last, with significant setbacks in between, which is characteristic of this story arc type.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To analyze the story arc, let's first identify the protagonist and major events in the story.\n\n1. **Protagonist Identification and Major Events:**\n   - The protagonist of the story can be considered as Krista, given that the story concludes with her finding a sense of closure, which suggests her emotional journey is a central focus.\n   - Five major events in the story are:\n     1. Krista meets Nito at a party (sentence 7), marking the beginning of their relationship.\n     2. Nito is arrested after fighting off a man who tried to grab Krista (sentence 10), showing Krista's concern for Nito and her involvement in his life.\n     3. Krista and Nito share a kiss (sentence 14), indicating a deepening of their relationship.\n     4. Nito is fatally shot by Adam (sentence 20), which is a tragic event directly affecting Krista.\n     5. Krista confronts Adam and ensures he is detained (sentences 25-27), leading to her finding closure.\n\n2. **Protagonist's State at Each Event:**\n   - **Event 1 (Krista meets Nito):** Krista's state is one of curiosity and openness, as she is interested in Nito after watching his skateboarding videos online. This is a positive, hopeful state.\n   - **Event 2 (Nito is arrested):** Krista's state becomes one of worry and possibly guilt for not being able to prevent Nito's arrest. This is a slightly negative state compared to the previous event.\n   - **Event 3 (Krista and Nito share a kiss):** Krista's state improves to one of happiness and connection, as her relationship with Nito deepens. This is a positive state.\n   - **Event 4 (Nito is fatally shot):** Krista's state drastically worsens to one of grief, shock, and possibly anger. This is a very negative state.\n   - **Event 5 (Krista confronts Adam):** Krista's state changes to one of determination and ultimately closure, as she takes action against Adam and finds a way to deal with her grief. This is a more positive state than the previous event, indicating recovery.\n\n3. **Story Arc Classification:**\n   - The story starts with Krista in a hopeful state, then faces setbacks (Nito's arrest, his death), but ultimately rises to a state of closure and empowerment (confronting Adam). This pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist faces challenges, falls into a difficult situation, but then recovers to a better state than before the challenges began.\n   - Given this pattern, the story most closely follows the **Cinderella** arc, where the protagonist rises, faces a setback, and ultimately achieves a higher state. Krista's journey from meeting Nito, experiencing the tragedy of his death, and then finding closure by confronting Adam mirrors this arc. The **Cinderella** story arc is characterized by an initial rise, a fall, and then a final rise to an even higher point, which aligns with Krista's emotional and empowerment journey throughout the story.\n\n4. **Determined Story Arc Type:**\nCinderella"

He achieves a major goal by becoming the heavyweight champion, overcoming his previous defeat and proving his capabilities.\n- **Event 5 (Defending the Title):** Jonathan's state reaches its peak. He successfully defends his title, solidifying his position as a champion and achieving a high level of success and recognition. His condition is the best it has been throughout the story.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the analysis, Jonathan starts in a relatively low state (as an amateur fighter in a small town), rises to a position of promise (being discovered and joining the Titans), faces a setback (his first professional defeat), and then ultimately achieves a higher state (becoming and defending the heavyweight champion). This pattern follows the **Cinderella** story arc, where the protagonist rises, faces a setback, and ultimately achieves a higher state. The key elements are the initial rise, the temporary fall, and the final, higher achievement.\n\n### 4. Determined Story Arc Type\n\nCinderella"

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Reiss Gibbons, the MMA fighter. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. Reiss' win and subsequent decision to fight Randy Stone (sentences 1-6).\n2. Reiss' loss to Randy Stone (sentences 7-13).\n3. Reiss' decision to take a fight against Nightmare and his subsequent loss (sentences 14-20).\n4. Reiss' retirement and hitting rock bottom (sentences 21-24).\n5. Reiss' rematch against Randy Stone and his victory (sentences 26-33).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1:** Reiss is at the top of his career, feeling confident and on top of the world after a win and with numerous endorsement deals and movie offers. His state is one of success and high status.\n- **Event 2:** After losing to Randy Stone, Reiss moves into a state of humiliation and anger, seeking revenge. His condition worsens significantly as he loses his title and faces public ridicule.\n- **Event 3:** Following his loss to Nightmare, Reiss' state deteriorates further. He faces not only professional defeat but also financial struggles and a loss of confidence. His condition is at a low point, with his desire to fight diminished.\n- **Event 4:** At the point of retirement, Reiss is at his lowest. He's not only lost his passion for fighting but is also facing financial ruin and emotional breakdown. This is the nadir of his condition.\n- **Event 5:** With his victory in the rematch against Randy Stone, Reiss' state improves dramatically. He regains his confidence, proves his worth as a fighter, and earns respect. His condition ends on a high note, with him celebrating his victory and looking forward to the future.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified by examining the trajectory of the protagonist's condition throughout the story. Initially, Reiss is in a high state (success and confidence), then he falls into a dilemma (loss and humiliation), finds a way out (deciding to fight again), only to fall again (loss to Nightmare and hitting rock bottom), and finally finds a way out again (victory in the rematch and regaining confidence).\n\nThis pattern of falling into a dilemma, finding a way out, falling again, and then finally recovering matches the **Double Man in a Hole** story arc type. The protagonist experiences two cycles of dilemma and recovery, with his condition improving from the first turning point to the last turning point, but with significant setbacks in between.\n\n### 4.

when it does, the pig is killed with a shotgun.\n4) This incident gets Amorth in trouble with a Church tribunal, since he acted without permission from superiors.\n5) One tribunal member is a friendly African Bishop, Lumumba, but another is a vicious American Cardinal, Sullivan, skeptical of demonic possession.\n6) Amorth replies that evil does exist and that he did not perform an actual exorcism but rather, some psychological theater to help the mentally ill man.\n7) Disgusted, Amorth walks out of the tribunal.\n8) The Pope assigns Amorth to visit a possessed boy named Henry in Spain.\n9) Henry, his mother Julia, and his rebellious teenage sister Amy had traveled from America to take possession of a mysterious old Spanish abbey, Julia's husband's sole bequest to his family after he died in a car accident where Henry was present.\n10) The traumatized Henry has not spoken since the accident.\n11) Following a sinister fire, workers who were restoring the abbey so the family could sell it, leave.\n12) Henry starts behaving bizarrely, and supernatural events unfold; serum chemistry panels and MRI show nothing abnormal.\n13) Diabolically possessed, Henry requests a priest; the local Father Tomas Esquibel arrives, but Henry obscenely derides him.\n14) Amorth arrives and enlists Esquibel as an assistant, though Esquibel is untrained as an exorcist.\n15) Esquibel has heard of Amorth but not read Amorth's books; Amorth believes they are good books.\n16) Amorth advocates the importance of prayer, though Esquibel makes mistakes as an assistant exorcist, including strangling Henry when Henry antagonizes him, mocking him for his sins.\n17) The duo attempt to exorcise Henry, without success, as he utters blasphemous phrases during the rite.\n18) Henry's demon even possesses Amy at times.\n19) Amorth finds Julia has not been a religious believer since childhood.\n20) Still, he convinces her to pray after she reveals that she believed that her guardian angel helped her in her youth.\n21) In Rome, the Pope becomes ill while reading documents about the Spanish case and is hospitalized.\n22) Amorth finds a well on the abbey grounds going down to a complex sealed off by the Church as demonically dangerous.\n23) He learns that a founder of the Spanish Inquisition, an exorcist, was possessed, which let him infiltrate the Church and do many evils.\n24) Amorth also finds the Church covered this up and eventually discovers the name of Henry's demon, Asmodeus, which will assist the exorcism.\n25) Amorth and Esquibel participate in the sacrament of Confession and Absolution, mutually confessing and absolving each other of their sins: that after Amorth, an Italian partisan, survived World War II and vowed to serve God in gratitude, a mentally ill woman asked for Amorth's help, and died by suicide when he did not help her due to pride; and Esquibel fornicated with a young woman he did not later marry.\n26) The two ready themselves; Amorth instructs Esquibel to wear a Miraculous Medal necklace.\n27) During the exorcism, they have horrible visions of the women whom they failed.\n28) The exorcism succeeds only when Amorth offers himself to be possessed, which chimes with Asmodeus's previously stating that he wants to destroy Amorth.\n29) Amorth tries to hang himself, but the demon doesn't allow it, preferring that Amorth infiltrate and destroy the Church.\n30) However, Esquibel helps Amorth drive away the demon and demonic appearances resembling the two women who troubled the men, successfully banishing Asmodeus back to Hell.\n31) The Pope does recover, as does Henry while the Vatican purchases and reconsecrates the abbey.\n32) The triumphant duo visit Rome and find Sullivan has taken leave in Guam, being replaced by Lumumba.\n33) Amorth and Esquibel are admitted to a special Church archive;

Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **First Attempt (August 2011):** Diana is determined and ready to tackle her long-held dream. Her state is one of anticipation and courage. This is the beginning of her journey, and she is at a relatively high point, eager to start.\n\n2. **Box Jellyfish Sting (Second Attempt):** Diana faces a significant setback due to the jellyfish sting, which poses a serious threat to her health and forces her to stop her attempt. Her state changes to one of vulnerability and defeat, marking a low point in her journey.\n\n3. **Argument with Bonnie:** After the setbacks and Bonnie's concerns about Diana's safety, their argument leads to Bonnie quitting. Diana is now not only facing physical challenges but also emotional and relational setbacks. Her state is one of isolation and desperation, another low point.\n\n4. **Reconciliation with Bonnie:** When Bonnie agrees to train Diana again, it marks a turning point where Diana's state improves. She regains her support system and possibly refines her approach to the challenge, indicating a rise from her previous low point.\n\n5. **Successful Completion of the Swim:** Finally, Diana achieves her dream by successfully swimming from Cuba to Florida. Her state at this point is one of triumph, fulfillment, and joy, marking the highest point in her journey.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nAnalyzing Diana's state throughout these major events, we see that she starts with a high level of determination, faces significant setbacks (both physical and emotional), and then rises to ultimately achieve her goal. This pattern indicates that the story follows a specific arc where the protagonist faces challenges, experiences setbacks, but ultimately ends in a higher state than where she began.\n\nThe story arc that best fits this pattern is one where the protagonist rises, faces a setback, and ultimately achieves a higher state. This matches the description of the Cinderella story arc, where despite facing numerous challenges and setbacks, the protagonist achieves a triumphant conclusion.\n\n### 4.

operations worldwide, comes to life.\n2) His world takes an unexpected turn when he receives a jarring, late-night phone call bearing the news about a childhood comrade, Peter Johnson.\n3) The distressing details unveil chilling allegations against Peter, accusing him of murdering his genial wife Anna, adored by her students thanks to her career as a schoolteacher, and their bubbly 7-year-old son, Sam.\n4) The reports also insinuate that Peter, unable to bear the guilt, terminated his own life in their ornate Victorian-style abode, concluding this horrendous narrative.\n5) The melancholic ambience of disbelief and confusion haunt John, leaving him unable to digest the fact that Peter, a man he had known to be full of empathy and always known for his gentle demeanor, could ever end up performing such monstrous acts.\n6) Bolstered with the trust and loyalty he felt for Peter, John takes it upon himself to unravel the layers of this ominous mystery.\n7) With a hopeful heart, he steps on this treacherous path vying for a more luminous and credible truth.\n8) He finds himself gravitating back towards the calm, picturesque coastal town of Stonewall, brimming with sweet childhood memories, quite unchanged with its inherent charming appeal.\n9) As John returns to Stonewall after years of being away, the taut community of hardworking lumberjacks, worn-out sailors, and friendly shopkeepers who had known him as a young lad, greet him with an array of expressions from startled surprise to barely concealed suspicion.\n10) Not easily perturbed by the lukewarm interactions with the locals, John commences his self-appointed investigation, filled with an unwavering resolve and unyielding determination to uncover the truth.\n11) In his quest, he analyses Peter's last two days of life.\n12) He finds himself stepping into the poignant stillness of the beautiful but tragic Victorian house now owned by the deafening silence and initiates detailed interviews with the people who had last seen Peter, such as the local grocery store owner, the obliging postman, and the staunchly professional town doctor.\n13) John, as he delves deeper into the crypt of the crime scene, uncovers covert messages in the form of coded letters and complex notes.\n14) These intriguing clues, imagined by Peter, intertwine elegantly with the memories of their unique, secret language from their shared childhood.\n15) Beneath the tranquil surface of Stonewall, he stumbles upon an oblique web of conspiracy that hints at clandestine secrets hidden even deeper than he had initially perceived.\n16) Amidst fluctuating revelations that begin to challenge his understanding of the town, John finds himself scrutinizing the people of influence, particularly the town's swaggering, dismissive Sheriff who seems far too eager to close the case as a regular family tragedy and bury the dire implications forever.\n17) A palpable tension begins thickening between John and the intimidating figure of the Sheriff.\n18) An imminent disagreement augments between the two, their perspectives clashing, drawing a line between them in the sand.\n19) John's determination to delve further into the incongruities surrounding Peter's tragic end puts him tooth to tooth with the mighty Sheriff and the powerful mayor of the town, both notorious for ruling Stonewall with iron fists.\n20) Undeterred by the mounting hostility and veiled threats from the influential locals, John stubbornly traces the path paved by Peter's clandestine hints towards the truth he was so desperate to reveal.\n21) His relentless pursuit yanks off the shroud of deception to uncover a shocking reality: Stonewall, under its facade of tranquility, was infested with a nest of criminal activities that included illegal trading, money laundering, and more.\n22) As pieces of the grand puzzle clicked into place, John unearths damning evidence, implicating the town's Sheriff and a respected local businessman as key players in the criminal conclave, revealing them at the heart of the insidious conspiracy.\n23) The plot takes a steep turn as John begins to paint a different picture of Peter.\n24) A picture not of a vile murderer, but that of a passive scapegoat, distorted within the frames of a duplicitous setup masterminded by those who had sworn to uphold peace and justice.\n25) Aware of their secret operations being under potential threat of exposure, the adversaries sit up and take notice of John's investigation.\n26) John's once peaceful existence swiftly gives way to a thrilling struggle for survival as he gets embroiled in these grave circumstances, turning his life into a rollercoaster of adrenaline-fueled challenges, spiralling into a dangerous game of survival against formidable foes.\n27) A high-stakes face-off engulfs the screen as John, the audacious opponents and the rattled townsfolk — torn between their long-trusted town leaders and the unprecedented revelations — come head-to-head in a startling climax.\n28) Slowly, the townsfolk start rallying behind John, swayed by Peter's incriminating evidence exposed posthumously and John's unwavering determination to unmask the villains and restore the truth.\n29) With their web of deceit rapidly unravelling, a confession is reluctantly extracted from both the Sheriff and the prominent businessman, cornered by the silent judgement of their own people.\n30) With their sins laid bare, the antagonists are promptly arrested, the extent of their fall from grace watched by the shock-stricken town.\n31) Vindication arrives for Peter, his rightful legacy restored, casting him as a martyred whistleblower instead of the villain that he was made out to be.\n32) As the once mighty leaders of Stonewall are led away, a palpable sigh of relief breaks through the tension that had strangled Stonewall for far too long, driving away the oppressive atmosphere.\n33) With Peter's grave in the background and the sweeping landscape of Stonewall unfolding in front of him, John promises to protect their shared home.\n34) He vows to defend it against corruption and restore peace and dignity in honour of his departed friend.\n35) The credits roll as the camera pans across the town, capturing Stonewall restored to its original beauty yet irrevocably changed.\n36) It stands at

Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, it can be observed that John starts in a disadvantaged state (emotional turmoil upon learning the news), falls into a deeper dilemma (discovering the conspiracy and confronting danger), and then finds a way out, ending in a better state (achieving vindication for Peter and restoring justice). This pattern matches the **Man in a Hole** story arc type, where the protagonist faces a dilemma, finds a way out, and ends up in a better condition than at the start.\n\n### 4.

Aaron Falk starts in a somewhat disadvantaged position due to his past and the suspicion surrounding him. As he delves into the investigation, he faces challenges and dangers, but ultimately, he uncovers the truth, solves the case, and finds a form of personal redemption. This pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist faces significant challenges, falls into dilemmas (such as the danger with Whitlam and the ongoing suspicion against him), but ultimately finds a way out and ends in a better condition than when he started.\n\nGiven the pattern of facing challenges, being in a \"hole\" (facing dilemmas and dangers), and then recovering to end in a better state, the story arc resembles the **Double Man in a Hole** or simply **Man in a Hole** pattern, as the protagonist experiences a significant downturn (investigating a tragic crime, facing danger, and dealing with past traumas) but ultimately recovers and ends in a better state (having solved the case, cleared names, and found personal closure).\n\n### 4.

a much-needed respite enveloped in the soothing ambient sounds of unspoiled nature, the chirping of unseen birds, and the tranquil whispers of gentle rivers.\n6) The couple embarked on their road trip, their adventure leading them to the log cabin.\n7) The cabin's gruff caretaker, met them with an indifferent shrug and a cursory nod, his weather-beaten hand extending the rustic iron key.\n8) The cedar log cabin held a mournful aura reminiscent of forgotten stories, yet it was presciently attractive with its freshly painted exterior.\n9) Mark managed to uncover age-old newspapers in a dusty corner; their yellowed pages silently blaring tales of unsolved disappearances.\n10) Alice accidentally found a series of eerie charcoal sketches, they portrayed an abstract figure in various grotesque manifestations.\n11) Their sleek iPhones lost network connectivity plunging them into an isolated void, the silence amplifying their escalating worries.\n12) As twilight appeared, strange unidentifiable sounds began to echo from the basement.\n13) Mark ventured into the damp, musky basement, coming face to face with a formidable, iron-clad door that resisted his initial attempts at opening.\n14) They persevered against their fears, overcoming the stiff rusted lock, and unveiling a sinister room filled with horrifying remnants of physical atrocities.\n15) Darkness descended, they noticed spectral apparitions gradually taking form within the cabin.\n16) Every ghostly encounter sent bone-chilling shivers coursing through their beings.\n17) Their attempts to flee the haunted cabin were futile, they were trapped within.\n18) In a fight for survival, they chanced upon an ancient, etched journal in the basement, unfolding stories of malevolent tales driven by heart-wrenching anguish.\n19) The journal painted a poignant picture of a vengeful specter, wrongfully punished, bound unwillingly to the cabin, filled with a tumultuous rage against the injustice suffered.\n20) Amid the horror, the journal detailed the steps an indigenous shaman had taken in a desperate attempt at ridding the cabin of the restless spirit, sparking a flicker of hope within the terrified couple.\n21) With no other options available, they decided to adhere to the rituals prescribed in the ancient text, hoping to free the cabin's incarcerated spirit and, in turn, release themselves from their haunting nightmares.\n22) They initiated the Shaman's purification ritual.\n23) Besieged by horrifying apparitions and paranormal phenomena they could barely comprehend, they relentlessly continued the ritual.\n24) As they recited the last verse from the age-old text, the cabin convulsed violently under the onslaught of a sudden storm only to lull back into an uncanny silence as the first light of dawn streaked across the sky.\n25) The ethereal morning light bathed the cabin in a peaceful aura, a stark contrast to the hair-raising events from the previous night.\n26) The spine-chilling apparitions ceased their torment, leaving behind a surreal stillness, their shocked disbelief slowly giving way to jubilation.\n27) They salvaged their remaining belongings, hurriedly prepared to abandon the cabin.\n28) With newfound bravery and a deeper appreciation for life’s simple liberties, they bid a hasty farewell to the cabin.\n29) The camera pans out, capturing the cabin’s menacing silhouette receding into the distance—a haunting reminder that the chilling saga might not be at its end, prompting questions regarding the certainty of the couple's escape.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better (e.g., 0→1→2→4→10)\n- Riches to Rags: Protagonist starts high and ends lower (e.g., 10→9→8→6→0)\n- Man in a Hole: Protagonist falls into trouble but recovers (e.g., 6→2→1→4→10)\n- Icarus: Protagonist rises then falls dramatically (e.g., 2→4→9→5→1)\n- Double Man in a Hole: Two cycles of fall and recovery (e.g., 6→2→7→4→10)\n- Cinderella: Rise, setback, ultimate triumph (e.g., 1→7→4→1→10)\n- Oedipus: Start high, fall, recover, final fall (e.g., 10→4→7→9→1)",
        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonists in the story are Mark and Alice, a couple residing in Manhattan. For the purpose of analysis, we will consider their collective experiences as the protagonist's journey.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. **The Decision to Escape**: Mark decides to surprise Alice with a trip to a quaint log cabin in the Appalachian hills (sentence 4).\n2. **The Discovery of the Cabin's Dark Past**: Mark and Alice find age-old newspapers and eerie charcoal sketches in the cabin (sentences 9 and 10).\n3. **Confronting the Horror**: They discover a sinister room in the basement filled with remnants of physical atrocities and encounter spectral apparitions (sentences 14 and 15).\n4. **Finding Hope**: They find an ancient, etched journal detailing a way to rid the cabin of the vengeful specter (sentence 18).\n5. **The Ritual and Escape**: They perform the Shaman's purification ritual, leading to the cessation of the haunting and their eventual escape (sentences 22-28).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (The Decision to Escape)**: The protagonists are in a state of longing for escape from their stressful lives. Their condition is one of discomfort and yearning for change.\n- **Event 2 (The Discovery of the Cabin's Dark Past)**: Their state changes to one of curiosity and slight unease as they uncover the cabin's mysterious and possibly dark history.\n- **Event 3 (Confronting the Horror)**: The protagonists' condition worsens significantly as they face terrifying supernatural entities and realize they are trapped. This is a low point in their journey.\n- **Event 4 (Finding Hope)**: With the discovery of the journal, their state shifts from despair to hope. They now have a potential solution to their predicament.\n- **Event 5 (The Ritual and Escape)**: After performing the ritual, their condition improves dramatically as the haunting stops, and they are able to escape. This marks a significant recovery and a return to a state of safety and relief.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story starts with the protagonists in a state of discomfort, seeking change (a relatively low point). They then descend into a nightmare scenario, facing their deepest fears and experiencing a significant downturn in their condition (a lower point). However, they find a way out of this dilemma through the discovery of the journal and the subsequent ritual, leading to their escape and an improvement in their condition. This pattern, where the protagonists fall into a difficult situation and then find a way out, ending in a better state than when they started (considering their newfound appreciation for life), aligns with the **Man in a Hole** story arc type. The key characteristic of this arc is the protagonist's fall into a dilemma and their eventual recovery and improvement.\n\n### 4. Determined Story Arc Type\n\nMan in a Hole"

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Kath. Five major events in the story are:\n1. Kath and Max arrive at the woodland cabin to find it already occupied by Al and Greta (sentences 1-3).\n2. Kath discovers Max and Greta having an affair, leading to her abandonment by Max (sentences 7-9).\n3. Kath decides to track down Greta and understand what happened, leading her to meet Nicholas Barlow (sentences 11-14).\n4. Kath discovers the truth about Nicholas' intentions and the reason behind Max's disappearance (sentences 24-30).\n5. Kath confronts Nicholas, Al, and Greta, and in the ensuing events, Max dies, and she imprisons the others (sentences 31-33).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: Kath's state is one of anticipation and relaxation, looking forward to a weekend getaway with her boyfriend. Her condition is relatively high, expecting a pleasant time.\n- **Event 2**: Kath's state significantly worsens as she discovers Max's infidelity, leading to emotional distress and abandonment. Her condition drops to a low point.\n- **Event 3**: Kath's determination to find Greta and understand the situation shows a recovery in her state. She is proactive and seeking closure, indicating an improvement in her condition.\n- **Event 4**: Upon discovering the sinister plot involving Nicholas, Al, and Greta, Kath's state becomes one of shock, anger, and possibly fear. This is another downturn in her condition as she faces a dangerous and complex situation.\n- **Event 5**: The final confrontation ends with Max's death and Kath imprisoning the antagonists. While she has taken action and gained a form of revenge or justice, the loss of Max and the overall experience likely leave her in a somber, reflective state, not necessarily better off than at the beginning but having undergone significant personal growth and change.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. Kath starts in a relatively good state, faces a significant downfall (Max's betrayal), recovers somewhat by taking action, faces another severe challenge (the truth about Nicholas and the danger to Max), and ultimately ends in a complex state of having resolved the situation but at great personal cost (Max's death and the trauma experienced).\n\nThis pattern aligns with the **Oedipus** story arc, where the protagonist starts high, falls, recovers, and then faces another significant downfall. Kath's journey from a hopeful weekend getaway to the depths of betrayal, through a process of seeking truth and justice, and ending in a state of tragic resolution, fits this arc. The Oedipus arc is characterized by a protagonist who experiences a rise, a fall, a recovery, and then a final, often tragic, downfall. Kath's story, with its themes of betrayal, pursuit of truth, and ultimate tragedy, embodies this pattern.\n\n### 4. Determined Story Arc Type\n\nOedipus"

Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nAnalyzing Margot's condition throughout the story, it's clear that she starts in a hopeful state, seeking answers about her past. As the story progresses, she uncovers dark secrets, faces betrayal, and confronts supernatural dangers, leading to a significant deterioration in her state. Despite the final act of bravery and escape, Margot's overall journey is marked by a decline from a position of curiosity and hope to one of survival against horrific odds. This pattern does not fit the traditional \"Rags to Riches,\" \"Man in a Hole,\" \"Cinderella,\" or \"Icarus\" story arcs, as those typically involve an overall improvement or a specific pattern of rise and fall that doesn't match Margot's trajectory. The \"Riches to Rags\" classification provided seems to misunderstand the protagonist's initial state and the nature of her journey, as Margot does not start in a \"riches\" or high-status position but rather in a state of personal questioning and seeking.\n\nGiven the provided story arcs and analyzing Margot's journey, the closest match seems to be a narrative where the protagonist faces significant challenges and dangers, leading to a desperate fight for survival. However, the exact fit based on the descriptions provided is challenging because Margot's story involves a complex interplay of discovery, danger, and survival that doesn't neatly align with the simplistic models described. The initial classification of \"Riches to Rags\" does not accurately reflect Margot's journey from a state of curiosity and hope to survival against supernatural horrors.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist in the story is Robert, the host of a local news talk show. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Robert's life before Daniel's visit**: Robert is living a simple life in Clearfield, hosting a local news talk show.\n2. **Daniel's visit and the proposition**: Daniel visits Robert and proposes an opportunity for Robert to experience life in New York City, promising networking opportunities and introductions to influential media figures.\n3. **Robert's discovery of Daniel's homosexuality and his own emotional struggle**: Daniel reveals his homosexuality to Robert, which leads Robert to grapple with his own emotions and preconceived notions about homosexuality.\n4. **Robert's acceptance of his sexuality and decision to come out**: After struggling with his feelings and receiving support from the LGBTQ+ community, Robert accepts his own homosexuality and decides to come out publicly on his show.\n5. **The aftermath of Robert coming out**: Robert admits his love for Daniel and reveals his homosexuality to his audience, sparking a nationwide dialogue on homosexuality and broader acceptance.\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1 (Robert's life before Daniel's visit)**: Robert is in a state of tranquility and simplicity, content with his life in Clearfield.\n- **Event 2 (Daniel's visit and the proposition)**: Robert's state changes as he becomes curious and adventurous, deciding to leave his comfortable life for an experience in New York City. This marks an increase in Robert's openness to new experiences but also introduces uncertainty.\n- **Event 3 (Robert's discovery of Daniel's homosexuality and his own emotional struggle)**: Robert's state shifts to one of confusion and emotional turmoil as he grapples with Daniel's revelation and his own feelings. This is a low point for Robert, as he is faced with the challenge of reevaluating his beliefs and understanding his own sexuality.\n- **Event 4 (Robert's acceptance of his sexuality and decision to come out)**: Robert's state improves significantly as he accepts his homosexuality and finds the courage to be open about it. This marks a turning point where Robert begins to overcome his internal struggles and move towards a more authentic and empowered state.\n- **Event 5 (The aftermath of Robert coming out)**: Robert reaches a high point, having found acceptance and love, both from himself and others. Despite the controversy, he sparks a positive change and finds happiness with Daniel.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story follows Robert as he falls into a dilemma (upon learning about Daniel's homosexuality and grappling with his own sexuality) and then finds a way out, ending in a better state than where he began. Initially, Robert is content but unfulfilled and unaware of his true self. As the story progresses, he faces challenges and uncertainties, reaching a low point of confusion and emotional struggle. However, with support and self-discovery, Robert overcomes these challenges, leading to a higher state of self-acceptance, love, and a positive impact on his community.\n\nThis pattern fits the **Man in a Hole** story arc, where the protagonist faces a problem, hits a low point, and then recovers to a state better than the initial one. Robert's journey from ignorance and simplicity to awareness, acceptance, and ultimately, to becoming an agent of change, exemplifies this arc.\n\n### 4. Determined Story Arc Type\n\nMan in a Hole"

        "output": "To analyze the story arc, let's first identify the protagonist and major events in the story.\n\n1. **Protagonist Identification and Major Events:**\n   - The protagonist of the story is Michael Ausiello.\n   - Five major events in the story are:\n     1. Michael meets Kit Cowan at a gay nightclub (sentence 2).\n     2. Kit comes out to his parents and reveals Michael as his boyfriend (sentence 10).\n     3. Michael and Kit develop complications in their relationship, leading to a separation (sentence 19).\n     4. Kit is diagnosed with a rare form of stage-4 neuroendocrine cancer (sentence 21).\n     5. Kit's death and Michael's reflection on their life together (sentences 29-37).\n\n2. **Protagonist's State at Each Event:**\n   - **Event 1 (Meeting Kit):** Michael's state is one of potential and new beginnings. He has just met someone he connects with, which opens up possibilities for a relationship.\n   - **Event 2 (Kit Coming Out):** Michael's state improves as he is accepted by Kit's parents, indicating a deepening of their relationship and an overcoming of a significant hurdle.\n   - **Event 3 (Relationship Complications):** Michael's state worsens due to the complications in their relationship, including his own personal struggles with alcoholism and suspicions of infidelity. This marks a low point in their relationship.\n   - **Event 4 (Kit's Diagnosis):** Michael's state becomes one of concern and caregiving. He reconciles with Kit and supports him through his illness, showing a shift towards prioritizing their relationship and Kit's well-being.\n   - **Event 5 (Kit's Death):** Michael's state is one of grief and reflection. Despite the sadness of losing Kit, Michael reflects on the positive impact of their relationship on his life and the growth he experienced.\n\n3. **Story Arc Classification:**\n   The story arc can be classified by examining the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. The protagonist starts in a relatively positive state (meeting someone new), faces challenges and setbacks (relationship complications, Kit's illness), but ultimately ends in a state of reflection and growth, despite the tragic loss of his partner. This pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist falls into difficulties but finds a way to end in a better state than when he started, considering the personal growth and the fulfillment of his relationship with Kit.\n\n   The **Man in a Hole** story arc fits this description because Michael falls into a dilemma (relationship problems, dealing with Kit's illness and eventual death) but ends in a state of personal growth and appreciation for the life they built together, which is an improvement from his initial state of insecurity and fear of not being in a long-term relationship.\n\n4. **Determined Story Arc Type:**\nMan in a Hole"

their investigative journey.\n13) They rummage meticulously through untouched evidence, unfazed by the disconcerting echo of emptiness reverberating within the pub's stone-walled interior.\n14) The tight-lipped villagers, slowly persuaded, begin to weave ancient tales of The Final Stop's sordid past, each account more troubling than the previous.\n15) As the agents' unsolicited journey into the pub's hidden secret inches forward, anomalies — inconsistencies in the time of death, the unnatural contortion of the victims' remains — begin cropping up, pushing them further into a maze of confusion.\n16) The agents stumble upon unnerving discoveries as their search deepens.\n17) The oak bar counter is slashed with vicious scratch marks, raw and fresh, as if made by sinister claws; unusual symbols are scored onto the round tables, their chilling imprints hinting at a foreboding presence beyond human understanding.\n18) Their investigation is punctuated by an alarming rise in villager disappearances, upon which their anxiety takes a sharp upward turn.\n19) Stories of an ancient demonic being, known as the Rabid Reaper, have begun to surface.\n20) This eldritch entity was allegedly bound to The Final Stop, sending waves of terror coursing through the agents' spine.\n21) Deep within the pub's poorly lit basement, ensnared by cobwebs, the agents uncover an ancient tome bound in decaying leather.\n22) The ominous sketches that adorn its pages depict grotesque creatures of hellish origins.\n23) The fading ink scrawls cryptic scriptures ripe with hair-raising accounts of black magic and malevolent deities.\n24) As they delve further into the chilling narrative, they learn of the pub's horrifying role — an arcane gateway to an infernal dimension, a reality they had never anticipated.\n25) The unimaginable revelations ignite a passionate discourse between the partners, as they grapple with the overwhelming evidence of supernatural elements, their debates echoing off the crypt-like emptiness within the pub.\n26) As the plot tightens its noose, ideological clashes surface.\n27) Johnson's entrenched skepticism locks horns with Martinez's acceptance of the

pub, every creak of the ancient structure resonates through the tension-laden atmosphere.\n30) Their terrifying rendezvous with the otherworldly intensifies through the night with the apparition of ethereal figures, ghostly whispers in indecipherable tongues, and unguided shifts of antique pewter mugs, sending chills running down their spines.\n31) Their tension escalates, the growing desperation seeping into their determination to combat the supernatural fit.\n32) Painstakingly unravelling the ciphered scriptures scrawled across the pages of the journal, the agents decipher a potential remedy — a ritual aiming at nixing the pub and sealing the interdimensional portal.\n33) Summoning their dwindling courage, Johnson and Martinez concoct an elaborate plan involving a consecrated cross from the village church, fortified circle of coarse salt from the pub's larder, and a series of otherworldly incantations to potentially close the portal.\n34) Apprehension cloaks them as they steel themselves for a final face-off against the Rabid Reaper.\n35) Their battle now stands as the village's only line of defence against the gruesome fate awaiting them.\n36) A steadfast Martinez heads their expedition into the unknown, his spirit burning bright amidst the encroaching darkness.\n37) As they approach the climactic face-off, eldritch apparitions begin to phase in from the shadowy corners of The Final Stop.\n38) Their monstrous forms distort under the dim lantern light, Johnson clenching the old journal tight, using it as their beacon of hope.\n39) The

Martinez takes the self-sacrificial route.\n41) Resolved to lay down his life, the brave recruit inducts a bitter layer of anguish to their ongoing struggle.\n42) Martinez beseeches Johnson to carry on the ritual as he puts himself in harm's way.\n43) Engrossed in combat, Martinez succumbs to his swift fate, his life extinguishing on the cold, unforgiving stone floor.\n44) Mere feet away, Johnson concludes the foreboding incantation, his trembling voice floating through the ethereal dominion of the night.\n45) As the final words reverberate through the air, The Final Stop shudders violently.\n46) Johnson narrowly slips away from the collapsing foundation, escaping the pub right before it succumbs to the divine might, disintegrating under an explosion of dust and debris.\n47) The portal convulses before finally sealing shut, leaving behind a grim reminder of the events that had unfolded — the rubble of what once was The Final Stop.\n48) The villagers, finally resurfacing from their hideouts, gaze in shocked silence at their battered establishments and their worn-down lifeline, their unsolicited saviour standing resilient amidst the ruin.\n49) Johnson, having been hardened and scarred by the ordeal, offers a nod of acknowledgement before retreating towards their inconspicuous vehicle.\n50) The agent drives away from Stoke-On-Tare, the once idyllic countryside transforming into a chilling souvenir of the nightmare-infested reality he had managed to escape.\n51) As dawn breaks, casting a new light on the landscape, Johnson glances into the rearview mirror.\n52) His gaze settles on the remains of The Final Stop bathing under the light of the new day.\n53) Johnson, now a solitary traveller, remains haunted by the legacy of the fatal encounter.\n54) The scar of their supernatural experience taints his soul, as he embarks on a journey shrouded in uncertainty.\n55) The villagers, resilient and hopeful, gather around the ruins of their homeland, their sombre countenances reflecting the daunting task of rebuilding their once tranquil village life.\n56) Johnson directs his attention towards the open road ahead, leaving behind the ominous remnants of the village.\n57) A scratchy police radio buzzed in the background, reporting ordinary thefts and minor altercations.\n58) Yet, a lingering undercurrent of dread persists,

begins to weave itself into the rewritten lore of Stoke-On-Tare.\n60) The fading daylight falls upon the remnants of The Final Stop, casting an eerily beautiful crimson hue onto the demolished facade.\n61) Against the backdrop of the setting sun, an ambiguous silhouette emerges, stretching long atop the debris, suggesting at the possible persistence of a malevolent presence.\n62) As silence takes over the final frame, the audience is left nursing mixed emotions, anticipation of a potential sequel to Johnson's saga simmering under the surface.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches:

Identify the protagonist and 5 major events in the story\n\nThe protagonist in the story is Special Agent Johnson. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. **Receiving the distress call** (sentence 3): This marks the beginning of the agents' journey into the mystery.\n2. **Arriving at The Final Stop and discovering the slaughter** (sentence 9): This event sets the tone for the horror and mystery that Johnson and Martinez are about to uncover.\n3. **Discovering the ancient tome and learning about the pub's role as an arcane gateway** (sentence 21): This revelation significantly escalates the stakes and introduces a supernatural element to the story.\n4. **Martinez's self-sacrifice** (sentence 40): This is a pivotal moment in the story, marking a significant emotional and plot turn.\n5. **Johnson's escape and the sealing of the portal** (sentence 46): This event concludes the main conflict of the story and sets the stage for the aftermath.\n\n### 2. Describe the protagonist's state at each event and how it changed\n\n1. **Receiving the distress call**: Johnson is introduced as a seasoned but weary veteran, carrying the weight of many horrific cases. His state is one of professional readiness but personal cynicism.\n2. **Arriving at The Final Stop and discovering the slaughter**: Johnson's state shifts to one of deep unsettlement and professional engagement. The horror of the scene deepens his emotional investment in the case.\n3. **Discovering the ancient tome and learning about the pub's role**: Johnson's skepticism is challenged by the introduction of supernatural elements. His state becomes one of escalating concern and disbelief, forcing him to consider possibilities beyond his experience.\n4. **Martinez's self-sacrifice**: This event profoundly affects Johnson, introducing a deep sense of loss and guilt. His state becomes one of anguish and determination to see the mission through to its end.\n5. **Johnson's escape and the sealing of the portal**: Johnson emerges victorious but scarred. His state is one of relief mixed with the trauma of his experiences. He is forever changed by the events, his cynicism possibly deepened by the loss of his partner and the supernatural horrors he faced.\n\n### 3. Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain the reasoning\n\nThe story arc of Agent Johnson can be seen as following the **Oedipus** pattern. Initially, Johnson is in a position of professional strength and experience (high point), albeit with personal cynicism. As the story progresses and he delves deeper into the mystery, he faces significant challenges and horrors (fall), particularly with the introduction of supernatural elements that test his worldview. The discovery of the ancient tome and the true nature of The Final Stop represents a point of no return, deepening his fall into the heart of horror. Martinez's sacrifice marks a low point (recovery/fall), where Johnson must come to terms with loss and find the strength to proceed. Finally, Johnson's escape and the sealing of the portal can be seen as a recovery (high point after the fall), but one that is bittersweet due to the trauma and loss he has endured. However, considering the overall trajectory and the fact that Johnson ends the story haunted and alone, having faced a drastic downfall in terms of his personal loss and the shattering of his worldview, it aligns more closely with the **Oedipus** story arc, where the protagonist starts high, falls, and then faces another significant downfall or ends in a state of tragedy or loss.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story can be considered as Shiloh, given that the story begins and ends with her, and her transformation and survival are central to the plot. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. The massacre at The Last Exit bar begins, and Les is shot (Event 10).\n2. The group of heroin addicts, led by Gail, takes control of the bar, and it becomes clear there's another, more violent group outside (Event 11-14).\n3. Will's true nature as a monster is revealed, and he begins killing the patrons (Event 32-35).\n4. Shiloh manages to kill the monster Will and then is attacked by Lori, leading to her transformation into a monster (Event 41-46).\n5. Shiloh, now in monster form, breaks through the barricades and kills the remaining members of the outside group (Event 47).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Massacre begins):** Shiloh is in a state of shock and fear, witnessing the violence and Les' death. Her condition is low due to the trauma and danger.\n- **Event 2 (Addicts take control):** Shiloh's state slightly improves as she is alive and among other survivors, but she is still in grave danger and under the control of violent addicts. Her condition remains precarious.\n- **Event 3 (Will's transformation):** Shiloh's state worsens significantly as she witnesses the terrifying transformation of Will into a monster and the subsequent slaughter of the patrons. She is in immediate danger and experiences intense fear.\n- **Event 4 (Shiloh kills Will and transforms):** Initially, Shiloh's condition improves as she manages to kill the monster Will, which could be seen as a recovery from her previous state of fear and helplessness. However, she then gets attacked and, in response, transforms into a monster herself. This transformation can be seen as a downfall because she loses her human identity and control.\n- **Event 5 (Shiloh in monster form kills the outside group):** Shiloh's state, in terms of power and control, could be seen as improved because she is now capable of defending herself and overpowering her enemies. However, in terms of her humanity and moral condition, she has fallen to a lower state, having become a monster.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc can be classified based on how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the narrative. Initially, Shiloh is in a disadvantaged and dangerous situation (low state). She faces multiple dilemmas and dangers, recovering slightly at times but overall descending into a worse state as the story progresses, especially with her transformation into a monster. This pattern does not fit the \"Rags to Riches,\" \"Man in a Hole,\" \"Cinderella,\" or \"Double Man in a Hole\" arcs because Shiloh does not end in a better condition than she started in terms of her humanity and safety. It also doesn't fit \"Riches to Rags\" perfectly because Shiloh starts in a low state and ends in a different kind of low state, having gained power but lost her humanity. The \"Icarus\" arc doesn't apply well either because Shiloh's rise is not about achieving success or height but about survival and transformation. \n\nThe closest fit is the \"Oedipus\" arc, where the protagonist starts high (or in this case, in a neutral human state), falls into a series of tragic events, recovers slightly (kills the monster Will), and then faces another significant downfall (transforms into a monster and loses her humanity). This arc captures the essence of a tragic fall from a state of innocence or normalcy into a state of monstrosity and loss.\n\n### 4. Determined Story Arc Type\n\nOedipus"

        "output": "### 1. Identify the protagonist and 5 major events in the story\n\nThe protagonist of the story can be considered as both Lady D and Sir D, as the narrative focuses on their individual and collective journey. However, for the purpose of analysis, we can consider their combined experiences as the protagonist's arc, given that their stories intertwine and influence each other significantly.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. The introduction of Lady D and Sir D, each living separate lives but both experiencing dissatisfaction (sentences 1-4).\n2. The arrival of the invitation to the art gallery in Paris and their decision to attend, which sets the stage for their meeting (sentence 5).\n3. The encounter at the airport, where they meet and initially clash due to the flight delay (sentences 6-13).\n4. The turning point where, despite their initial animosity, they begin to share stories and find comfort in each other's company, leading to a rekindling of their past camaraderie (sentences 18-22).\n5. The resolution, where they finally board the plane to Paris, having reestablished their friendship and found a new sense of peace and understanding (sentences 28-30).\n\n### 2. Describe the protagonist's state and how it changed relative to the previous events\n\n- **Event 1 (Introduction):** The protagonists, Lady D and Sir D, are introduced in a state of dissatisfaction and ennui, despite their outward success. This sets a low point in their emotional and psychological state.\n- **Event 2 (Invitation to Paris):** The decision to attend the art gallery opening marks a potential turning point for change but does not immediately alter their state of dissatisfaction. It's more of a catalyst for the events that will follow.\n- **Event 3 (Airport Encounter):** Initially, their meeting and the circumstances (flight delay) exacerbate their frustration and dissatisfaction, leading to a further decline in their state. However, this event also marks the beginning of their interaction, which will eventually lead to positive change.\n- **Event 4 (Sharing and Comfort):** As they share their stories and find comfort in each other's company, their state begins to improve. They move from a place of loneliness and dissatisfaction to one of connection and understanding. This is a significant turning point where their condition starts to improve.\n- **Event 5 (Resolution):** By the end, they have rekindled their friendship, found a deeper understanding of each other, and seem to have overcome their initial dissatisfaction. This marks a high point in their emotional and psychological state compared to the beginning of the story.\n\n### 3. Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain your reasoning\n\nThe story arc of Lady D and Sir D follows a pattern where they start in a state of dissatisfaction, face challenges and conflicts (particularly in their initial encounter), but ultimately find a way out of their dilemma through their reconnection and shared experiences. This pattern suggests a \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonists fall into a dilemma (their dissatisfaction and conflict) but find a way out, ending in a better state than they began with. The key characteristic of this arc is the improvement in the protagonist's condition from the lowest point (their clash and frustration at the airport) to the end (their renewed friendship and peace).\n\n### 4.

Her encounter with Bill brings up past emotions but doesn't immediately indicate a significant change in her state.\n- **Event 2**: The storm and subsequent flight delays put Willa in a situation where she must confront her past through her interactions with Bill. This could be seen as a dip in her emotional state as she deals with nostalgia and possibly unresolved feelings.\n- **Event 3**: Revealing her past to Bill, including the miscarriage and giving up her daughter for adoption, shows that Willa is in a vulnerable state. However, sharing this information might also be a step towards healing or closure.\n- **Event 4**: Learning that her daughter wants to meet her and deciding to go through with the meeting significantly improves Willa's state. This event brings hope and the possibility of resolving past regrets or unfinished business.\n- **Event 5**: Parting ways with Bill after rekindling their connection and with the prospect of meeting her daughter, Willa's state improves further.

troubles, he was a constant occupant of a whisky-stained stool at O'Malley's Pub where the locals gathered.\n3) Despite testing the patience of the gruff barman, Liam, Reece's good-natured banter and charismatic charm had a way of smoothing things over, securing him another drink on his account.\n4) At the end of yet another long night, Reece ambled out of the pub, having paid his substantial bill with his most recent winning scratch-off ticket.\n5) He then made his way to Marlboro's only 24-hour convenience store, Lloyd's Groceries.\n6) With trembling hands and a foggy breath, he mustered enough clarity to hand over his latest New Hampshire lottery ticket to the elderly clerk, Jesse.\n7) His eyes, although bleary, eagerly awaited the ticket validation.\n8) Suddenly, the narrow, cramped store buzzed with an electrifying revelation - Reece's ticket was a winning one worth a staggering $200,000!\n9) The news spread through the town like a wild forest fire, causing Marlboro's residents to gape at their infamous troublemaker in shock.\n10) Tales of Reece’s unanticipated fortune and his claimed commitment to reform replaced his previous antics as the talk of the town.\n11) With teary eyes and a faltering voice, Reece pledged to the people of Marlboro that he would abandon his life of alcohol and mischief, hoping to transform himself into a responsible citizen.\n12) The locals met this pledge with doubtful smiles and hopeful gazes.\n13) True to his impulsive nature, Reece wasted no time in extravagant spending.\n14) He purchased an opulent mansion on Birch Street furnished with exquisite furniture and crystalline chandeliers.\n15) His cabinets, unfortunately, were also stocked with high-end bourbon and a stash of illicit narcotics.\n16) The calm rustic serenity of Marlboro came under threat as Reece spiraled into an unrestrained whirlwind of daily hedonistic parties.\n17) His reckless partying and squandering of his newfound wealth were observed with growing trepidation and disappointment by the locals who had started to warm up to him.\n18) Unfazed by the growing disapproval, Reece retorted that his current mode of living was merely a grander extension of his old habits.\n19) Amongst all the turmoil, Jenny Davis, Reece's enduring friend, witnessed his rapid descent with tearful helplessness, unable to intervene effectively.\n20) Unable to stand by and watch anymore, Jenny defiantly confronted Reece about his reckless spending and destructive lifestyle.\n21) However, Reece, living in a constant state of intoxication, simply brushed-off and rebutted Jenny's earnest pleas and serious concerns.\n22) Feeling defeated yet absolutely determined, Jenny reached out to Marlboro Rehab Center, exposing Reece's escalating issues with substance addiction.\n23) Chronically wary of Reece's cunning manipulative conduct and history of refusal to cooperate, the rehab center staff greeted Jenny's plea skeptically.\n24) Reece, on hearing Jenny's intervention attempts, reacted defensively, choosing his addictions over their deep-seated friendship.\n25) Time blurred as Reece indulged further into his addictions.\n26) His life unwinding faster than he could grasp.\n27) His nights painted with raucous laughter, liquor, and a cocktail of drugs.\n28) One harrowing morning, Reece woke up in his empty mansion, clothed in a stench of alcohol and

the wreckage of his once proud mansion, Reece took a good look at his devastated property, serving as a hideous mirror to his life.\n33) Shaken by the sheer magnitude of his fall, Reece, with throbbing temples and shaking hands, started cleaning his mansion.\n34) The prospect of layoffs, the loss of Jenny, and the startled realization of his downfall provoked Reece to swallow his pride and approach Marlboro Rehab Center humbly for help.\n35) Marlboro's locals, habitually skeptical of Reece, surprised themselves by cautiously applauding his honesty and apparent commitment to change.\n36) Overcoming grim memories and apathy, Reece took his first step towards rebuilding his shattered relationships.\n37) He reached out to Jenny, leaving her a heartfelt apology note at her doorstep.\n38) Reece's sincere attempts to change began to soften the affront of the townsfolk.\n39) They started extending their hesitant support to his transformation.\n40) Amidst this small town's riveting drama, Jenny discovered Reece's letter one subdued night.\n41) Her tear-filled sapphire eyes read the note and she allowed a glimmer of hope to spark.\n42) Jenny made a cautious return to Reece's life by

transformation publicly.\n49) His solemn oath signaled the end of his debauched life and the commencement of his journey towards community service and promoting sobriety.\n50) Reece, once notorious

slowly but surely gained the admiration of the locals for his sheer willpower and determination.\n52) Reece accomplished more than just personal reform.\n53) He mended broken relationships and gave the town of Marlboro not just a tale but a living testament to human resilience.\n54) Reece's life, originally filled with reckless abandonment and damaging addictions, strewed with regrets, turned into a story of inspiration and transformation.\n55) The locals of Marlboro, accustomed to seeing Reece as the personification of mischief, now regularly witness him assisting in community restoration projects, working tirelessly under the blistering midday sun.\n56) Reece, turned his weed-strewn path towards destruction into a beautifully paved road to redemption, which inspired the entire town of Marlboro.\n57) Reece and Jenny, now stronger together than ever, leveraged their experiences to act as pillars of support to others in need, paradoxically becoming the backbone of their once estranged

Marlboro, you will find Reece, the once miscreant, working with the youth of the town, sharing his experiences, and helping shape a better community.\n60) The tale of Reece's transformation, from the

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Reece, a 35-year-old vagabond known for causing trouble in the small town of Marlboro, New Hampshire. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. Reece wins a significant amount of money from a lottery ticket (sentence 8).\n2. Reece pledges to change his life and become a responsible citizen after winning the lottery (sentence 11).\n3. Despite his pledge, Reece spirals into a life of hedonistic parties and substance abuse, squandering his wealth (sentences 13-16).\n4. Reece hits rock bottom, realizing the extent of his downfall and the loss of his friend Jenny's trust, and decides to seek help from the Marlboro Rehab Center (sentences 28-34).\n5. Reece successfully undergoes rehabilitation, reforms his life, and becomes a positive influence in the community (sentences 44-60).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Winning the Lottery):** Reece's state changes from being a vagabond living on the edge to suddenly having a significant amount of money. This newfound wealth brings him temporary joy and attention from the town.\n- **Event 2 (Pledging to Change):** Reece appears to be on the path to positive change, expressing a desire to abandon his old life and become a responsible citizen. His state seems to be improving as he garners hope and support from the locals.\n- **Event 3 (Spiraling into Addiction):** Reece's state deteriorates significantly as he falls deeper into substance abuse and reckless spending. Despite initial hopes for change, he succumbs to his old habits, leading to a decline in his relationships and overall well-being.\n- **Event 4 (Hitting Rock Bottom):** Reece reaches a low point, realizing the damage he has done to himself and his relationships. This event marks a turning point where he acknowledges his need for help and begins to seek a way out of his destructive lifestyle.\n- **Event 5 (Rehabilitation and Reform):** Reece's state improves dramatically as he undergoes rehabilitation, mends his relationships, and starts contributing positively to the community. He transforms from a troublemaker to a redeemed figure, symbolizing resilience and recovery.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc can be classified based on the pattern of the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. Reece starts in a disadvantaged situation (as a vagabond), experiences a rise (winning the lottery and pledging to change), faces a significant setback (spiraling into addiction), and then undergoes a recovery (seeking help and reforming his life). This pattern resembles the **Cinderella** story arc, where the protagonist rises, faces a setback, and ultimately achieves a higher state. Reece's journey from a life of trouble and addiction to one of redemption and community service exemplifies this arc.\n\n### 4. Determined Story Arc Type\n\nCinderella"

        "output": "## Step 1: Identify the protagonist and 5 major events in the story.\nThe protagonist of the story is Leslie, a troubled and manipulative alcoholic. Five major events in the story are:\n1. Leslie reunites with her estranged 19-year-old son James and starts living with him (event 3).\n2. Leslie is given a chance to work at a motel by Sweeney in exchange for a small wage and boarding (event 9).\n3. Leslie attempts to focus on her job and maintain sobriety as she suffers through alcohol withdrawal (event 15).\n4. Leslie quits her job at the motel after a confrontation with Nancy and watching a VHS tape of her past (events 18 and 21).\n5. Leslie decides to renovate an abandoned ice cream shop into a diner with Sweeney's help and eventually opens it (events 28-30).\n\n## Step 2: Describe the protagonist's state and how it changed relative to the previous events at each major event.\n1. At the first event, Leslie's state improves as she reunites with her son and has a place to live, showing a potential for change and stability.\n2. At the second event, Leslie's state improves further as she gets a job and a place to stay, indicating a move towards responsibility and recovery.\n3. At the third event, Leslie's state is challenging as she struggles with alcohol withdrawal, but she is making an effort to change, showing determination and a will to improve.\n4. At the fourth event, Leslie's state worsens as she quits her job and faces confrontation, indicating a setback in her recovery and personal growth.\n5. At the fifth event, Leslie's state improves significantly as she finds a new purpose in opening a diner and is sober, showing a successful recovery and personal growth.\n\n## Step 3: Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain the reasoning.\nThe story arc type can be classified based on how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the story. Given the improvements and setbacks Leslie faces, the story seems to follow a pattern where the protagonist rises, faces a setback, and ultimately achieves a higher state. This pattern is characteristic of the Cinderella story arc type, where despite facing challenges and setbacks, the protagonist ultimately ends up in a better condition than at the start.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the story arc type.\nCinderella"

        "output": "### 1. Identification of Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Patrick Kearney, a respected physician living in San Francisco with his loyal dog, Buster. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. The arrival of a letter from Carson City about Patrick's brother's dire circumstances (sentence 6).\n2. Patrick's decision to undertake a rescue mission to save his brother (sentence 9).\n3. The discovery that Patrick's brother is being held captive by bandits over an alleged treasure (sentence 17).\n4. The confrontation and battle with the outlaws to rescue Patrick's brother (sentence 19).\n5. The return to San Francisco, where Patrick reflects on the value of his experiences and relationships over material wealth (sentences 23-28).\n\n### 2. Description of Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **Initial State**: Before the arrival of the letter, Patrick is in a state of peace and respect, enjoying his life as a physician with Buster by his side.\n2. **Decision to Rescue**: Upon learning of his brother's situation, Patrick's state changes to one of worry and inner turmoil, but he decides to act, showing determination.\n3. **Discovery of Captivity**: Learning the specifics of his brother's captivity adds urgency and possibly fear to Patrick's state, but he remains resolute in his mission.\n4. **Confrontation and Rescue**: During the confrontation with the outlaws, Patrick faces danger but emerges victorious, which could be seen as a peak in his determination and courage.\n5. **Return and Reflection**: After rescuing his brother and deciding to leave the gold behind, Patrick's state shifts to one of contentment and a newfound appreciation for the intangible wealth in his life, such as relationships and experiences.\n\n### 3. Classification of Story Arc Type\n\nAnalyzing the protagonist's condition throughout the story:\n- Patrick starts in a good state (as a respected physician).\n- He faces a dilemma (his brother's captivity) that disrupts his peace.\n- He decides to act and faces challenges (the journey, the bandits).\n- He overcomes these challenges (rescues his brother, decides to leave the gold).\n- He ends in a better state than when he started, with a newfound appreciation for life.\n\nThis pattern matches the **Man in a Hole** story arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (the hole) and then finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning. Patrick's journey from a peaceful life, into the challenges of rescuing his brother, and back to a life with a newfound appreciation for relationships and experiences over material wealth, exemplifies this arc.\n\n### 4.

He loses his comfortable life and is subjected to abuse and hardship.\n  \n- **Event 2 (Sold to Perrault):** Buck's state improves slightly as he starts to gain the trust and loyalty of Perrault, Francoise, and the other sled dogs. He finds a new purpose and begins to thrive in his new role.\n\n- **Event 3 (Displaces Spitz):** Buck's state improves further as he becomes the pack leader, earning the respect of the other dogs.

Describe the protagonist's state and changes at each event\n\n- **Event 1**: John is calm and unperturbed in prison, indicating he has found a way to cope with his situation. His state is one of resignation or acceptance.\n- **Event 2**: John's life is dramatically overturned by his arrest, moving from a mundane life to one of severe accusations and imprisonment. His state changes to one of turmoil and injustice.\n- **Event 3**: With the news of another similar murder, John's situation becomes more complex, introducing a glimmer of hope that he might be innocent. His state is one of potential vindication but still trapped.\n- **Event 4**: As John and Sarah uncover the conspiracy, John's innocence becomes more plausible, and he begins to take action towards his freedom. His state shifts towards one of determination and hope.\n- **Event 5**: After the confrontation, John is exonerated and released from prison, marking a significant improvement in his condition from imprisonment to freedom. His state changes to one of relief, gratitude, and new beginnings.\n\n### 3. Classify the story arc type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the story. Initially, John is in a bad situation (prison), then it gets worse (accused of murders), but through his and Sarah's efforts, his situation improves (exonerated and released). This pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist faces significant challenges, hits a low point, and then recovers to an even better state than before.\n\nThe \"Double Man in a Hole\" story arc is characterized by the protagonist facing two cycles of dilemma and recovery. However, in this story, John faces a continuous downward spiral (from arrest to wrongful imprisonment) followed by an upward climb (from potential vindication to actual exoneration and freedom). This doesn't perfectly fit the \"Double Man in a Hole\" pattern, as there's one major downfall followed by a recovery, rather than two distinct cycles of fall and rise.\n\nA more fitting classification would be the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (wrongful imprisonment) and finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning (exonerated, freed, and with a new lease on life).\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Jodie Snyman, a Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (DPCI) officer. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. Jodie finds a murdered man with initials carved on his body, leading to the discovery of a complex case involving human trafficking and corruption (sentence 7).\n2. Jodie discovers that the initials on the dead body are connected to one of the six missing girls abducted by Gert de Jager, hinting at a larger conspiracy (sentence 10).\n3. Jodie uncovers a syndicate of sex trafficking cartels with the help of a hooded killer and begins to work towards cleaning up the society, albeit through unlawful means (sentence 14).\n4. Jodie learns about her colleague Ntombizonke's past and her connection to the case, including being a victim of sexual assault by FJ Nolte, and finds the recorded tape left by Ntombizonke (sentences 16-19).\n5. Jodie's attempt to intercept the sale of young girls to an Iranian Sheikh results in the death of Ntombizonke and another coworker, leading Jodie to take the law into her own hands, killing FJ Nolte and planning to go after the Iranian Sheikh (sentences 22-27).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Jodie is in a state of frustration due to the lack of progress in her human trafficking raids. The discovery of the murdered man and the initials carved on his body presents her with a new, intriguing case that could potentially lead to significant breakthroughs in her work.\n- **Event 2**: Jodie's state shifts from mere investigation to a deeper emotional investment as she uncovers the connection between the current case and the historical abduction of six girls. This realization likely increases her determination to solve the case.\n- **Event 3**: With the uncovering of the sex trafficking syndicate, Jodie's state changes to one of active pursuit of justice, even if it means operating outside the law. This shows a rise in her proactive stance against crime.\n- **Event 4**: Learning about Ntombizonke's past and her connection to the case adds a personal layer to Jodie's investigation. Her state becomes more emotionally complex, with feelings of betrayal, sadness, and a deeper resolve to bring the perpetrators to justice.\n- **Event 5**: After the death of her colleagues and her decision to take the law into her own hands, Jodie's state transforms into one of vengeance and self-appointed justice. She transitions from a law enforcement officer to a vigilante, marking a significant change in her approach and personal risk.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on Jodie's condition throughout the story, it's clear that she faces multiple challenges and setbacks (being in a difficult situation with her operation, uncovering dark secrets, losing colleagues) but also experiences moments of resolve and action (deciding to work outside the law, killing FJ Nolte, planning to go after the Iranian Sheikh). Her journey involves falling into dilemmas (the moral complexity of her actions, the loss of colleagues) and finding ways out, albeit through risky and unlawful means. This pattern of facing challenges, recovering, and then facing another set of challenges before ultimately taking a stand and acting, even if it means going against the law, suggests a story arc that involves cycles of dilemma and recovery.\n\n### 4.

all seem intricately linked.\n14) Burdened with trepidation, she races back to warn Gabriela of the danger they may be surrounded by.\n15) Gabriela, intoxicated by the glitz and glamour, dismisses Elena's warnings as unfounded paranoia.\n16) As the hurricane reaches its peak savagery, the distinguished guests shed their amiable veneers.\n17) They reveal themselves to be acolytes of an ancient cult that worships the destructive power of storms.\n18) The cult members confess to harnessing the immense power of hurricanes for an occult ritual.\n19) The aim -

Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Invitation to the party):** Elena is hesitant but also intrigued by the prospect of breaking free from her monotonous life. Her state is one of indecision and curiosity.\n- **Event 2 (Discovery of the secret chamber):** Elena's state changes to one of suspicion and fear as she uncovers the disturbing symbols and clippings.

Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the story. Initially, Elena is in a stable but unfulfilling state. She then falls into a dilemma (the discovery of the cult and Gabriela's danger) and eventually finds a way out (rescuing Gabriela and escaping), ending in a better state than she began with, having discovered her bravery and strengthened her friendship.\n\nThis pattern fits the **Man in a Hole** story arc, where the protagonist falls into a problem (the hole) and then climbs out of it, often ending in a better condition than where they started. Elena's journey from a monotonous life, through a dangerous ordeal, to a place of newfound respect for herself and her friendship, illustrates this arc.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To analyze the story arc, let's first identify the protagonist and key events in the story.\n\n1. **Identify the Protagonist and Major Events:**\n   - The protagonist of the story is Bee, a working-class young woman from Eastern Europe.\n   - Five major events in the story are:\n     1. Bee arrives at the mansion for the \"hurricane party\" (sentence 1).\n     2. The group plays \"Bodies Bodies Bodies,\" and shortly after, they discover David's dead body (sentences 4-7).\n     3. Bee kills Greg after a confrontation, suspecting him of being the murderer (sentence 11).\n     4. The group's dynamics escalate, with suspicions cast on Bee, leading to her being cast out into the hurricane (sentence 16).\n     5. The truth about the \"murders\" is revealed, showing there was no actual murderer, and the group's fears and actions were misguided (sentences 30-31).\n\n2. **Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes:**\n   - **Event 1 (Arrival at the Mansion):** Bee is in a relatively stable state, attending a party with her girlfriend Sophie. Her condition is neutral, with no immediate conflicts or dangers.\n   - **Event 2 (Discovery of David's Body):** Bee's state changes to one of panic and fear as the group discovers a dead body, and they are trapped without power or phone reception. Her condition worsens due to the danger and uncertainty.\n   - **Event 3 (Killing Greg):** Bee's action of killing Greg is a desperate attempt to protect herself and others from a perceived threat. Her state is one of heightened anxiety and possibly guilt, but she sees it as necessary for survival. Her condition could be seen as temporarily stabilizing because she believes she has eliminated the threat.\n   - **Event 4 (Being Cast Out):** Bee's state deteriorates significantly as she is cast out by the group she trusted, leaving her alone and vulnerable in a dangerous situation (the hurricane). Her condition worsens both physically and emotionally.\n   - **Event 5 (Revelation of the Truth):** Upon learning the truth that there was no murderer and that the deaths were accidental or due to the group's own actions, Bee's state could be seen as a mix of relief and possibly shame or regret over her actions. However, the overall trajectory from the start of the story to this point shows a significant decline in her condition from a state of relative safety and trust to one of isolation, violence, and mistrust.\n\n3. **Classify the Story Arc Type:**\n   - The story arc type can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the story. Starting from a neutral or positive state, Bee's condition worsens significantly as the story progresses, marked by increased danger, mistrust, and eventual isolation. Even the final revelation, while providing some closure, does not restore Bee's initial state of safety and trust. This pattern of starting in a relatively better state and ending in a worse state aligns with the **Riches to Rags** story arc type.\n\n4. **Determined Story Arc Type:**\n   Riches to Rags"

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Natalie. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. Natalie takes the pregnancy test, which diverges her life into two parallel realities.\n2. In one reality, Natalie gives birth to a daughter, Rosie, and struggles with coparenting, while in the other, she moves to Los Angeles to pursue her career in animation.\n3. Natalie experiences setbacks in both realities: in one, she faces difficulties with Gabe and her decision regarding their relationship and coparenting, and in the other, she faces criticism of her work and a failing long-distance relationship with Jake.\n4. Natalie has a career breakthrough in both realities, getting accepted into the South by Southwest film festival.\n5. The realities converge as Natalie, in both scenarios, ends up in a potentially positive romantic relationship, either with Gabe or reunited with Jake, and reflects on her life's outcome.\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Natalie's life is about to change significantly based on the pregnancy test result. Her state is one of uncertainty and anticipation.\n- **Event 2**: In both realities, Natalie faces new challenges. In one, she's a new mother dealing with the responsibilities and complexities of parenthood and coparenting with Gabe. In the other, she's navigating her career and relationships in a new city. Her state changes to one of adjustment and struggle.\n- **Event 3**: Natalie's state worsens as she faces specific setbacks. In the pregnancy reality, her discomfort with Gabe's engagement and her own life choices peaks. In the non-pregnancy reality, her career and relationship with Jake hit roadblocks. Her state is one of distress and self-doubt.\n- **Event 4**: With her career breakthrough, Natalie's state improves significantly. She experiences success and recognition in her field, which boosts her confidence and outlook. This is a turning point where her condition starts to improve.\n- **Event 5**: By the end, Natalie's state has improved in both realities. She's in a position of reflection, having navigated through her challenges and come out in a better place, with potential for a fulfilling relationship and a successful career. Her state is one of resolution and happiness.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on Natalie's condition throughout the story, we observe that she faces significant challenges and setbacks in both realities but ultimately ends up in a better state than where she began. This pattern does not fit the \"Rags to Riches\" story arc perfectly because Natalie's journey involves more than a simple improvement from a bad to a good state. It also doesn't fit \"Riches to Rags\" or \"Icarus\" because Natalie doesn't end up in a worse state than she started. The \"Cinderella\" story arc is close, but Natalie's story involves more complex ups and downs.\n\nThe story best fits the \"Double Man in a Hole\" arc because Natalie faces two cycles of dilemma and recovery in the parallel realities. In both paths, she falls into difficulties (becoming a mother and facing coparenting challenges in one, and facing career and relationship setbacks in the other) but finds a way out, ending in a better state than when she started each cycle. This arc type captures the essence of Natalie's dual journeys and her ultimate rise above her challenges.\n\n### 4. Determined Story Arc Type\n\nDouble Man in a Hole"

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Isabel, a 16-year-old girl who is fiercely independent and rebellious. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. Isabel decides to take a stand against Mason Stratton's reign of terror (sentence 5).\n2. Isabel slashes the tires of Mason Stratton's prized pickup truck (sentence 6).\n3. News of Isabel's courageous act sparks an uprising against Mason Stratton's tyrannical rule among her fellow students (sentence 9).\n4. Isabel and her team execute their plan to damage Mason's truck and escape, leading to a high-stakes chase (sentences 15-16).\n5. Walter unveils Mason's criminal alliances, leading to his immediate arrest, and Isabel's actions resolve the tension with her father (sentences 19-20).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Isabel is feeling frustrated and courageous, deciding to take a stand. Her state is one of determination and readiness for change.\n- **Event 2**: Isabel's state changes to one of action and potential danger as she confronts Mason Stratton's property. This is a risky move that could lead to repercussions.\n- **Event 3**: Isabel's courageous act inspires others, and her state improves as she gains support and becomes a leader. This marks a positive change in her condition.\n- **Event 4**: Isabel and her team face danger and tension during the execution of their plan and the subsequent chase. Her state becomes more precarious, with a higher risk of failure or harm.\n- **Event 5**: With Mason's arrest and the resolution of tension with her father, Isabel's state improves significantly. She achieves a sense of justice and reconciliation, ending in a better condition than she started.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the story. Initially, Isabel is in a state of frustration and rebellion, indicating a lower starting point. She then takes a courageous act against Mason, which sparks an uprising and improves her condition as she becomes a leader and inspires change. However, she faces setbacks and dangers, particularly during the confrontation and chase. Ultimately, she succeeds in her goals, resolves her issues with her father, and ends in a higher state than where she began.\n\nThis pattern follows the **Cinderella** story arc, where the protagonist rises, faces a setback, and ultimately achieves a higher state. Isabel's journey from a rebellious and frustrated teenager to a courageous leader who brings about change and resolves her personal conflicts fits this arc. She experiences growth and improvement in her condition from the beginning to the end, with challenges and setbacks along the way that she overcomes.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Xochitl, a young woman who is the central figure in the narrative, driving the plot forward with her actions and decisions related to environmental activism.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. **Xochitl's mother dies during a heat wave** (sentence 3), which motivates her to take more drastic action against environmental pollution.\n2. **The group devises a plan to detonate homemade explosives along an oil pipeline** (sentence 10), marking a significant escalation in their activism.\n3. **The group successfully blows up the pipeline** (sentence 19), which is the climax of their action and a moment of triumph for Xochitl and her companions.\n4. **Xochitl and Theo peacefully surrender** (sentence 27), indicating a shift from active rebellion to acceptance of consequences.\n5. **Theo dies shortly after being sentenced** (sentence 28), which is a tragic conclusion to the story, especially for Xochitl, who has lost a close friend and ally.\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1 (Xochitl's mother dies):** Xochitl's state is one of grief and frustration, motivated by the loss of her mother to environmental factors. This event sets her on a path of more radical action.\n- **Event 2 (Planning the pipeline explosion):** Xochitl's state is one of determination and planning, as she and her group prepare to take drastic action against the oil company. Her condition has shifted from grief to proactive engagement.\n- **Event 3 (The pipeline explosion):** Xochitl's state is one of triumph and fulfillment, having successfully executed their plan. This is a high point for her, as she feels she has made a significant statement and action against environmental pollution.\n- **Event 4 (Surrender):** Xochitl's state changes to one of resignation and acceptance, as she and Theo decide to surrender, acknowledging the legal consequences of their actions. This marks a downturn in her condition, as she must now face the repercussions of her actions.\n- **Event 5 (Theo's death):** Xochitl's state is one of loss and sadness, having lost a close friend and ally. This event further deteriorates her condition, leaving her not only in prison but also grieving.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the changes in Xochitl's condition throughout the story, we observe a pattern where she faces challenges (her mother's death, the struggle for environmental action), rises to a point of triumph (the successful sabotage), and then faces a significant downfall (surrender and Theo's death). This pattern does not fit the \"Rags to Riches\" or \"Cinderella\" arcs, as Xochitl's condition at the end is worse than at the beginning. It also doesn't fit \"Riches to Rags\" because Xochitl starts in a disadvantaged position and momentarily rises. The \"Man in a Hole\" arc is close, as Xochitl does fall into dilemmas and finds ways out, but the story's end, with Theo's death and Xochitl in prison, suggests a more complex pattern. The \"Icarus\" arc seems most fitting because Xochitl rises to a peak (the successful act of sabotage) but then falls significantly (surrender, prison, and Theo's death).\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To classify the story arc type, let's follow the instructions step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the protagonist and 5 major events in the story:**\n   - The protagonist can be considered as Hugo, given that the story revolves around his actions, emotions, and transformations.\n   - 5 major events in the story are:\n     1. Hugo's routine as an executioner is disrupted by Edmund's arrival (sentence 7).\n     2. Hugo starts to doubt Edmund's guilt and decides to investigate (sentence 9).\n     3. Hugo and Dupont uncover a secret linked to Edmund's accuser (sentence 17).\n     4. They gather evidence to clear Edmund's name and rush to stop the execution (sentences 19-22).\n     5. Edmund is vindicated, and the real culprit is exposed (sentence 24).\n\n2. **Describe the protagonist's state and how it changed relative to the previous events:**\n   - **Event 1 (Hugo's routine is disrupted):** Hugo's state is one of routine and possibly inner turmoil due to his job and social isolation. The arrival of Edmund introduces a new variable into his life.\n   - **Event 2 (Hugo starts to doubt Edmund's guilt):** Hugo's state changes to one of doubt and moral questioning. He begins to see the world differently, indicating a shift from his previous resigned state.\n   - **Event 3 (Uncovering a secret):** Hugo's state becomes more proactive and engaged. He is now committed to uncovering the truth, showing a significant change from his initial passive role as an executioner.\n   - **Event 4 (Rushing to stop the execution):** Hugo's state is one of urgency and determination. He is fully invested in saving Edmund, marking a peak in his proactive stance.\n   - **Event 5 (Edmund's vindication):** Hugo's state is one of relief and possibly vindication of his own moral compass. He has successfully challenged the system and helped an innocent man, which can be seen as an improvement from his initial state.\n\n3. **Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain the reasoning:**\n   - The story follows Hugo as he moves from a state of moral ambiguity and routine (as an executioner) to one of action and moral clarity. Initially, Hugo is in a \"hole\" due to his role and the doubts that arise with Edmund's case. As the story progresses, Hugo finds a way out of this dilemma by taking action, uncovering the truth, and ultimately saving Edmund. This journey from a lower state (moral ambiguity and inaction) to a higher state (moral clarity and proactive engagement) fits the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc. The protagonist falls into a dilemma (the moral questioning and investigation) and finds a way out (successfully saving Edmund and finding vindication), ending in a better state than where he began.\n\n4. **Determined story arc type:**\n   Man in a Hole"

Identify the protagonist and 5 major events in the story\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Quasi, the hunchback who attends work as a torturer. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n- Event 1: Quasi wins the papal drawing and becomes popular (sentence 4).\n- Event 2: Quasi is asked by King Guy to assassinate Pope Cornelius, which puts him in a difficult and dangerous situation (sentence 6).\n- Event 3: Quasi and Catherine concoct a plan after she learns that King Guy plans to kill Quasi after the assassination (sentences 10-12).\n- Event 4: Quasi is \"killed\" by Duchamp during the ceremony, but is actually whisked away to safety (sentence 13).\n- Event 5: Quasi and Catherine become the new rulers of France after the deaths of King Guy and Cornelius, and Quasi renews his friendship with Duchamp (sentence 28).\n\n### 2. Describe the protagonist's state and how it changed at each event\n\n- At Event 1, Quasi's state changes from being an outcast to being popular, which is an improvement in his condition.\n- At Event 2, Quasi's state worsens as he is faced with a moral dilemma and a threat to his life, which is a decline from his previous state.\n- At Event 3, Quasi's state slightly improves as he finds an ally in Catherine and a potential way out of his predicament, but he is still in danger.\n- At Event 4, Quasi's state appears to worsen as he is \"killed\" and has to go into hiding, but in reality, it is a temporary setback that ultimately leads to his safety.\n- At Event 5, Quasi's state significantly improves as he becomes one of the rulers of France and renews his friendship with Duchamp, which is a much better condition than where he started.\n\n### 3. Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain the reasoning\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on the pattern of the protagonist's condition throughout the story. Quasi starts in a disadvantaged situation, faces several challenges and setbacks, but ultimately ends up in a much better situation. This pattern matches the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc type, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma and finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning. The key characteristic of this arc is that the protagonist's condition improves from the first turning point to the last turning point, which is evident in Quasi's journey from being an outcast to becoming a ruler.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Alex, a jovial and quick-witted man from Mentone, a humble Georgian village. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. Sophia's arrival in Mentone with her ruby-red Ferrari (sentence 4).\n2. Alex decides to use Sophia's Ferrari for rip-roaring rides around the countryside, disregarding her meticulous guidelines (sentence 14).\n3. Alex experiences a pang of guilt and anxiety over the damage inflicted on Sophia's Ferrari and attempts to repair it (sentences 16 and 25).\n4. The whole village comes together to help Alex fix the luxury vehicle before Sophia's return (sentence 26).\n5. Sophia returns, and after initial disappointment, she understands and appreciates the efforts made by Alex and the village, deciding to stay in Mentone (sentences 29-34).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **Sophia's arrival**: Alex is in a state of curiosity and excitement, seeing an opportunity to work on a luxury car, which is a deviation from his usual tasks. His state is positive, filled with anticipation.\n\n2. **Using Sophia's Ferrari for rides**: Alex's state changes to one of excitement and mischief as he enjoys the thrill of driving the Ferrari. However, this action also sets the stage for future complications.\n\n3. **Experiencing guilt and attempting repairs**: Alex's state shifts to one of guilt and anxiety. He is faced with the dilemma of confessing his actions to Sophia and dealing with the consequences of damaging her property. His condition has worsened compared to the previous event.\n\n4. **Village helping to fix the Ferrari**: Alex's state remains anxious but also hopeful as he involves the village in fixing the car. There's a sense of community and support, which slightly improves his condition but still keeps him in a challenging situation.\n\n5. **Sophia's return and decision to stay**: Alex's state significantly improves as Sophia not only forgives him but also decides to leave her city life behind and stay in Mentone. This outcome is better than his initial state, as he has not only resolved his dilemma but also found love and a deeper connection with his community.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, the narrative follows a pattern where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (using Sophia's Ferrari without permission and damaging it) and then finds a way out of this situation (with the help of the village and Sophia's eventual understanding and love). Initially, Alex is in a good state, then his condition worsens as he faces the consequences of his actions, but ultimately, his state improves significantly as he resolves the dilemma and achieves a higher level of happiness and fulfillment.\n\nThis pattern aligns with the **Man in a Hole** story arc type, where the protagonist's condition improves from the first turning point to the last turning point, after falling into a hole or dilemma. The story shows Alex facing a problem, struggling with it, and then overcoming it to end up in a better situation than where he started.\n\n### 4. Determined Story Arc Type\n\nMan in a Hole"

Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **Initial Encounter**: Chris starts in a somewhat disadvantageous position, working at a car wash and having an embarrassing moment in front of his high school crush, Maria. His state is one of humiliation and unrequited love.\n2. **Decision to Adventure**: Chris's state improves as he decides to take action and pursue Maria to New York. He's determined and hopeful, showing a significant improvement from his initial state.\n3. **Road Trip Misadventures**: During the road trip, Chris faces numerous challenges and setbacks, including physical harm and the end of his friendship with Bud.

This shows a recovery from the previous low points.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the fluctuations in Chris's condition throughout the story, we see him start in a disadvantaged position, improve as he decides to take action, face significant setbacks during the road trip, hit a low point at the gallery, and then recover to a state of acceptance and bizarre harmony at the end. This pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (the embarrassing start and the misadventures), finds a way out (deciding to pursue Maria and the final performance), and ends better than at the beginning (finding acceptance and friendship despite the chaos).\n\nThe story arc that best fits this pattern is the **Man in a Hole**, as Chris falls into several dilemmas (embarrassment, misadventures, rejection) but manages to find a way out and ends in a better state than where he started, characterized by newfound friendships and a sense of adventure and acceptance.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Ellie, a 24-year-old woman who was adopted and is on a journey to discover her roots and reunite with her biological family.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. Ellie decides to meet her biological siblings face-to-face and return to her ancestral home in Japan (Event 5).\n2. Ellie's plans are disrupted by a destructive earthquake in her birth town, leading her to be rerouted to Tokyo (Event 7).\n3. Ellie meets Lily, a compassionate BBC Asia journalist, who helps her in her quest to uncover her roots (Event 11).\n4. Ellie discovers potential information about her birth parents and eventually reunites with them (Events 16 and 18).\n5. Ellie decides to reside in Tokyo to care for her birth parents and works on reuniting her dispersed family (Events 23 and 25).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- At Event 1, Ellie's state is one of yearning and longing for her roots. She is determined to meet her siblings and learn more about her past.\n- At Event 2, Ellie's plans are disrupted, and she is faced with uncertainty and possibly fear about what she will find in Tokyo instead of her intended destination. Her state has become more challenging and unpredictable.\n- At Event 3, Ellie meets Lily, which marks a positive turn in her journey. She now has support and help in navigating her quest, improving her state from one of solo struggle to having a supportive ally.\n- At Event 4, Ellie reunites with her birth parents, which is an emotionally charged experience. While it brings joy, it also reveals hardships and challenges her parents faced, leaving Ellie with a mix of emotions but a deeper understanding of her roots. Her state has evolved to include a sense of fulfillment and also possibly guilt or regret for not knowing her parents' situation sooner.\n- At Event 5, Ellie decides to take charge of her new reality by residing in Tokyo to care for her parents. This decision shows growth, responsibility, and a newfound sense of purpose. Ellie's state has transformed from one of seeking her roots to finding a way to contribute positively to her family's life, indicating a significant improvement in her condition.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the changes in Ellie's state throughout the story, we observe that she starts with a desire to connect with her roots, faces setbacks and challenges (such as the earthquake and the difficulties in finding her birth parents), but ultimately rises to a higher state of being through her reunions and her decision to care for her birth parents. This pattern of rising, facing a setback, and ultimately achieving a higher state aligns with the **Cinderella** story arc type. The Cinderella arc is characterized by the protagonist's journey from a lower state to a higher one, often with a temporary setback, which is exactly what Ellie experiences as she navigates her way to discovering her roots, facing challenges, and ultimately finding a new sense of purpose and belonging.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Freddie, a 25-year-old woman who was born in South Korea and adopted by French parents. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. Freddie arrives in Seoul and starts her journey of self-discovery and searching for her biological parents.\n2. Freddie meets her biological father and initially tries to build a relationship with him.\n3. Freddie's biological father becomes overly attentive, leading to Freddie feeling oppressed and pushing him away.\n4. Freddie meets her biological mother after years of searching and rejection, marking a significant turning point in her emotional journey.\n5. Freddie's email to her mother fails to deliver due to an invalid email address, but she finds solace in playing the piano, indicating a state of acceptance and happiness.\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Freddie is in a state of accidental discovery, open to new experiences but not actively seeking her biological parents. Her state is one of curiosity and openness.\n- **Event 2**: Freddie's state changes to one of cautious engagement with her biological father. She is trying to understand her roots and build a connection.\n- **Event 3**: Freddie feels overwhelmed and oppressed by her father's relentless attention. Her state shifts to one of discomfort and rejection.\n- **Event 4**: Meeting her biological mother brings Freddie to a state of emotional fulfillment and connection. She feels a sense of belonging and happiness.\n- **Event 5**: Despite the setback with the failed email, Freddie finds peace and happiness in playing the piano. Her state is one of acceptance and contentment.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. Initially, Freddie is in a neutral or somewhat uncertain state, which can be considered a middle ground rather than a clear high or low point. As she navigates her relationships with her biological parents, she experiences significant highs and lows. The meeting with her mother is a peak, followed by a minor setback with the email, but she ends on a note of personal fulfillment and happiness.\n\nGiven these fluctuations, the story does not follow a straightforward \"Rags to Riches\" or \"Riches to Rags\" arc, as Freddie's journey is more complex. The \"Man in a Hole\" arc is also not a perfect fit because Freddie's condition does not consistently improve after the first turning point. The \"Icarus\" arc does not apply since Freddie does not experience a drastic downfall at the end. The \"Cinderella\" arc could be considered due to Freddie's rise, setback, and ultimate achievement of a higher state, but it doesn't fully capture the complexity of her emotional journey and the multiple cycles of dilemma and recovery she undergoes.\n\nThe \"Oedipus\" arc, which involves a protagonist starting high, falling, recovering, and then facing another significant downfall, seems closest to Freddie's journey when considering her emotional highs and lows. However, upon closer examination, Freddie's story more accurately reflects a pattern of facing challenges, recovering, and growing, which aligns more with the \"Double Man in a Hole\" or a complex, nuanced version of the \"Cinderella\" story arc, given the ultimate rise to a higher state of emotional fulfillment and happiness.\n\n### 4.

        "input": "Story, broken down into numbered sentences:\n1) Jake, a retired army colonel scarred by the ravages of war, had secluded himself from the hustle and bustle of the world, choosing instead the tranquility of Sherwood Reserve, a dense, almost impenetrable forest.\n2) During one of his solo endeavors, he stumbles upon an antiquated, desolate station shrouded in forestry - its presence so discreet that it feels like a secret the woods have nurtured.\n3) Inspired by the allure of the unfamiliar, Jake begins exploring the derelict structure, its desolation adding a thrilling element to his mission.\n4) His investigation yields an unexpected discovery, an ancient silver talisman hidden beneath a decayed wooden floorboard.\n5) It glimmers ominously in the feeble sunlight filtering through the broken windows.\n6) Captivated by the talisman's design and apparent antiquity, Jake unsuspectingly tucks it into his pocket.\n7) The chill of the artifact against his hand and the faint pulsating energy emanating from it intrigue him, but he chooses to ignore these peculiarities, dismissing them as mere quirks.\n8) Not long after acquiring the mysterious talisman, Jake begins experiencing terrifying nightmares, each bone-chilling dream exponentially worse than the one before.\n9) These culminated in spectral whispers that seemed to reverberate within the shadows of his subconscious, a soft yet commanding voice gently enunciating his name, \"Jacob.\"\n10) From the corner of his eyes, he starts to perceive mystifying shadow figures.\n11) Quiet whispers with no clear source infiltrate his solitude, yet instantly disappear when he turns to search for them.\n12) Then, on a particularly frost-bitten night, a phantom voice rises from the depths of the forest.\n13) The chilling echo calls his name in a tone that grows progressively ominous and demanding, type of call that makes hair stand on end and breath stop short.\n14) But Jake, hardened by his military past, chooses to confront this unsettling mystery rather than abandon his chosen sanctuary.\n15) He takes it upon himself to uncover the root of these extraordinary occurrences, suspecting that they have something to do with the peculiar talisman he'd found.\n16) His inquisitive nature inspires him to delve into the artifact's history deeper, hoping to shed light on his disturbing experiences.\n17) The artifact’s origins reveal a dark history; it was once a symbol of supreme power wielded by an unholy spirit.\n18) History painted the spirit as a ruthless figure whose reign was filled with fear and untold suffering.\n19) Jake surmises that his action of displacing the talisman from its original resting place might've invoked a dormant, ghostly curse, thereby inviting a series of supernatural incidents that he now found himself in the midst of.\n20) After days spent pouring over obscure texts, he comes across an obscure reference, an arcane book that reveals the solution to his predicament.\n21) He must return the talisman to its hidden sanctuary within the dilapidated station.\n22) His resolution to end the supernatural terror is tested upon receiving an ominous call from a group of ruthless treasure hunters who seem to be on the talisman's trail, having sensed its phenomenal energy.\n23) Jake finds himself in the eye of two converging storms - one, a tangible threat posed by the relentless treasure hunters, and the other - the spectral terror that arises from the talisman's presence.\n24) His days devolve into carefully masking his movements from these treasure hunters, while relentlessly suffering nightmarish visions and mind games played by the malevolent spirit.\n25) Determined to overcome, Jake develops an elaborate plan to misdirect the marauders while simultaneously charting a path back to the station within the Sherwood Reserve, effectively orchestrating a return for the haunted talisman.\n26) Taking a deep breath, he embarks on his chilling mission back into the depths of the forest, his only companions being his undying courage and the vile artifact, a powerful, malevolent force resting ominously in his pocket.\n27) As he journeys deeper, he faces numerous phantom-led onslaughts from the treasure hunters.\n28) Their attacks are ruthless, revealing their desperation, and they resort to intimidation and mind manipulation to throw Jake off course.\n29) The malevolent spirit doesn't win him any respite either.\n30) It intensifies its mind-twisting renditions, inducing severe paranoia, making Jake question his reality, thereby testing his sanity to its breaking point.\n31) Engaged in a battle for survival, Jake utilizes every ounce of his military training and survival skills to outwit his foes while battling the mind-altering illusory world spun by the malignant spirit.\n32) The pressure from every quarrel strengthens his determination, fueling his mission to put an end to this cryptic nightmare once and for all by returning the talisman to the woeful station.\n33) Enhancing every step with grit and valor, Jake finally finds himself standing once again in the dreaded, haunted station, the relentless force of the curse palpable, its weight bearing down upon him.\n34) With hands trembling from exhaustion and nerves, he carefully positions the talisman under the dilapidated wooden floorboard from where he had retrieved it.\n35) He senses an immediate shift in the atmosphere, the ominous darkness ebbing away.\n36) As the ancient artifact securely reclaims its original spot, the wrathful spirit begins to dissolve into the ether, and the constant torment that has plagued Jake cease, giving him a hard-earned respite from the supernatural.\n37) Now free from the spectral horrors, he breathes a sigh of relief, laced with a hint of lingering anxiety.\n38) This exhalation echoes peacefully through the now tranquil forest, a poignant epitaph to his haunted journey.\n39) His journey victorious, Jake makes the solemn choice to leave behind Sherwood Reserve.\n40) Its horrific visions can now become distant memories.\n41) His thirst for adventure dampened by his unnerving encounters, he fosters an appreciation for mundanity that he'd previously scorned, choosing tranquility over adrenaline-fueled exploits.\n42) War-ridden and curse-challenged, his body craved a consistently peaceful, serene life away from the lurking specters and hidden horrors of the world.\n43) As Jake left the forest's embrace, the wind, now free of foreboding whispers, faintly sang a gentle farewell, the rustling leaves akin to a comforting lullaby: \"Wander away, noble warrior, to brighter places.\"\n44) He slid into his weathered Ford pickup, gripping the old steering wheel.\n45) His sigh, laden with relief and trepidation, filled the interior before he turned his back to the enigmatic forest forever, eager to leave behind its chilling memories.\n46) As his beloved truck carried him away from the forest's perimeters, he spent the journey reflecting on his nerve-wracking, supernatural trek and deciphering the profound lesson he'd learned; interfering with forces beyond human comprehension is best avoided.\n47) He yearned for a nondescript life, craving the welcome monotony he'd left behind when he'd shed his army uniform.\n48) This longing for an 'ordinary' existence overrode his adventure-seeking spirit.\n49) As Sherwood Reserve receded in his rearview, becoming a speck in the distance, he found a newfound resolution to reject his thrill-seeking past.\n50) He set his heart on a new beginning, determined to leave behind every shadow of his former life.\n51) Burying his haunted past, Jake focuses on his mundane daily routine, and contented himself with his newfound placid existence.\n52) Choosing calm over chaos and willingly exchanging horror-stricken nights for peaceful slumbers, Jake conceals his harrowing past beneath the promise of a hopeful future.\n53) Jake finds joy in ruminative strolls along the beach, kind sunsets, and the rhythms of everyday life, choosing peace over thrills.\n54) Underneath the soft lights of his new home, he let out a sigh of bliss, finally free of the fear and anxiety that had once threatened to consume him.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better (e.g., 0→1→2→4→10)\n- Riches to Rags: Protagonist starts high and ends lower (e.g., 10→9→8→6→0)\n- Man in a Hole: Protagonist falls into trouble but recovers (e.g., 6→2→1→4→10)\n- Icarus: Protagonist rises then falls dramatically (e.g., 2→4→9→5→1)\n- Double Man in a Hole: Two cycles of fall and recovery (e.g., 6→2→7→4→10)\n- Cinderella: Rise, setback, ultimate triumph (e.g., 1→7→4→1→10)\n- Oedipus: Start high, fall, recover, final fall (e.g., 10→4→7→9→1)",
        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\n\nThe protagonist in the story is Jake, a retired army colonel. Five major events in the story are:\n1. Jake finds the ancient silver talisman in the derelict station (sentence 4).\n2. Jake begins experiencing terrifying nightmares and spectral whispers (sentence 8).\n3. Jake discovers the dark history of the talisman and realizes he might have invoked a curse (sentence 19).\n4. Jake decides to return the talisman to its original place to end the supernatural terror (sentence 21).\n5. Jake successfully returns the talisman, ending the curse and finding peace (sentence 34).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Finding the Talisman):** Jake's state is one of curiosity and intrigue. He is drawn to the unknown and the adventure, indicating a sense of adventure-seeking and possibly a hint of recklessness. His condition is relatively stable and positive, as he is engaging in an activity that fascinates him.\n- **Event 2 (Experiencing Nightmares):** Jake's state deteriorates significantly. He is now plagued by terrifying nightmares and spectral whispers, indicating a decline in his mental and emotional well-being. His condition has worsened compared to the first event, as he is now experiencing fear and anxiety.\n- **Event 3 (Discovering the Curse):** Jake's understanding of his situation deepens, but his state remains troubled. He realizes the potential consequences of his actions, which adds to his anxiety and fear. However, this realization also marks a point of determination for him to find a solution, suggesting a slight improvement in his resolve but not in his overall condition.\n- **Event 4 (Deciding to Return the Talisman):** Jake's state shows a significant improvement in terms of determination and resolve. He takes control of his situation, deciding to confront the problem head-on. Although he is still under threat and experiencing supernatural terror, his condition in terms of mental resilience and determination improves.\n- **Event 5 (Successfully Returning the Talisman):** Jake's state improves dramatically. He succeeds in ending the curse, which immediately lifts the supernatural terror he was experiencing. This event marks a significant positive change in his condition, as he achieves peace and relief from the horrors he faced.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, the narrative follows a pattern where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (finding the cursed talisman and experiencing supernatural terror) and then finds a way out of it (by returning the talisman and ending the curse). Initially, Jake's condition worsens as he faces terrifying experiences, but as he takes action to resolve the issue, his condition improves, leading to a successful resolution of his problems. This pattern matches the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc type, where the protagonist's condition improves from the lowest point to a better state than at the beginning, due to their actions and determination.\n\n### 4.

This pattern resembles the **Oedipus** story arc, where the protagonist starts high, falls, recovers, and then faces another significant downfall. However, in Tomaz's case, it's more about starting low, rising, and then falling drastically. The key elements are the rise to a peak where Tomaz shows significant courage and determination, followed by a downfall that is worse than his initial state.\n\n### 4.

Description of Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Theft of the \"Portrait of a Young Man\")**: Carmen is in a high state, successfully stealing a valuable artifact, showcasing her skills and effortless evasion of security.\n- **Event 2 (Discovery of V.I.L.E's ploy)**: Carmen's state becomes one of concern and urgency upon learning of V.I.L.E's plan, marking a slight downturn as she realizes the gravity of the situation.\n- **Event 3 (Retrieval of artifacts and the chase)**: Carmen is in a state of action and danger, using her wits and abilities to evade capture, indicating a mix of high stakes and personal risk.\n- **Event 4 (Capture and revelation)**: This marks a significant low point for Carmen, as she and her companions are captured, and she learns that her efforts have been misguided due to the artifacts being fake.\n- **Event 5 (Final mission to disarm the ion cannon)**: Carmen's state improves dramatically as she devises and executes a plan to escape, disarm the ion cannon, and save the world, leading to a high point of success and triumph.\n\n### 3. Classification of Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, it can be observed that Carmen faces multiple challenges and setbacks (being pursued, captured, and learning the artifacts are fake) but ultimately overcomes them, leading to a successful outcome (disarming the ion cannon and saving the world). This pattern of facing dilemmas, falling into a difficult situation, and then recovering to achieve a positive outcome aligns with the **Double Man in a Hole** story arc type. The story features two main cycles of dilemma and recovery: the first being the pursuit and evasion, and the second being the capture and subsequent escape and victory over V.I.L.E.\n\n### 4.

Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Carmen learns about Zack and Ivy's kidnapping**: This is the inciting incident that sets the story in motion.\n2. **Carmen's attempt to rescue Zack and Ivy from the van**: This event shows Carmen's immediate reaction to the kidnapping and her willingness to take risks.\n3. **Carmen's decision to steal for V.I.L.E.**: This marks a turning point where Carmen decides to comply with V.I.L.E.'s demands in hopes of saving her friends.\n4. **Carmen's success or failure in stealing the requested items**: This event (or series of events) determines the progression of the story and the fate of Zack and Ivy.\n5. **Carmen's final attempt to rescue Zack and Ivy**: This is the climax of the story, where Carmen's decisions and actions lead to the conclusion.\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Carmen is in a state of urgency and concern for her friends. Her condition is one of disadvantage due to the kidnapping.\n- **Event 2**: If Carmen attempts to rescue Zack and Ivy and fails (as the van is a ploy), her condition worsens as she is forced to comply with V.I.L.E.'s demands, indicating a low point.\n- **Event 3**: By deciding to steal for V.I.L.E., Carmen's condition slightly improves as she sees a potential way to save her friends, though she is still in a difficult situation.\n- **Event 4**: The outcome of Carmen's missions (success or failure) directly affects her state. Successes improve her condition as she gets closer to saving Zack and Ivy, while failures worsen it, potentially leading to their brainwashing.\n- **Event 5**: In the final attempt, if Carmen succeeds in rescuing Zack and Ivy (especially with the help of trusted allies like Julia), her condition improves significantly, ending on a high note.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the progression of Carmen's condition throughout the story, it starts with a disadvantage (kidnapping of friends), falls to a lower point (failure in initial rescue attempt and being forced to work for V.I.L.E.), and then improves as Carmen navigates through the challenges and finally succeeds in rescuing her friends. This pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist faces a dilemma, finds a way out through their actions, and ends in a better state than at the beginning.\n\n### 4.

His condition is one of desire for change but lack of success.\n\n2. **Charter Trampled**: Bilgewater's plans are foiled, and the Charter is disrespected.

It doesn't fit \"Riches to Rags\" because Bilgewater doesn't start in a high-status position. It resembles the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc in the sense that Bilgewater falls into dilemmas, but the key difference is that he doesn't end up in a better state than when he started; instead, he faces a drastic downfall after a brief success. The closest match is the \"Icarus\" story arc, where the protagonist rises to success but then faces a drastic downfall. Bilgewater's story follows this pattern: he starts low, rises to briefly achieve his goal, and then falls to a lower point than where he started.\n\n### 4. Determined Story Arc Type\n\nIcarus"

Washington meets Martha Dandridge at Lincoln's funeral, and she urges him to continue the revolution (sentence 6-7).\n4. The team finally tracks down Arnold at a Vietnam bar, but he escapes (sentence 12).\n5. Washington and his team defeat Arnold in the final battle (sentence 30).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n- **Event 1**: At the beginning, Washington's state is one of loss and chaos as his fellow signatories are murdered, and the Declaration of Independence is stolen. This sets a low point for him.\n- **Event 2**: Washington's state changes to one of pursuit and failure as he chases Arnold but cannot kill him. This indicates a slight improvement in determination but a failure in action.\n- **Event 3**: Meeting Martha and deciding to continue the revolution marks a turning point where Washington's state improves as he gains a new ally and a reason to keep fighting. His condition starts to rise.\n- **Event 4**: Tracking down Arnold but failing to capture him keeps Washington in a state of pursuit and slightly heightened desperation. His condition is somewhat stable, with a focus on the mission.\n- **Event 5**: Finally defeating Arnold marks the highest point for Washington, where his condition significantly improves as he achieves his goal of stopping the traitor and saving the country.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\nGiven the progression of Washington's state:\n- He starts in a disadvantaged situation (loss and chaos).\n- He faces setbacks and failures (chasing Arnold, failing to capture him).\n- He experiences improvements and gains allies (meeting Martha, forming a team).\n- He ultimately achieves a significant victory (defeating Arnold).\n\nThis pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist rises from a low point to a high point, with setbacks along the way, but ultimately achieves success. However, upon closer examination, Washington's journey does not perfectly fit the \"Rags to Riches\" or \"Man in a Hole\" archetypes because his rise to success is not linear, and he faces significant challenges that threaten his progress.\n\nThe story arc that best fits Washington's journey is the \"Icarus\" type, but with an important distinction: Icarus typically involves a rise followed by a drastic fall. Washington's story, however, ends on a high note with his victory over Arnold and the establishment of America. This discrepancy suggests that the provided classification of \"Icarus\" might not fully capture the essence of Washington's storyline, which seems more aligned with a heroic rise and ultimate triumph.\n\n### 4.

their journey with trepidation, eventually discovering a labyrinth sprawling with more of these terrifying sea giants inhabiting the vast gloom.\n24) Dubbed as \"The Megalodon’s Den\", the crew came to realise the audacious marine world they were entangled within.\n25) Faced with a dangerous struggle for survival, they had to deal with limited oxygen reserves, encroaching water within the vessel, and the ever-pervasive dread of the circling megalodons, each second ticking away being a match against death.\n26) While attempting to salvage their vessel, Max and Zoe stumbled upon what seemed to be an unsanctioned deep-sea mining operation.\n27) The operation, run by Blackwater Industries, was ominously located within the deadly depths.\n28) Their worst fears were realised as they discovered that the mining activities were ruthlessly mutilating the delicate marine ecosystem, probably triggering the aggressive behaviour of the megalodons.\n29) Cornered by these ghastly realities and their primal fear of the undersea predators, Max and Zoe made a steadfast resolve – they would raise their voices against these atrocities.\n30) Risking the impending danger awaiting outside the Nautilus, they cautiously ventured out into the monstrous aquatic realm, embarking on a perilous mission to collect compelling evidence against Blackwater Industries' illicit operations.\n31) Back inside the Nautilus, the rest of the crew worked with renewed urgency and desperation, attempting to salvage their crippled vessel.\n32) Max and Zoe encountered numerous near-death experiences as they ventured deeper into the ocean, roving megalodons bordering their paths.\n33) However, they finally managed to land their hands on a significant amount of damning evidence against the mining operation.\n34) Their mission complete, they quickly swam back towards the safety of Nautilus, their hearts pounding as relentless predators gave chase.\n35) The following hours were marked with frantic struggles as the crew grappled in a suspenseful battle against the incensed megalodons.\n36) At the same time, they made desperate attempts to revive the operation of the battered Nautilus.\n37) Deciding to risk their final remaining reserves of oxygen, they managed to painfully coax the surviving engines back to life, just as their last breaths were threatening to slip away.\n38) Reactivating the propulsion system, the Nautilus shot upwards, barely evading the lethal jaws of a charging megalodon, a thrilling near-miss that left their hearts pounding.\n39) Breaking free to the world above the water, they took deep gasping breaths of fresh air, consumed by a combination of relief and shock from the nightmarish ordeal.\n40) Even in their weariness, Max and Zoe managed a triumphant smile, basking in their narrow victory against death.\n41) They didn't waste any time to procure the needed attention to their shocking discovery.\n42) With irrefutable evidence in hand, they exposed Blackwater Industries' illegal mining operations to international media.\n43) The revelation resulted in an international scandal, causing global outrage against the criminal corporation.\n44) The authorities were quick to respond, promptly shutting down all of Blackwater Industries’ unsanctioned operations.\n45) Encouraged by the unplumbed depths of the marine ecosystem discovered, the government approved explorations to scientifically study and protect 'The Megalodon’s Den.'\n46) Hailed as environmentalists and heroes, Max and Zoe spearheaded efforts towards the preservation of this newfound underwater sanctuary.\n47) As the curtain rolled down on their story, the scene cleverly shifted from the floating Poseidon into the depths of the Mariana trench.\n48) The audience was then taken on a hauntingly mesmeric underwater tour deep into an unexplored cavern.\n49) The path was eerily lit by an array of soft glows from bioluminescent creatures, the scene dwarfed by an overwhelming panoramic view of the massive cavern.\n50) The camera skillfully navigated the labyrinthine cavern, pausing at a particularly intriguing area.\n51) The eeriness of the cavern was suddenly shattered by a slow rustling sound.\n52) Illuminated by the faint bioluminescence, two gigantic eyes reflected in the camera, invoking a wave of chilling dread in the audience.\n53) The eyes blinked menacingly, emanating an ominous aura thick with suspense.\n54) As the glow from sea fauna glisten in the creature's eyes, a vast silhouette hinted at a marine creature dwarfing even the indomitable megalodons.\n55) Even with the recent publicity around the underwater ecosystem, the introduction of this new, more formidable creature hinted at a cascade of looming threats and unseen dangers.\n56) From Max and Zoe's impending battle against more environmental infractions to the terrifying lurking leviathan, the audience was left gripping their seats in anticipation.\n57) The narrative ended on a high note, embedding the tantalizing impression of another adrenaline-charged encounter of 'The Megalodon’s Den'.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better (e.g.,

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Max, who was once an intrepid explorer and is now an environmental celebrity. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. Max receiving the extraordinary proposition from Dmitry Blackwood to explore the Mariana Trench.\n2. The team's descent into the Mariana Trench, where they encounter breathtaking bioluminescence and prehistoric creatures.\n3. The attack by the enormous megalodon that severely cripples their submarine, stranding them.\n4. The discovery of the unsanctioned deep-sea mining operation by Blackwater Industries and the decision to gather evidence against it.\n5. The team's successful escape from the depths and their exposure of Blackwater Industries' illegal operations to the international media.\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **Event 1:** Max is feeling a sense of detachment from his past life of adventure, yearning for something more exhilarating. His state is one of stagnation and longing for change.\n2. **Event 2:** As Max descends into the Mariana Trench, he is filled with excitement and a sense of adventure reignited. His state improves significantly as he is once again engaged in the kind of exploration he loves.\n3. **Event 3:** After the megalodon attack, Max's state worsens. He and his team are in a desperate fight for survival, facing numerous dangers including the aggressive megalodons, limited oxygen, and a crippled submarine.\n4. **Event 4:** Upon discovering the illegal mining operation, Max's state becomes one of determination and purpose. He decides to take action against the environmental atrocity, which adds a layer of risk but also gives him a clear goal to work towards.\n5. **Event 5:** After successfully escaping and exposing the illegal operations, Max's state is one of triumph and relief. He has overcome the dangers and achieved his goal, ending in a better state than where he began.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on Max's condition throughout the story, the narrative follows a pattern where the protagonist starts in a state of longing for adventure (a kind of emotional low), then faces a series of challenges and dangers (a fall into a dilemma), and finally emerges victorious and in a better state than at the beginning (a rise out of the dilemma). This pattern aligns with the **Man in a Hole** story arc type, where the protagonist falls into a difficult situation but ultimately finds a way out, ending in a better condition than at the start.\n\nThe reasoning behind this classification is as follows:\n- Max starts in a less desirable state (yearning for adventure and feeling detached from his past life), which can be considered a \"hole\" or a low point.\n- He then embarks on a journey that initially fulfills his desire for adventure but soon turns into a series of dangerous and challenging situations (the attack by the megalodon, the discovery of the illegal mining operation, and the struggle to survive and gather evidence).\n- Despite these challenges, Max and his team manage to overcome them, achieve their goal of exposing the illegal mining operation, and emerge as heroes. This outcome places Max in a significantly better state than where he started, both in terms of personal fulfillment and external recognition.\n\n### 4. Determined Story Arc Type\n\nMan in a Hole"

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Jane, a girl who relocates from rural Ireland to New York City with her parents. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. Jane's initial struggle to adapt to Manhattan High and her discovery of the school library as a sanctuary (sentences 1-4).\n2. The formation of an unusual kinship with Sam and Megan in the library, away from judgment (sentences 5-7).\n3. Jane's attempt to infiltrate the popular group, including a disco night debacle and subsequent planning with Sam and Megan (sentences 8-12).\n4. A series of trials and tribulations, including a baking disaster, a dance marathon, and a brutal rejection from Derek, which leads to Jane realizing the importance of being true to herself (sentences 13-16).\n5. Jane's decision to celebrate her individuality, challenging Derek to a dance-off, and ultimately finding acceptance and romance without sacrificing her unique spirit (sentences 17-26).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Jane is overwhelmed and struggling to adapt to her new environment. Her state is one of discomfort and disorientation.\n- **Event 2**: Jane finds solace in the library and forms friendships with Sam and Megan. Her state improves as she finds a sense of belonging and acceptance among her new friends.\n- **Event 3**: Jane attempts to fit into the popular crowd, which initially excites her but ends in embarrassment. Her state becomes one of confusion and slight desperation to be accepted.\n- **Event 4**: After facing rejection and realizing her mistakes, Jane begins to understand the value of being herself. Her state transitions from one of trying to conform to an initial awareness of self-acceptance.\n- **Event 5**: Jane embracing her individuality leads to her outdoing Derek in a dance-off, finding acceptance, and experiencing a budding romance. Her state improves significantly as she gains confidence, acceptance, and happiness.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on Jane's condition throughout the story, it's clear that she starts in a disadvantaged or uncomfortable situation (struggling to adapt to a new city and school) and ends in a much better situation (finding acceptance, romance, and confidence in being herself). This trajectory matches the **Rags to Riches** story arc type, where the protagonist's condition improves from the beginning to the end. Jane's journey involves overcoming challenges, learning valuable lessons about self-acceptance, and ultimately achieving a higher state of happiness and social acceptance without losing her unique identity.\n\n### 4.

This pattern aligns with the **Cinderella** story arc, where the protagonist faces challenges, overcomes them, and ultimately achieves a higher state of being than where they started. The key elements here are the initial desire for change, the rise to popularity, the drastic fall into a coma, and the eventual recovery and surpassing of the initial goal through personal growth and self-acceptance.\n\n### 4.

His state improves as he finds a new sense of direction.\n- **At Event 3 (Encountering Molly)**: Meeting Molly reflects Arthur's past and his decision to fulfill the promise. This encounter doesn't necessarily improve or worsen his state but adds depth to his journey, showing him the cyclical nature of life and decisions.\n- **At Event 4 (Reinstating the Vow)**: Arthur finds contentment and peace after reinstating his vow. This marks a significant improvement in his state, as he achieves closure and fulfills his long-held promise.\n- **At Event 5 (Return and Passing)**: Arthur returns home transformed and at peace, which shows an improvement in his state compared to the turmoil he experienced at the beginning of his journey.

Initially, Arthur is in a state of tranquility, which is disrupted by the letter. He then embarks on a journey of self-discovery and fulfillment, facing challenges but ultimately finding peace and contentment. This pattern indicates that the protagonist falls into a dilemma (the disruption of his peaceful life by the forgotten promise) and then finds a way out (by fulfilling the promise and finding peace), ending in a better state than where he began.\n\n### 4.

from an old work colleague, Queenie Hennessy, reveals she is dying from cancer and is living in a hospice in Berwick-upon-Tweed.\n3) Penning a perfunctory response, he complains that the words he has written are not enough of a response but, lacking ideas, he goes to post them anyway.\n4) Finding himself still reluctant to release the letter he continues walking into town, passing multiple opportunities to send the letter, before finding himself in a petrol garage where the attendant tells him that her support helped her aunt fight back against her own cancer.\n5) Inspired, he calls the hospice and asks them to tell Queenie that he intends to walk to Berwick - some 500 miles - and she must hold onto her life until he arrives.\n6) Realising Harold is not returning, Maureen is at first worried, then when he calls her to inform her of his plan, she reacts angrily.\n7) Eventually, she reveals to her neighbour Rex that following several years of rocky relationship, she fears he has taken the opportunity to finally walk out on their marriage - something she admits she had almost done numerous times in the past.\n8) After several days of travel, Harold begins to suffer flashbacks and hallucinations of his son, David.\n9) Suffering a tempestuous relationship, in his early adult years David spurned Harold's parenting and their relationship broke down.\n10) After collapsing in the road, Harold is taken in by Martina, a Slovakian doctor who emigrated to the UK but is now unable to find any other work than cleaning.\n11) She treats his feet, which are now covered in sores and infected blisters, and allows him to recuperate in her house for several days.\n12) Meanwhile she reveals that her partner left her for another woman a year ago, and she still waits for him to return every day.\n13) Though Harold does not feel himself equal to her hospitality, she tells him that his story refusal to accept bitter truths lying down humbles her, and she sends him on his way with several pieces of walking kit left by her former partner.\n14) Harold's journey continues for several weeks, with Harold continuing to meet strangers and humble them with his selfless spirit.\n15) Stopping for a drink in a pub, one patron asks to take his picture as a keepsake.\n16) The photo makes its way to the media and he rapidly becomes a national sensation, though Harold has no knowledge of the story.\n17) Shortly after, Harold is joined by Wilf, an eighteen-year-old junkie who was inspired by his story and wants to walk to save Queenie too.\n18) As more media outlets pick up the story, several dozen more individuals join him and collectively adopt the moniker of 'Pilgrim', though Harold seems bemused by their presence and struggles to understand why they are fascinated by him.\n19) Maureen and Rex also travel up to visit Harold, though when Harold invites Maureen to join his walk she responds in frustration that she is unable to let go of the things holding her back in the way he has.\n20) The camp, though continuing to grow and fostering a genuine camaderie amongst the Pilgrims, slowly becomes something of a circus and is by now making barely any progress towards Berwick.\n21) Harold's memories of his son continue, and after Wilf flees the camp after being caught raiding Harold's supplies and carrying pills, Harold recalls David's own descent into drug-taking.\n22) In a discussion with another Pilgrim he tells her of how he watched his son deteriorate before he took his own life in their garage.\n23) The Pilgrim helps Harold to accept that he needs to leave the camp behind to reach his destination.\n24) Now alone, Harold's mental state declines as he fears the end of the journey will result in the same loss as he suffered with David, and he eventually phones Maureen from a phone booth to tell her that he has no idea where he is and that he wants to come home.\n25) Maureen, having had time to come to terms with her own feelings, instead informs him that he is only 18 miles from Berwick and that he must finish his journey.\n26) She also reveals to him that she never passed on Queenie's final message to him some 25 years earlier.\n27) Believing that he was to blame for David's death and the resulting near-collapse of his marriage, Harold had turned to drink and had determined to engineer ways of punishing himself further.\n28) He had therefore driven to his place of work at night and destroyed much of their stock, intending on being fired for his actions.\n29) Instead, Queenie had found him first and had taken the blame for the damage, being dismissed in his place but allowing him to rebuild his life.\n30) Some time later she had driven to Harold and Maureen's house while he was out to tell him that she was moving away and to tell him not to blame himself for everything that had come to pass.\n31) Maureen, feeling spiteful for the way that he was receiving comfort where she had none and perhaps suspecting an affair, had refused to pass on the message, but finally lets him hear it.\n32) Shortly afterwards, Harold reaches Berwick.\n33) He initially struggles to summon the nerve to enter the hospice but when he does, then he is enthusiastically greeted by the nun he has spoken to on the phone on several occasions, who leads him in to greet Queenie but warns him that she is no longer able to speak.\n34) Something of a taciturn man, Harold finds himself unable to say much to her but hangs up a quartz pendant that he has brought from near the start of his journey in her window.\n35) When meeting Maureen again in Berwick, Harold confesses defeat, implying that Queenie did not live long after his arrival and telling Maureen that he doesn't understand how he thought that he could save her when he could not save David.\n36) She responds by telling him that his devotion to Queenie has helped her remember the man she used to love and that his actions have saved their marriage.\n37) Meanwhile, the various people who Harold and his story touched along the pilgrimage are shown looking at light reflected around them, and smiling.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist

Harold decides to walk to Berwick-upon-Tweed after receiving a letter from Queenie Hennessy, who is dying of cancer.\n2. Harold meets Martina, a Slovakian doctor, who helps him recover from his journey and shares her own story of heartbreak.\n3. Harold becomes a national sensation, and many people join him on his walk, adopting the moniker \"Pilgrim.\"\n4. Harold has a breakdown and calls Maureen, telling her he wants to come home, but she encourages him to finish his journey.\n5. Harold finally reaches Berwick-upon-Tweed and visits Queenie in the hospice.\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **Initial Decision to Walk**: Harold's state is one of inspiration and determination. He feels the need to do something for Queenie and decides on this extraordinary journey. This marks a significant change from his sedentary life, indicating an improvement in his condition as he takes action.\n\n2. **Meeting Martina**: Harold's physical state is poor due to the hardships of his journey, but meeting Martina improves his mental and physical condition. She helps him recover, and her story humbles him, showing that his selfless act has inspired others. This event further improves Harold's condition as he finds support and connection.\n\n3. **Becoming a National Sensation**: Harold's state is one of confusion and bemusement as he struggles to understand why so many people are drawn to his story and want to join him. While this brings him more support, it also introduces chaos and distraction from his original goal. His condition could be seen as plateauing or slightly declining due to the loss of focus on his personal journey.\n\n4. **Breakdown and Calling Maureen**: Harold's state is at its lowest. He is mentally and physically exhausted, fearing the outcome of his journey and feeling overwhelmed by the responsibility and attention. This marks a significant decline in his condition as he faces his deepest fears and feels lost.\n\n5. **Visiting Queenie**: Harold's state is one of sadness and acceptance. He finally reaches Queenie but finds her unable to speak. Despite the sadness, there's a sense of completion and fulfillment of his promise. His condition improves slightly from the low point of his breakdown, as he finds closure and learns valuable lessons about himself and his relationships.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the analysis, Harold starts in a relatively low state (sedentary life, troubled past), improves as he embarks on his journey and meets supportive people, faces a significant decline as he struggles with the consequences of his newfound fame and personal demons, and then slightly improves as he finds closure and learns from his experiences. This pattern resembles the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (Harold's breakdown and fears) and then finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning (Harold finds closure, and his actions positively impact his marriage).\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To classify the story arc type, let's first identify the protagonist and 5 major events in the story.\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Olivia Sterling, as the story revolves around her emotional journey and character development.\n\nHere are 5 major events in the story:\n\n1. **Olivia's introduction and plea for help**: Olivia appears in Jack's life, desperate for help in finding her missing boyfriend, Adrian (sentence 2).\n2. **The discovery of a potential crime**: A movie prop surfaces at a chilling murder location, indicating that Adrian's disappearance might be connected to something more sinister (sentence 7).\n3. **Olivia's commitment to aid Jack**: Olivia decides to help Jack in his investigation, despite the dangers and uncertainties (sentence 10).\n4. **The rescue of Adrian**: Olivia and Jack find Adrian in the clutches of the Mafia and manage to alert the police, leading to Adrian's rescue (sentences 13-15).\n5. **The aftermath and Olivia's newfound strength**: Olivia grapples with the consequences of Adrian's deceit but finds hope and inspiration in Jack's integrity, leading to a newfound respect and appreciation for her own inner strength (sentences 16-20).\n\nNow, let's analyze the protagonist's state at each event and how it changed relative to the previous events:\n\n1. At the first event, Olivia is desperate and pleading for help, indicating a low point in her emotional state.\n2. At the second event, Olivia's state worsens as she faces the frightening possibility that Adrian might be involved in something criminal.\n3. At the third event, Olivia's state begins to improve as she finds the courage to commit to aiding Jack, taking an active role in the investigation.\n4.

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\n\nThe protagonist in the story is Philip Marlowe, a private detective. Five major events in the story are:\n1. Marlowe is hired by Clare Cavendish to find her missing lover, Nico Peterson (sentence 1).\n2. Marlowe discovers that Peterson is supposedly dead, but then learns that Cavendish has seen him after his supposed death (sentences 2 and 4).\n3. Marlowe convinces his friend, homicide detective Joe Green, to open a murder investigation, and they begin to unravel the mystery surrounding Peterson's death (sentence 7).\n4. Marlowe is taken by drug lord Lou Hendricks and learns that Peterson was a drug courier who stole a large amount of cocaine, and that his death was faked with the help of the Corbata Club (sentence 19).\n5. Marlowe Finally confronts the truth, and after a series of events, Peterson is killed by Cavendish, who betrays him to protect her own interests and relationship with O'Reilly (sentence 34).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Marlowe's state is neutral; he is hired for a job. His condition is unchanged as he begins his investigation.\n- **Event 2**: Marlowe's state becomes one of intrigue and slight frustration due to the new information. His condition has slightly worsened because the case has become more complex.\n- **Event 3**: Marlowe's state improves as he makes progress in the investigation, getting the police involved. His condition has improved relative to the previous event because he is making headway.\n- **Event 4**: Marlowe's state worsens as he is taken by Hendricks and faces danger. His condition has deteriorated significantly because he is now in physical danger and deeper in the mystery.\n- **Event 5**: Marlowe's state improves again as he witnesses the final confrontation and makes a decision not to betray Cavendish, despite her actions. His condition has improved because he has resolved the case, albeit not in a traditional sense of justice, and maintained his integrity.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on Marlowe's condition throughout the story, it seems to follow a pattern where he faces challenges, recovers, and then faces another set of challenges before ultimately ending in a better state than when he started, considering he has solved the mystery and maintained his personal integrity. This pattern suggests a story arc that involves a rise, a fall, and then another rise, which is characteristic of the Cinderella story arc type. The Cinderella arc involves a protagonist who rises, faces a setback, and ultimately achieves a higher state, which aligns with Marlowe's journey from being hired for a mysterious case, facing complications and dangers, and eventually resolving the case on his own terms.\n\n### 4.

She notices a Buick tailing her, which introduces fear and tension into her journey (Sentence 2).\n3. The appearance of unsettling images and the voice of a woman in her mirror, reminiscent of her deceased mother, escalates her fear and introduces a supernatural element (Sentences 6 and 7).\n4.

        "output": "To analyze the story arc, let's first identify the protagonist and key events.\n\n1. **Protagonist Identification and Major Events:**\n   - The protagonist of the story can be considered as Deputy Sheriff Joe \"Deke\" Deacon, given that the narrative revolves significantly around his actions, backstory, and emotional state.\n   - Five major events in the story are:\n     1. Deacon is sent to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department to collect evidence (sentence 3), marking his entry into the new case.\n     2. Deacon notices similarities between the current murder and an old serial murder case he was unable to solve (sentence 6), which sparks his obsession.\n     3. The FBI is set to take over the investigation (sentence 17), increasing pressure on Deacon and Baxter.\n     4. Deacon and Baxter's illegal search of Sparma's apartment (sentence 21) leads to complications and raises the stakes.\n     5. The final confrontation where Baxter kills Sparma (sentence 30), and the aftermath where Deacon advises Baxter to forget the case (sentence 34), conclude the main conflict.\n\n2. **Protagonist's State at Each Event:**\n   - **Event 1:** Deacon is in a professional, somewhat stable state, being tasked with collecting evidence.\n   - **Event 2:** His state becomes more intense and possibly obsessive as he connects the current case to his past failure, indicating a slight decline in his emotional well-being due to the resurgence of unresolved issues.\n   - **Event 3:** The pressure from the FBI's impending involvement adds stress, potentially lowering his state further as he feels the need to solve the case before it's taken away from him.\n   - **Event 4:** The illegal search and its consequences put Deacon in a risky and compromised position, both professionally and personally, marking a significant downfall.\n   - **Event 5:** After the confrontation and the advice to Baxter, Deacon seems to be in a reflective state, having ensured that the case is closed in his own way, but also haunted by his past and the events of the story, suggesting a complex mix of resolution and lingering personal issues.\n\n3. **Story Arc Classification:**\n   - The story arc of \"Oedipus\" is characterized by a protagonist who starts high, falls, recovers, and then faces another significant downfall. In Deacon's case, he begins in a position of authority and stability (high), becomes obsessed and risks his profession (fall), seems to find a way to deal with his past through the investigation (recovery), but ultimately ends up covering up a murder and is haunted by his past actions (another downfall).\n   - This pattern fits because Deacon's journey is marked by his inability to escape his past mistakes and obsessions, leading to a series of events that ultimately result in him being in a worse state than where he began, both morally and emotionally.\n\n4. **Determined Story Arc Type:**\nOedipus"

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is John, a battle-weary veteran and the owner of a lottery shop in the town of Haven. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. John feels disillusioned and restless with his life, considering selling his shop (sentence 1).\n2. John learns about eerie, cryptic messages on the lottery terminals and the disappearance of the recent lottery winner (sentence 8).\n3. John is plagued by disturbing dreams and visions, realizing he might have stirred a sinister entity (sentence 13).\n4. John discovers the long-forgotten secret of Haven and the malevolent spirits haunting the lottery winners (sentence 20).\n5. John successfully traps the spirits back into the machine, restoring peace to the town (sentence 30).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: John is feeling disillusioned and restless, indicating a low point in his life. He is considering a significant change by selling his shop, showing dissatisfaction with his current state.\n- **Event 2**: John's state becomes more concerned and possibly fearful as he learns about the strange occurrences and disappearances. This is a further decline from his initial restlessness.\n- **Event 3**: John is now overwhelmed with dread and guilt, realizing his actions might have caused harm to others. This marks a significant low point for John, both emotionally and in terms of his sense of responsibility.\n- **Event 4**: John's state begins to shift as he gains understanding and determination. He moves from being a victim of circumstances to becoming an active participant in solving the mystery and saving his town. This can be seen as the beginning of his recovery.\n- **Event 5**: John successfully overcomes the challenges, saves his town, and decides to stay, indicating a significant improvement in his state. He has found a new appreciation for his life in Haven and has grown from his experiences.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, it can be observed that John starts in a state of dissatisfaction and restlessness, falls into a deeper dilemma as the supernatural events unfold, and then finds a way out by solving the mystery and saving his town. This pattern indicates that the story follows a specific arc where the protagonist faces a challenge, hits a low point, and then recovers to a better state than where he started.\n\nThe protagonist's journey from feeling disillusioned and restless to facing and overcoming a significant supernatural threat, and finally finding a new appreciation for his life, suggests a story arc that involves a fall into a problem and a rise to a solution, ending in a better state than the beginning.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To classify the story arc type, let's first identify the protagonist and major events in the story.\n\n1. **Identify the protagonist and major events:**\n   - The protagonist of the story is not clearly a single character throughout but seems to focus on the community of Oak Springs, particularly characters like Lupita, Dolores, and Caleb, who are central to the unfolding events. For the purpose of analysis, we'll consider Lupita as a key character whose state we can track throughout the story.\n   - Major events:\n     1. Mario's death and the transformation of the bingo hall into a casino under Mr. Big's management.\n     2. The community's initial success and winnings at the casino, notably Dolores's daughter-in-law Raquel and later Clarence.\n     3. The realization that something is terribly wrong, as characters start to suffer bizarre and fatal accidents, such as Clarence's death.\n     4. Lupita's discovery of the truth and her attempt to rescue the community, including finding Clarence's body and seeing Morris's interaction with Mr. Big.\n     5. The final confrontation where Lupita, Caleb, and the community fight back against Mr. Big, leading to his demise and their escape.\n\n2. **Describe the protagonist's state and changes:**\n   - **Event 1:** At the beginning, Lupita is introduced as part of the community, seemingly living a normal life. Her state is neutral or even positive.\n   - **Event 2:** As the community starts winning at the casino, Lupita's state, by association, seems to improve. The community is excited and benefiting from the new establishment.\n   - **Event 3:** With the bizarre accidents and deaths, Lupita's state deteriorates. She becomes aware of the sinister forces at play and starts to investigate, indicating a decline in her well-being and safety.\n   - **Event 4:** Lupita's discovery of the truth about Mr. Big and the casino's influence over the community puts her in a state of urgency and danger. Her condition worsens as she realizes the extent of the problem.\n   - **Event 5:** In the final confrontation, Lupita's state improves as she and the community successfully defeat Mr. Big, escaping his control and the casino's influence. This indicates a recovery from the previous low point.\n\n3. **Classify the story arc type:**\n   - Given the protagonist's (Lupita's) condition throughout the story, we see an initial neutral or positive state, followed by a temporary improvement, then a significant decline as the sinister nature of the casino is revealed and the community suffers, and finally, an improvement as the community fights back and prevails.\n   - This pattern does not fit the **Rags to Riches** arc, as the improvement is not linear and faces significant setbacks.\n   - It doesn't fit **Riches to Rags** either, as the story does not end with the protagonist in a significantly lower state than the beginning.\n   - The **Man in a Hole** arc is closer, as Lupita falls into a dilemma (discovering the sinister forces and their impact on the community) and finds a way out (defeating Mr. Big and freeing the community).\n   - The story also has elements of **Cinderella**, with a rise (initial success at the casino), a setback (realization of the danger and tragic events), and ultimately achieving a higher state (freedom from Mr. Big's control).\n\n4. **Determined story arc type:**\n   - **Man in a Hole**"

        "output": "### 1. Identification of Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonists of the story are Jack and Leo, but for the purpose of analyzing the story arc, we can consider their collective journey as the focus, with an emphasis on Jack's character development due to his more pronounced emotional and situational changes throughout the story.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. Jack receives an invitation to Leo's 30th birthday party and decides to attend (Event 4).\n2. Jack and Leo's reconnection at the birthday party is initially strained (Event 6).\n3. Jack reveals his unresolved fear of flights to Leo, which sparks a heart-to-heart conversation (Event 9).\n4. The duo successfully retrieves the stolen Basquiat painting after a chase (Event 11).\n5. The film concludes with Jack and Leo's birthday celebration, where they make peace and promise to stay connected (Event 13).\n\n### 2. Description of Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1 (Invitation to Leo's party):** Jack's state is one of nostalgia and possibly disconnection from his past, indicated by his decision to attend the party. This event sets him on a path of reconnection with his past and with Leo.\n- **Event 2 (Strained reconnection):** Jack's state is tense and uncertain, as he and Leo struggle to reconnect. This represents a low point in their relationship and in Jack's emotional state, as he is forced to confront the distance and differences that have developed between them.\n- **Event 3 (Revelation of fear):** Jack's state is vulnerable, as he opens up about his fear of flights and its connection to Leo. This marks a turning point where Jack begins to confront and resolve past issues, leading to a potential for growth and healing.\n- **Event 4 (Successful retrieval of the painting):** Jack's state is one of triumph and camaraderie, as he and Leo work together to achieve a common goal. This event symbolizes their renewed friendship and Jack's ability to face challenges alongside Leo.\n- **Event 5 (Celebration and making peace):** Jack's state is one of resolution, peace, and renewed connection with Leo. This final state is better than his initial state, as he has reconciled with his past, resolved a longstanding issue with Leo, and reaffirmed their friendship.\n\n### 3. Classification of Story Arc Type\n\nThe story follows a pattern where the protagonist (Jack, and collectively Jack and Leo) faces a dilemma or a low point (their strained reconnection and Jack's unresolved fear) but ultimately finds a way out and ends in a better state than at the beginning (their renewed friendship and personal growth). This pattern matches the **Man in a Hole** story arc type, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma and then finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning. The key elements that support this classification are the initial disconnection and tension between Jack and Leo, the revelation and resolution of Jack's fear, and the eventual triumph and peace they achieve together.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\nThe protagonist of the story is Sonny. Five major events in the story are:\n- Event 1: Sonny's decision to attend Huck's birthday celebration after initial reluctance (sentence 7).\n- Event 2: Sonny wards off a mountain lion with an EpiPen and earns the nickname \"Big Dog\" (sentence 13).\n- Event 3: The confrontation with Stan, Huck's loan shark, leads to Sonny's finger being broken, and the party site being burned down (sentence 18).\n- Event 4: Sonny offers his house for Huck's birthday celebration, which escalates into a rager (sentence 24).\n- Event 5: Sonny's family leaves him due to the out-of-control party, and he later apologizes and starts making amends (sentences 27-29).\n\n### 2. Analyzing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n- **Event 1**: Sonny's state changes from boredom and loneliness to excitement and engagement as he decides to join Huck's celebration. Initially, he was stuck in a routine, but this event marks a shift towards seeking adventure and reconnection with his past.\n- **Event 2**: Sonny's state improves significantly as he successfully defends himself against a mountain lion, earning respect and a new nickname. This event boosts his confidence and sense of capability.\n- **Event 3**: Sonny's state worsens as he faces violence and the destruction of the party site. This event introduces conflict and sets back Sonny's positive trajectory.\n- **Event 4**: Sonny's state appears to improve as he finds a way to continue the celebration and reconnect with Huck and potentially others. However, this event also sets the stage for future conflict, as the party's escalation will eventually lead to trouble with his family.\n- **Event 5**: Sonny's state hits a low point as his family leaves him, and he is forced to confront the consequences of his actions. This event marks a turning point towards recovery and making amends.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\nThe story arc type can be classified by examining the overall trend of the protagonist's condition throughout the story. Initially, Sonny is in a stable but unfulfilling state (being a stay-at-home dad), then he seeks adventure and experiences highs (earning the nickname \"Big Dog\") and lows (conflict with the loan shark, party getting out of control). The key to identifying the story arc is recognizing that despite some moments of improvement, Sonny's overall condition at the end is not significantly better than at the beginning; in fact, he faces a significant downfall (his family leaving him) before starting to make amends. This pattern does not fit \"Rags to Riches\" or \"Cinderella\" because Sonny does not end in a significantly better state. It also does not fit \"Riches to Rags\" because Sonny does not start in a high-status position. The pattern resembles \"Man in a Hole\" because Sonny falls into dilemmas (boredom, conflict, family trouble) and finds ways out, but the overall trajectory is more complex due to the multiple cycles of dilemma and recovery.\n\n### 4.

primary goal was to ensure Zephyr's survival and preserve his bloodline by sending him to Earth, a thriving and prosperous planet teeming with life forms diverse in every conceivable way.\n6) Before the momentous departure, King Argo and Queen Ellara placed a powerful cosmic pendant, \"The Heart of Zadaar,\" within their little heir.\n7) The pendant was more than a symbolic object; it granted

securely nestled in embarked on its perilous journey across star-filled galaxies.\n9) A daunting and adventurous travel to an unknown planet, Earth.\n10) After surviving the dangers of interstellar

baby.\n15) They rebranded him as Sean, providing him an earthly identity, yet they unknowingly harbored a royal alien in their humble Kansas home.\n16) As time swept by, Sean, nurtured with immense love and care by his doting adoptive Kansas parents, matured into a seemingly unexceptional teenager, blending perfectly into the predictable rhythm of the town.\n17) In contrast to his outwardly normal life, an inner turmoil brewed within Sean as he struggled to comprehend and control his sprawling super-human abilities, a troubling contrast to his otherwise typical high school life.\n18) His life took an unexpected turn when his cosmic pendant, \"The Heart of Zadaar,\" began acting wildly unpredictable, causing erratic energy spurts and disturbing his attempts at human-like subtlety.\n19) The strange behavior of the pendant provoked alarming surges in Sean’s powers, inadvertently attracting attention and threatening his low profile life.\n20) Unbeknownst to him, the infamous Zurkon Gang, a notorious group of extraterrestrial marauders, stumbled upon the cosmic energy trail and traced it back to Earth, bringing imminent danger to his newfound sanctuary.\n21) Coveting the immense power of the cosmic pendant, this heinous gang of cosmic criminals hatched an insidious plan to capture the pendant and its power, plotting the unsuspecting Earth as their next hunting ground.\n22) Amid the impending crisis, Sean was contacted by Alura – the sentient protector entity living within his cosmic pendant.\n23) Her virtual form and ethereal voice sprung a series of shocking revelations on the baffled teenager.\n24) Alura, in her translucent form, unraveled the secrets of Sean's noble alien origin and his extraordinary superhuman abilities, shaking his perception of his 'ordinary' existence.\n25) Amidst breath-taking revelations, Alura metamorphosed into a trusty guide for Sean, teaching him cleverly engineered steps to control his powers and fully inhabit his true identity, Zephyr.\n26) Fully harnessed and nurtured by Alura’s guidance, Zephyr debuted his powers in his small town in the form of heroic acts.\n27) However, the public display unintentionally opened a glaring beacon for the menacing Zurkon Gang to Earth's existence.\n28) The ruthless Zurkon Gang, clawing their path through the galaxies, spotted the opening.\n29) In response, they launched a series of terrifying attacks, spreading widespread devastation across Earth, inciting panic and fear in hearts everywhere.\n30) To Zephyr's dismay, humans mistakenly assigned blame for the alien attacks on him, misguided by their fear of the unknown, making the once-revered protector an unjustly painted villain.\n31) Even burdened by misplaced blame, Zephyr remained determinated to shield his Earth home from interstellar threats.\n32) His resolve undeterred and his heart brimming with a sense of duty, he faced the challenge head-on with a promise to win back humans' trust.\n33) The stage was set for an epic showdown with the Zurkon Gang.\n34) This pivotal conflict was an opportunity for Zephyr's resilience and resolution to be put to the ultimate test against these powerful extraterrestrial foes.\n35) The face-off was battle-ridden and cosmic.\n36) Zephyr, now fully equipped with skills he'd learned from Alura, engaged in a ruthless struggle, sparing no effort in his determination to safeguard his adopted home.\n37) As the interstellar battle surged in intensity, exertion, strategy, and endurance, a victorious glimmer finally dawned, with Zephyr overpowering the ruinous Zurkon Gang and dismantling their wicked plan.\n38) The victory, however, came at a severe cost.\n39) Alura's life force was entirely depleted in the process, emptying the pendant of its energy and shrouding Zephyr's fate in uncertainty.\n40) The sudden loss resulted in an immediate cessation of Zephyr’s superhuman faculties, rendering him momentarily powerless, clashing his world between celestial powers and human limitations.\n41) Briefly deprived of his cosmic abilities, Sean, in his wholly human form, was acknowledged by the erstwhile skeptical Earth citizens.\n42) His triumph brought a wave of acceptance, mirroring the collective relief felt by the world.\n43) Now revered as a true protector and ally, Sean not only regained human trust but also etched his heroism in their memories.\n44) Returning to his 'normal' life with Martha and Jonathan, Sean carried with him the silent weight of his celestial legacy and the memory of his heroic acts, filling their simple Kansas abode with a sense of extraordinary accomplishment.\n45) He safeguarded the dormant \"Heart of Zadaar,\" the physical link to his alien lineage and biological parents' sacrifices, enriching his earthly existence with a celestial connection.\n46) The pendant, although dormant, remained a constant reminder of his extraordinary heritage while simultaneously whispering about the incredible potential of what lay ahead for him.\n47) The conclusion hinted at an unexpected twist in Sean's otherwise simple storyline; The cosmic powers ingrained within him started showing signs of reactivation, indicating the possibility of a more impressive future.\n48) Alongside the subtle return of his cosmic abilities, traces of other cosmic pendants surfaced.\n49) This groundbreaking revelation suggested the existence of other interstellar heirs like Sean across the universe, expanding the realms of possibilities and encounters.\n50) The emergence of these revelations set an exciting premise for a sequel, promising audiences more interstellar adventures and cryptic space mysteries.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Zephyr, also known as Sean, the infant son of King Argo and Queen Ellara who is sent to Earth to preserve the royal bloodline of Zadaar.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. **Zephyr's Departure from Zadaar (Sentence 8):** Zephyr, infused with the energy from the cosmic pendant, embarks on a perilous journey to Earth.\n2. **Zephyr's Adoption on Earth (Sentence 14):** Zephyr is discovered by a childless couple, Martha and Jonathan Que, who decide to adopt him, renaming him Sean.\n3. **Discovery of His True Identity and Powers (Sentence 24):** Sean learns about his noble alien origin and his extraordinary superhuman abilities from Alura, the sentient protector entity within his cosmic pendant.\n4. **The Battle Against the Zurkon Gang (Sentence 36):** Zephyr, now fully equipped with skills learned from Alura, engages in a ruthless struggle to safeguard his adopted home against the extraterrestrial foes.\n5. **The Aftermath of the Battle and Newfound Acceptance (Sentence 43):** After defeating the Zurkon Gang, Zephyr, though momentarily powerless, is acknowledged and revered by the Earth citizens, regaining their trust and etching his heroism in their memories.\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **Zephyr's Departure from Zadaar:** Zephyr is in a vulnerable state, dependent on the technology and planning of his parents for survival. His condition is precarious due to the dangers of interstellar travel and the uncertainty of his future on Earth.\n2. **Zephyr's Adoption on Earth:** Zephyr (now Sean) is in a state of safety and comfort, having found a loving family on Earth. However, he is unaware of his true identity and powers, living a seemingly ordinary life.\n3. **Discovery of His True Identity and Powers:** Sean's state changes dramatically as he learns about his alien heritage and superhuman abilities. This revelation brings both excitement and turmoil, as he struggles to comprehend and control his powers.\n4. **The Battle Against the Zurkon Gang:** Zephyr is in a state of determination and readiness, having learned to harness his powers with Alura's guidance. He faces a significant challenge, putting his abilities and resolve to the test against formidable foes.\n5. **The Aftermath of the Battle and Newfound Acceptance:** After the battle, Zephyr experiences a mix of loss (due to Alura's sacrifice) and triumph (from defeating the Zurkon Gang). He is momentarily without his powers but gains something more valuable: the acceptance and reverence of the people on Earth.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nAnalyzing the protagonist's condition throughout the story:\n- Zephyr starts in a vulnerable state (departure from Zadaar).\n- He then finds safety and comfort on Earth but is unaware of his true potential (adoption).\n- The discovery of his identity and powers introduces turmoil and challenge.\n- He rises to the challenge, harnessing his powers and facing his enemies (the battle against the Zurkon Gang).\n- Finally, he achieves a higher state of acceptance and reverence after the battle, despite momentarily losing his powers.\n\nThis pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist faces challenges, falls into dilemmas, but ultimately finds a way out and ends in a better state than at the beginning. The story has elements of a hero's journey, with the protagonist facing significant setbacks but ultimately achieving a triumphant conclusion.\n\nGiven the options provided and the analysis above, the story fits best with the **Double Man in a Hole** arc, as Zephyr faces two significant cycles of challenge and recovery: the first from being a vulnerable infant sent to Earth to finding a new family and learning about his powers, and the second from facing the Zurkon Gang to ultimately achieving victory and acceptance on Earth.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To classify the story arc type, let's follow the instructions step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the protagonist in the story, and identify 5 major events in the story.**\n\nThe protagonist of the story can be considered as Jon, the son of Superman, as the story revolves around his development and the challenges he faces. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n- Event 1: Jon develops heat vision on his birthday (sentence 11).\n- Event 2: Jon and Damian discover that Starro has infected the Justice League and the Teen Titans and intends to infect Jon next (sentence 17).\n- Event 3: Jon and Damian travel to the Fortress of Solitude to analyze a fragment of the Starro spore (sentences 20-22).\n- Event 4: Jon and Damian learn that Starro is on the Watchtower and decide to take him out to free everyone under his control (sentence 23).\n- Event 5: Jon, along with Damian, Batman, and Superman, defeats Starro after he survives the fall to Earth (sentence 35).\n\n2. **At each event, describe the protagonist's state and how it changed relative to the previous events.**\n\n- At Event 1, Jon's state changes significantly as he develops heat vision, marking the beginning of his superhero journey. This is an improvement in his condition as he discovers a new aspect of himself.\n- At Event 2, Jon's state becomes more precarious as he learns about the threat of Starro. This introduces a dilemma, making his condition worse than at Event 1 because he now faces danger.\n- At Event 3, Jon's state improves slightly as he gains more knowledge about the enemy (Starro) and meets a potential ally in Damian. This is a step towards recovery from the dilemma introduced in Event 2.\n- At Event 4, Jon's state improves further as he decides to take action against Starro, showing determination and courage. This marks a significant step towards resolving the dilemma.\n- At Event 5, Jon's state improves dramatically as he, along with others, successfully defeats Starro, resolving the main conflict of the story. This is the highest point in his condition throughout the story.\n\n3. **Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain your reasoning.**\n\nBased on the analysis, the story follows a pattern where the protagonist (Jon) falls into a dilemma (learning about Starro's threat) and then finds a way out (defeating Starro). Initially, Jon is in a relatively safe and unaware state, then he faces a significant challenge (the threat of Starro), and finally, he overcomes this challenge, ending in a better state than where he began (as a confident hero who has saved the day).\n\nThis pattern matches the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc type, where the protagonist's condition improves from the first turning point (developing heat vision and learning about the threat) to the last turning point (defeating Starro and securing a victory). The protagonist starts in a relatively neutral or low state, faces a significant downfall or challenge, and then recovers and ends in a higher state.\n\n4. **Determined story arc type:**\n\nMan in a Hole"

The discovery of the mutilated body in the linen department (sentence 8)\n2. Jake's decision to provide his layman investigative skills to the incident (sentence 10)\n3. The team's suspicion of the mall's Santa Claus and their decision to question him (sentence 14)\n4. The chase through the mall, which leads them to the underground service tunnels (sentences 16-19)\n5.

At the discovery of the mutilated body, Jake is likely in a state of shock and curiosity. He is a bystander who has stumbled upon a horrific crime scene.\n2. When Jake decides to provide his investigative skills, his state changes to one of determination and engagement. He is taking action and trying to make sense of the situation.\n3. As the team suspects the mall's Santa Claus, Jake's state becomes more anxious and focused. He is working with a team to uncover the truth and is getting closer to the culprit.\n4. During the chase through the mall, Jake's state is one of fear and adrenaline. He is in a dangerous situation and is fighting for his life.\n5. At the final confrontation, Jake's state is one of relief and resolution. He has helped to solve the mystery and bring the perpetrator to justice.\n\nBased on these events, we can see that Jake's condition starts in a neutral state (as a bystander), falls into a state of fear and danger (as he becomes more involved in the mystery), and then improves as he works with the team to solve the crime. Ultimately, Jake's condition ends in a better state than where it started, as he has helped to resolve the mystery and has formed bonds with the other characters.\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the story. The \"Man in a Hole\" story arc type is characterized by a protagonist who falls into a dilemma and then finds a way out, ending in a better state than where they started.

The final confrontation where Jessica defeats Newlon, saving herself and others (sentence 30).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **Event 1 (Black Friday Stampede):** Jessica's state is one of shock and possibly guilt, as her actions inadvertently led to the tragic event. She is in a relatively safe position but is surrounded by chaos and death.\n2. **Event 2 (Return of Bobby and Start of Murders):** Jessica's state becomes more complicated with the return of her ex-boyfriend and the start of the murders. She is now in a state of fear and uncertainty, not knowing who is behind the killings or why they are happening.\n3. **Event 3 (Abduction of Friends):** Jessica's state worsens as she experiences loss and fear for her friends' lives. She narrowly escapes death, which puts her in a state of heightened alertness and desperation to uncover the truth behind the murders.\n4. **Event 4 (Discovery of Carver's Identity):** Jessica's state shifts from fear and desperation to shock and determination upon learning that the sheriff, someone she trusted, is the killer. This revelation also puts her in greater danger.\n5. **Event 5 (Final Confrontation):** Jessica's state improves as she takes action to defend herself and others, leading to the defeat of Newlon. Despite the trauma she has experienced, she emerges victorious and somewhat empowered by her ability to save herself and others.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the description of Jessica's state throughout the major events, the story arc can be classified as a \"Man in a Hole\" type. This classification is appropriate because Jessica starts in a relatively safe position but falls into a deep dilemma (the \"hole\") as the story progresses, facing fear, loss, and danger. However, she eventually finds a way out of this hole by taking action, uncovering the truth, and defeating the antagonist, which improves her condition from where it was at the lowest point. Her final state, although likely traumatized, is one of survival and empowerment, which is an improvement over her desperate and fearful state during the climax of the story.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Matilda, an unworldly woman from the quaint provincial town of Green Creek. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. Matilda lands an opportunity to work as a personal assistant for Mrs. Cardwell in Las Vegas (sentence 1).\n2. Matilda and Jonathan discover that his wife's death was the outcome of industrial sabotage planned and executed by a crime syndicate (sentence 7).\n3. They find out that their employer, Mrs. Cardwell, is tangled in the deceit, using her charitable foundations to camouflage money laundering for The Velvet Hammer (sentence 11).\n4. Matilda and Jonathan are ambushed by mercenaries of The Velvet Hammer, but Matilda manages to escape with damning evidence (sentence 14).\n5. Matilda decides to hand over the incriminating evidence to Officer Murphy, leading to a city-wide manhunt and the eventual arrest of the mob members (sentence 17).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: Matilda's state is one of transition and uncertainty as she leaves her calm life in Green Creek for a new, fast-paced life in Las Vegas. Her condition is somewhat vulnerable but hopeful for a better life.\n- **Event 2**: Upon discovering the truth about Jonathan's wife's death, Matilda's state becomes more determined and involved. She moves from being a passive observer in her new life to an active participant in seeking justice. Her condition worsens in terms of the danger and complexity she faces but improves in terms of her resolve and purpose.\n- **Event 3**: Learning about Mrs. Cardwell's involvement in the crime syndicate adds to Matilda's distress and sense of betrayal. Her state becomes more precarious as she navigates a web of deceit that includes her employer. However, this also strengthens her resolve to fight against the corruption. Her condition, in terms of external safety, worsens, but internally, she becomes more resilient.\n- **Event 4**: Being ambushed by mercenaries puts Matilda in a state of immediate danger, which is a significant low point. However, her ability to outmaneuver them and escape with evidence shows her growth into a more capable and courageous individual. Her condition, in terms of personal strength and determination, improves significantly.\n- **Event 5**: By deciding to hand over the evidence, Matilda takes a decisive step towards bringing about justice and change. Her state is one of courage and determination. This action leads to a significant improvement in her condition, as it sets in motion the downfall of the crime syndicate and the transformation of Las Vegas.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, Matilda starts in a somewhat disadvantaged or uncertain situation (leaving her home for an unknown life in Las Vegas), faces significant challenges and dangers (discovery of the crime syndicate, ambush, etc.), but ultimately ends in a much better situation (bringing about justice, finding love, and contributing to the transformation of Las Vegas). This pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (the challenges and dangers in Las Vegas) but finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning.\n\nThe story arc that best fits this description is the \"Man in a Hole\" arc, where the protagonist's condition improves from the first turning point to the last turning point, despite facing significant challenges and setbacks along the way.\n\n### 4.

Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, the arc can be classified by observing the pattern of Timmy's state:\n- Starts in a relatively neutral or positive state (running his detective agency).\n- Faces a challenge (stolen Segway) and actively tries to solve it, showing determination.\n- Experiences a significant downfall (suspension, shutdown of his agency, letting Total go), which represents a low point.\n- Then, recovers and ends in a better state than the lowest point (re-opening his agency), but the story also hints at further adventures and potential downsides (believing Corrina Corrina kidnapped his teacher), suggesting a cycle of fall and recovery.\n\nGiven these observations, the story resembles the **Oedipus** arc, where the protagonist starts high, falls, recovers, and then may face another significant challenge or downfall. However, the precise fit into the Oedipus pattern is nuanced because the story concludes on a note of recovery and potential for further adventure rather than an outright downfall. Yet, considering the overall pattern of fall and recovery, and the potential for future challenges, it aligns closest with the **Oedipus** story arc type among the provided options.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identification of Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist in the story is Victoria Johnson, an accomplished financial analyst. Five major events in the story can be identified as follows:\n\n1. **Introduction to Victoria's Professional Life**: Victoria is introduced as a skilled financial analyst who is persistently sidelined despite her abilities (sentences 3-4).\n2. **The Arrival of Rebecca Mitchell and Subsequent Disappointment**: Rebecca arrives, and despite her lack of skills, she is chosen over Victoria for a promotion, further sidelining Victoria (sentences 5-8).\n3. **Victoria's Decision to Leave and Start Her Own Firm**: Faced with constant underestimation and bias towards physical appearance over competence, Victoria decides to quit her job and start her own financial consultancy firm (sentence 13).\n4. **Victoria's Success and Rebecca's Downfall**: Victoria's startup gains traction and succeeds, while Rebecca's ineptitude leads to the decline of \"Gleason & Grae\" (sentences 15-20).\n5. **Victoria's Triumph and Acceptance as CEO**: Victoria is offered the role of CEO at \"Gleason & Grae\" after successfully turning the firm around, marking a significant professional triumph (sentences 22-23).\n\n### 2. Description of Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Victoria is in a state of professional dissatisfaction, feeling underappreciated and overlooked despite her skills.\n- **Event 2**: Victoria's state worsens as she experiences professional disillusionment with the promotion of Rebecca, feeling her skills are not valued.\n- **Event 3**: Victoria's decision to leave marks a turning point where she begins to take control of her career, moving from a state of disappointment to one of determination and risk-taking.\n- **Event 4**: Victoria's state improves significantly as her startup succeeds, and she proves her competence, contrasting with Rebecca's failure.\n- **Event 5**: Victoria reaches a peak state of professional success and recognition, being accepted as the CEO of \"Gleason & Grae\" and becoming a symbol of hope for women in the corporate world.\n\n### 3. Classification of Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. Initially, Victoria is in a disadvantaged position, feeling undervalued and overlooked. She then faces a setback with Rebecca's promotion, which worsens her state. However, she takes a significant risk by quitting her job and starting her own firm, marking the beginning of her ascent. As her startup succeeds and she eventually becomes the CEO of \"Gleason & Grae\", Victoria's condition improves dramatically from her initial state.\n\nThis pattern follows the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (feeling undervalued and then facing professional disillusionment) but finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning (achieving great success and recognition). The key element here is that Victoria's condition improves from the point of her greatest challenge to the end of the story, fitting the \"Man in a Hole\" narrative.\n\n### 4.

Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1:** Philippa is distraught after losing her promotion and feeling undervalued due to her condition (ME). Her state is low due to professional disappointment and personal frustration.\n- **Event 2:** Philippa's state improves slightly as she becomes engaged with the Richard III Society and begins to pursue her interest in Richard III. This newfound passion gives her a sense of purpose beyond her job.\n- **Event 3:** Philippa's state improves further as she successfully convinces Buckley to work with her. This marks a significant turning point where her efforts start to yield tangible results, boosting her confidence and sense of accomplishment.\n- **Event 4:** Philippa's state reaches a high point when the dig confirms her intuition about Richard III's grave. This validation of her work and instincts is a major triumph, both personally and professionally.\n- **Event 5:** Despite being sidelined during the announcement, Philippa's overall state remains high due to the recognition she receives later (MBE award). The fact that her contribution is acknowledged, even if not immediately, suggests that her condition at the end of the story is better than at the beginning.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the analysis, Philippa's condition throughout the story starts from a low point (professional setback and personal struggle), improves as she engages with her passion for Richard III, faces challenges but ultimately achieves a significant success (finding Richard III's grave), and ends on a high note (recognition for her work). This trajectory aligns with a story arc where the protagonist starts in a disadvantaged situation and ends in a much better one, with their condition improving from the first turning point to the last turning point.\n\n### 4.

Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. Palmer is released from prison and moves in with his grandmother Vivian (sentence 1).\n2. Vivian passes away, and Palmer becomes Sam's temporary guardian (sentence 4).\n3. Palmer bonds with Sam and starts a relationship with Maggie, showing signs of personal growth and integration into the community (sentences 5-8).\n4. Palmer intervenes in a situation where Sam is being abused, leading to his arrest for kidnapping (sentences 19-23).\n5. Shelly gives Palmer custody of Sam, allowing him to start a new life with the boy and Maggie (sentences 26-28).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: Palmer is in a disadvantaged situation, having just been released from prison. His condition is low due to his criminal past and the challenges of reintegrating into society.\n- **Event 2**: Palmer's condition becomes more complicated as he takes on the responsibility of caring for Sam. While this adds a layer of complexity to his life, it also presents an opportunity for growth and redemption.\n- **Event 3**: Palmer's condition improves significantly as he forms connections with Sam and Maggie. He begins to rebuild his life, finding purpose in his relationships and his work.\n- **Event 4**: Palmer's condition worsens temporarily as he faces legal consequences for his actions to protect Sam. Despite his good intentions, he finds himself in trouble with the law again, which could potentially undermine his progress.\n- **Event 5**: Palmer's condition improves dramatically as he is given custody of Sam. This outcome not only solidifies his role as a guardian and caregiver but also symbolizes his redemption and acceptance by society.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story follows a pattern where the protagonist starts in a disadvantaged situation, faces challenges and setbacks, but ultimately achieves a higher state of being. This is characterized by Palmer's initial release from prison, his growth through his relationships with Sam and Maggie, a temporary setback due to legal issues, and finally, his attainment of custody and a newfound sense of purpose and belonging.\n\nThe story arc that best fits this pattern is the **Cinderella** arc, where the protagonist rises, faces a setback, and ultimately achieves a higher state. This is evident in Palmer's journey from a life of crime and incarceration to becoming a responsible guardian and member of his community, overcoming significant obstacles along the way.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To analyze the story arc type, let's break down the task into the requested steps.\n\n### 1. Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\n\nThe protagonists in this story are Dylan Hendricks and his partner Naomi O'Sullivan, as the story revolves around their experiences and personal growth. However, for the sake of simplicity and focus, we can consider Dylan as the primary protagonist to analyze the story arc.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n- **Event 1:** Dylan and Naomi purchase a secluded estate in Montana to escape their addiction struggles and city life (Sentence 2).\n- **Event 2:** They discover an undisclosed rustic cabin on their property and learn that Eddie Thornton, a former heroin addict, has been living there (Sentences 4-6).\n- **Event 3:** Despite initial disruptions, Dylan and Naomi find common ground with Eddie and learn about his past and his path towards recovery, forging an unexpected connection (Sentences 15-19).\n- **Event 4:** Eddie is abducted by a local biker gang seeking his hidden collectibles, prompting Dylan and Naomi to embark on a mission to rescue him (Sentence 20).\n- **Event 5:** They successfully rescue Eddie, and this shared adventure strengthens their bond, leading to a newfound sense of family and fulfillment (Sentences 22-24).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **At Event 1:** Dylan is struggling with substance addiction and legal dilemmas, seeking solace and rehabilitation. His state is one of desperation and hope for a better life.\n- **At Event 2:** The discovery of Eddie and his cabin introduces uncertainty and potential conflict into Dylan's life, complicating his pursuit of a serene and rehabilitative environment. His state becomes more complex, with a mix of frustration and curiosity.\n- **At Event 3:** Dylan finds common ground with Eddie, and through shared experiences and stories, he begins to reconcile with his own addiction history. His state improves as he finds support and understanding, facilitating his recovery.\n- **At Event 4:** The abduction of Eddie introduces a crisis, placing Dylan in a state of urgency and concern for someone he has come to care about. This event tests his resolve and prompts action.\n- **At Event 5:** After rescuing Eddie, Dylan experiences a sense of fulfillment and solidarity, having formed a unique family bond with Eddie and Naomi. His state is one of triumph, connection, and a deeper sense of recovery and purpose.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the analysis, Dylan's condition throughout the story starts at a low point (struggling with addiction), faces complications and challenges (discovery of Eddie and his abduction), but ultimately ends on a higher note (finding connection, rescuing Eddie, and achieving a sense of family and fulfillment). This pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (or multiple dilemmas) but finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Blake Renner. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. Blake proposes to Sarah and she accepts, despite her father's disapproval (sentence 7).\n2. Blake is arrested by corrupt cops after being drugged and destroying a gazebo (sentence 10).\n3. Blake hires a crew to bug-bomb the guest house, causing Randy to have to escape for medical reasons (sentence 15).\n4. Blake and Sarah get married in the backyard, but the wedding is disrupted by Randy (sentence 19).\n5. Blake and Randy make peace, and Blake starts a new life with Sarah and their expected child (sentence 25).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **Event 1 (Proposal):** Blake's state is positive; he has overcome his past issues with drug use, and his relationship with Sarah is progressing. This event marks a high point in his relationship and personal life.\n2. **Event 2 (Arrest):** Blake's state worsens significantly; he is arrested, which could impact his future and relationship with Sarah. This event is a low point, marking a downturn in his condition.\n3. **Event 3 (Bug-bombing the Guest House):** Blake's state improves as he takes action against Randy, regaining some control over his life and home. This action is a recovery from the previous low point.\n4. **Event 4 (Marriage):** Despite the chaos caused by Randy, Blake's state is still on an upward trajectory as he achieves a long-term commitment with Sarah. However, the event also introduces new challenges, keeping his state somewhat precarious.\n5. **Event 5 (Making Peace with Randy):** Blake's state improves significantly; he resolves his conflict with Randy, begins a new job, and is expecting a child with Sarah. This marks a high point in his personal and familial life, indicating a recovery from past dilemmas.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story follows Blake as he faces various challenges, particularly his conflict with Randy, and undergoes periods of decline and recovery. Initially, Blake is in a relatively good state, having overcome past drug issues and being in a relationship. However, his condition deteriorates with the introduction of Randy and the subsequent arrests and conflicts. He then recovers by taking action against Randy and eventually making peace, which leads to a stable and improved state with his marriage and upcoming fatherhood.\n\nThis pattern of facing a dilemma (Randy's presence and the conflict it causes), falling into a worse state (arrests and disruptions), and then recovering (making peace and starting a new life) fits the description of a \"Double Man in a Hole\" story arc. The protagonist experiences two significant cycles of decline and recovery, with the final state being an improvement over the initial condition.\n\n### 4.

closed movie theaters, canceled trips, and just the profundity of the blameless world they missed.\n3) Amidst the chatter, an alert pops up on Lauren's screen; the computer science whiz has received an email from an unknown sender.\n4) The email contains a link to an online game named 'Survival Mode'.\n5) Presenting this peculiar finding to the group during the call, Lauren breathes quiet excitement into an otherwise monotonous day – an online multi-user game promising adrenaline-fueled escapism from the tedium of quarantine.\n6) After an extensive discussion, during which the desire for excitement battles the caution of internet safety, the friends decide to dive into the unknown and play the game.\n7) With strange enthusiasm, they begin their journey into 'Survival Mode'.\n8) However, their initial excitement is slightly dulled as their screens begin to flicker with strange pixels and indecipherable glitches.\n9) Static distorts Lauren’s webcam and among the chaos, horrifying glimpses of faceless entities briefly appear on her Macbook before disappearing, Ava and Max, hear eerie, unexplainable sounds of whispers and far-off thunderstorms.\n10) Despite these unsettling occurrences, they attribute it to game ambiance and decide to play on.\n11) The game, now truly underway, directs them to perform tasks that need to be accomplished within their respective homes.\n12) The tasks start innocuously, merely causing minor disruptions to their households like turning off lights or rifling through papers to locate an old yearbook.\n13) Yet as time ticks on, each task intensifies in danger, creating an environment of pervasive tension, a stark contrast to the safety they previously found in their homes.\n14) Emily, the daring athlete amongst them, stumbles during a task involving retrieving a necklace from her dark, unsettling basement.\n15) The failure takes an immediate toll on Emily, as her lively personality begins to fade toward a terrifying unpredictability, and her usual flush of health drains from her face.\n16) Alarmed by Emily's transformation, the friends start to question the invasive effects of this supposed game.\n17) Their doubts only grow as the game continues to unfold, dishing out darker and more personal tasks;

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe story features a group of friends as protagonists, but for the purpose of analyzing the story arc, we can consider the collective group or focus on key individuals like Sarah and Max, who play significant roles throughout the narrative. Major events in the story include:\n\n1. **Introduction to the Game**: The friends discover and decide to play \"Survival Mode\" (sentences 3-6).\n2. **Initial Gameplay and Strange Occurrences**: They start playing the game, experiencing strange glitches and horrors (sentences 7-10).\n3. **Escalation of Tasks and Horror**: The game's tasks become more dangerous and personal, affecting the friends' mental and physical states (sentences 11-18).\n4. **Desperation and Attempt to Quit**: The friends try to quit the game but find it impossible to escape, leading to a decision to beat the game to survive (sentences 19-23).\n5. **Confronting Fears and the Final Confrontation**: They strategize to beat the game, facing their deepest fears in a psychological battleground (sentences 24-30).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Introduction to the Game)**: The protagonist (collective group) is in a state of boredom and monotony due to quarantine life. The discovery of the game introduces excitement and a desire for escapism.\n- **Event 2 (Initial Gameplay and Strange Occurrences)**: The protagonist's state shifts to one of cautious excitement, with a growing sense of unease due to the strange occurrences in the game.\n- **Event 3 (Escalation of Tasks and Horror)**: The protagonist's state deteriorates as they face increasing danger and horror, leading to fear, anxiety, and a decline in their mental and physical well-being.\n- **Event 4 (Desperation and Attempt to Quit)**: The protagonist reaches a state of desperation, realizing the game's harmful effects and trying to escape, only to find it impossible. This leads to a strategic decision to confront the game head-on.\n- **Event 5 (Confronting Fears and the Final Confrontation)**: The protagonist's state is one of resolve and determination, as they strategically face their fears to survive the game. Despite the trauma, they manage to overcome the game, but not without significant psychological scars.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nAnalyzing the protagonist's condition throughout the story, we see an initial rise in excitement and anticipation (Introduction to the Game), followed by a decline into fear and desperation (Escalation of Tasks and Horror), and then a recovery of sorts as they strategize to overcome the game (Desperation and Attempt to Quit, Confronting Fears and the Final Confrontation). However, the story concludes with the protagonists forever changed, bearing deep psychological scars, and with the ominous hint that their nightmare may not be over (the new update of 'Survival Mode'). This pattern does not fit a simple rise or fall but instead suggests a complex arc where the protagonists face significant challenges, recover to some extent, but ultimately end in a state that, while better than the depths of their desperation, is still markedly worse than their initial state due to the trauma endured.\n\nGiven the complexities and the fact that the protagonists start in a relatively low state (boredom and monotony), face a series of challenges that significantly lower their state (fear, horror, desperation), attempt to recover (strategizing to beat the game), and end in a state that is improved from their lowest point but still marked by trauma and the potential for further horror, the story arc can be seen as reflective of the **Oedipus** type. This classification is based on the pattern of starting high (in terms of safety and normalcy), falling (into horror and desperation), recovering partially (by strategizing to overcome the game), and then facing another significant threat (the new update), which suggests a cycle of descent and partial recovery, followed by the looming potential for another descent.\n\n### 4.

using this method, she quickly confirms that the spirit is not a friendly one.\n9) Seylan explains that Jemma's prank, which involved fabricating a deceased person, may have led a tulpa to take on the guise of the deceased person and wear his identity like a mask that allows the demon to pass into the world of the living.\n10) She gives them instructions on how to close the séance, but the demon interrupts her and she is disconnected again before the girls attempt to close the circle using her advice.\n11) Relieved that the ordeal seems to be over, the members of the group begin to leave the call.\n12) Radina leaves the room, unaware of her boyfriend Alan's body hanging behind her.\n13) Caroline's Zoom background, which shows a looping video of her doing chores, continues playing as the real Caroline suddenly has her face smashed into the camera.\n14) Forgetting to switch off a filter that superimposes masks and face paint onto her, Emma turns her camera towards her living room, where the filter places a kabuki mask on an invisible figure which then turns to look at her.\n15) She runs away and scatters flour on the floor, showing the footprints of the demon approaching her.\n16) Her kitchen cupboards burst open before the demon attacks her, but she escapes into her bedroom.\n17) Radina attempts to flee after Alan's body drops down behind her, but the demon kills her by throwing her into the wall.\n18) Noticing that Caroline is typing gibberish in the chat, Haley and Jemma watch as her camera turns back on to show her being killed by the demon repeatedly smashing her head into her keyboard while she pleads for help.\n19) Haley and Jemma argue and blame each other before Haley is pulled out of the room.\n20) Jemma, who lives around the corner from Haley, immediately leaves her home to help.\n21) Teddy returns to the call to see that only Emma remains, and a warning pops up to remind the group that the call will end in 10 minutes unless they upgrade to the premium version of Zoom.\n22) Unaware of everything that has occurred, Teddy believes Emma is pranking him, but he is attacked by the demon after it takes the form of a horrifying humanoid figure.\n23) He is chased into his garden, where he sees Jinny being lifted into the air before her neck is snapped and her body falls into the swimming pool.\n24) He runs away and hides, using a lighter to see where he is going, but the demon distracts him with an eerie music box his brother used to prank him with as a child.\n25) The demon then knocks him down and he drops the lighter, causing a fire that burns him to death.\n26) Emma, now the only person still active in the call, fearfully turns her camera towards the door of her room after it opens.\n27) She throws a blanket, which drapes itself over an invisible human shape.\n28) She opens her window to escape, but trips and falls to her death.\n29) Jemma breaks into Haley's home and checks the Zoom call on Haley's laptop to see that Emma and Teddy are dead.\n30) The demon smashes a wine bottle over her head and starts to destroy the kitchen, but she recovers and finds Haley hiding under her desk, with the pair attempting to escape the house using the flash of Haley's instant camera to light the way.\n31) The demon appears in the final flash of light, taking the form of a mutilated human, and rushes at them as the Zoom call timer expires.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better (e.g., 0→1→2→4→10)\n- Riches to Rags: Protagonist starts high and ends lower (e.g., 10→9→8→6→0)\n- Man in a Hole: Protagonist falls into trouble but recovers (e.g., 6→2→1→4→10)\n- Icarus: Protagonist rises then falls dramatically (e.g., 2→4→9→5→1)\n- Double Man in a Hole: Two cycles of fall and recovery (e.g., 6→2→7→4→10)\n- Cinderella: Rise, setback, ultimate triumph (e.g., 1→7→4→1→10)\n- Oedipus: Start high, fall, recover, final fall (e.g., 10→4→7→9→1)",

As the story progresses, their condition worsens significantly due to the supernatural events triggered by Jemma's prank. From the point of the séance onwards, the group's situation deteriorates rapidly, leading to a series of tragic events and deaths. The protagonist's condition does not improve at any point after the first turning point (the séance and its immediate aftermath); instead, it consistently worsens, leading to a horrific conclusion.

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\nThe protagonist of the story is Emma, a shy young girl with a traumatic past. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Emma witnesses a traumatic accident at the pond** ( Sentence 4): This event is crucial as it sets the stage for Emma's initial state and her connection to the pond and Emerald.\n2. **Emma witnesses something unspeakable by the pond** (Sentence 9): This event marks a significant turning point where Emma's comfort and solace are disrupted, plunging her into fear and uncertainty.\n3. **Christopher reveals the connection between the victims and the 'Emerald Swan' necklace** (Sentence 13): This event changes Emma's perspective and understanding of the situation, involving her more directly in the mystery.\n4. **Emma and Christopher uncover the cult and its beliefs** (Sentences 15-16): This event escalates the danger and Emma's involvement, requiring her to confront the evil forces head-on.\n5. **The cult is captured, and peace returns to Willow Peaks** (Sentence 21): This final event marks the resolution of the conflict and the beginning of Emma's healing process.\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes\n- **Event 1 (Witnessing the accident)**: Emma is in a vulnerable state, haunted by her past. The accident leaves her with traumatic memories that only Emerald's presence can soothe.\n- **Event 2 (Witnessing something unspeakable)**: Emma's state worsens as she becomes fearful and directly involved in the mystery of the disappearances. Her comfort zone is violated, making her more anxious.\n- **Event 3 (Revelation about the 'Emerald Swan' necklace)**: Emma's state becomes more determined and involved. She decides to join forces with Christopher, indicating a shift from being a passive victim to an active participant in solving the mystery.\n- **Event 4 (Uncovering the cult)**: Emma faces increased danger and is forced to confront the darkness directly. This event tests her courage and resolve, pushing her into a more precarious state.\n- **Event 5 (Cult's capture and return of peace)**: Emma's state improves significantly as she finds healing and respite from her painful memories. She realizes her growth and the significance of her journey with Christopher, symbolizing a move towards a better life.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\nGiven the progression of Emma's state throughout the story, it starts with her in a vulnerable position due to her past trauma. As the story unfolds, she faces additional challenges and dangers (witnessing something unspeakable, getting involved in the mystery, confronting the cult), which worsen her state before she begins to recover and grow (deciding to act, uncovering the truth, and finally finding peace and healing). This pattern, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (the unspeakable event, involvement in the mystery, facing the cult) and then finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning (finding healing, moving towards a future with bravery and strength), aligns with the **Man in a Hole** story arc. The protagonist's condition improves from the lowest point (facing the cult, realizing the danger) to the end, where she emerges stronger and more at peace.\n\n### 4.

His state has changed from being detached to being impacted by the tragedy, showing a more human side.\n\n3. **Story Arc Classification:**\n   - The story starts with Williams in a professional, high-functioning state (as a capable detective).\n   - As the story progresses, he rises to a peak where he is close to solving the mystery (with the diary discovery and understanding the truth about Emily's disappearance).\n   - However, the truth about Emily's death and the impact it has on him and the community lead to a downfall in his emotional state. He becomes emotionally affected and has to struggle with the aftermath, showing a significant change from his initial detached state.\n   - This pattern of rising to a peak (solving the mystery) and then facing a drastic downfall (emotional impact of the tragedy) aligns with the **Icarus** story arc type, where the protagonist starts low, rises to success, and then falls to a low point.\n\n4. **Determined Story Arc Type:**\nIcarus"

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Will Spann, the wealthy real-estate agent whose wife, Lisa, goes missing. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Lisa's Disappearance**: The event where Lisa goes missing at the gas station, marking the beginning of Will's desperate search.\n2. **Discovery of the Security Footage**: Will retrieves the CCTV recorder from the gas station and views the footage with Detective Paterson, learning more about Lisa's disappearance.\n3. **Confrontation with Knuckles**: Will breaks into Knuckles' trailer, fights him, and learns that Knuckles was forced to leave Lisa with someone named Frank.\n4. **Infiltration of Frank's Camp**: Will finds and infiltrates Frank's drug lab camp in the woods, leading to a firefight and the death of Frank and one of his men.\n5. **Reunion with Lisa**: Will finds Lisa alive in a shed near the camp after the building explodes, and they are reunited.\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **At Event 1 (Lisa's Disappearance)**: Will's state changes from normalcy to panic and desperation as he realizes his wife is missing. This marks a significant downturn in his condition.\n- **At Event 2 (Discovery of the Security Footage)**: Will's state becomes more determined and hopeful as he gains his first real lead in finding Lisa. His condition slightly improves as he feels he is making progress.\n- **At Event 3 (Confrontation with Knuckles)**: Will's state is one of aggression and urgency, driven by his desire to find Lisa. This event keeps him in a state of distress but with a newfound determination to rescue his wife.\n- **At Event 4 (Infiltration of Frank's Camp)**: Will's state is dangerous and risky, as he faces significant threats to his life. However, he is driven by the hope of finding Lisa, which motivates him to take these risks. His condition is precarious but with a glimmer of hope.\n- **At Event 5 (Reunion with Lisa)**: Will's state improves dramatically as he finds Lisa alive. This marks a significant upturn in his condition, returning him to a state of happiness and relief after a series of distressing events.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the story. Initially, Will is in a good state, but his condition worsens significantly with Lisa's disappearance. He then embarks on a journey to find her, facing numerous challenges and dangers, which represents a \"hole\" or a low point. Eventually, he finds Lisa alive, which marks a significant improvement in his condition, returning him to a better state than where he started.\n\nThis pattern fits the **Man in a Hole** story arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (Lisa's disappearance and the challenges of finding her) and then finds a way out, ending in a better condition than at the beginning (being reunited with Lisa).\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To classify the story arc of the given narrative, let's break down the task into the required steps:\n\n1. **Identify the protagonist and 5 major events in the story:**\n   - The protagonist is Jane Doe.\n   - Five major events are:\n     1. An unexpected phone call reveals an embarrassing college video of Jane has gone viral (sentence 3).\n     2. Jane retreats from her social life and breaks her promise to Lisa (sentence 4).\n     3. Jane opens up about her ordeal and finds therapeutic comfort in painting with the help of Dr. Sinclair (sentence 6).\n     4. Jane suffers a panic attack at a local café, indicating her ongoing struggle (sentence 8).\n     5. Jane decides to face her fear and share her story via her art at a public gallery, leading to immense appreciation and her redemption (sentences 12 and 13).\n\n2. **Describe the protagonist's state and how it changed relative to the previous events:**\n   - **Event 1 (Viral Video):** Jane's state changes from being a confident social butterfly to experiencing public humiliation. This event marks a significant downturn in her condition.\n   - **Event 2 (Retreat from Social Life):** Jane's state worsens as she isolates herself, breaking her promise to Lisa and abandoning her social life. This indicates a further decline in her condition.\n   - **Event 3 (Finding Comfort in Painting):** Jane's state begins to improve as she finds solace in painting and opens up to Dr. Sinclair. This marks the beginning of her recovery and an upward trend in her condition.\n   - **Event 4 (Panic Attack):** Despite her progress, Jane's state takes a temporary downturn as she faces a reminder of her ongoing struggle with a panic attack. However, this setback does not fully reverse her previous gains, indicating a complex but still generally improving condition.\n   - **Event 5 (Public Gallery and Redemption):** Jane's state significantly improves as she faces her fears, shares her story through art, and receives appreciation. This event marks a peak in her recovery, showing a substantial improvement in her condition from where she started.\n\n3. **Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain the reasoning:**\n   - The story starts with Jane in a high state (as a social butterfly) and then faces a significant downfall (public humiliation and social retreat). However, she then embarks on a journey of recovery and improvement (finding comfort in painting and eventually facing her fears to share her story publicly). This pattern does not fit the \"Rags to Riches\" arc perfectly because Jane starts in a relatively good position, not a disadvantaged one. It also doesn't fit \"Riches to Rags\" because she ends in a better state than she began. The \"Man in a Hole\" arc is closer because Jane falls into a dilemma (public humiliation and isolation) and then finds a way out, ending better than she started. The \"Cinderella\" arc also seems applicable because Jane rises (initial social success), faces a setback (public humiliation), and ultimately achieves a higher state (redemption through art). However, the most fitting seems to be the \"Man in a Hole\" because it accurately describes Jane's fall into a problem and her eventual rise out of it to a better condition, without the specific fairytale-like elements implied by \"Cinderella.\"\n\n4. **Determined story arc type:**\nMan in a Hole"

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Edee Holzer. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. Edee leaves the city and moves to a remote cabin in Wyoming to live in solitude (sentence 2).\n2. She reaches her breaking point after a black bear destroys her supplies, and she attempts to take her life (sentence 6).\n3. She is rescued by Miguel and his nurse friend Alawa after being injured during a snowstorm (sentence 9).\n4. Miguel teaches her survival skills, and they develop a friendship over time (sentences 12-14).\n5. Edee finds Miguel bedridden and dying, and she finally opens up about her past, thanks him for helping her heal, and begins to reconnect with her sister (sentences 22-26).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **Initial Isolation (sentence 2):** Edee's state is one of intentional isolation and attempted self-sufficiency, driven by her desire to escape the trauma of her past. Her condition is low due to her recent traumatic experience and her struggles with basic provisions.\n\n2. **Breaking Point (sentence 6):** Edee's state deteriorates to its lowest point as she attempts to take her life, indicating a complete overwhelm by her circumstances and emotional pain. This is the darkest moment in her journey.\n\n3. **Rescue and Aid (sentence 9):** After being rescued and aided by Miguel and Alawa, Edee's state begins to improve slightly as she receives the help she desperately needs. However, she is still in a vulnerable state, both physically and emotionally.\n\n4. **Friendship and Growth (sentences 12-14):** As Edee learns survival skills from Miguel and they develop a friendship, her state improves significantly. She begins to find a sense of purpose and connection, which helps in her healing process. This marks a turning point where her condition starts to ascend towards a better state.\n\n5. **Confronting the Past and Healing (sentences 22-26):** In the final major event, Edee confronts her past and the reasons for her isolation. She thanks Miguel for his role in her healing and begins to reconnect with her sister, symbolizing a significant step towards recovery and reintegration into life. Her state is now better than at the beginning of the story, as she has found a way to start healing and moving forward.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, it starts at a low point due to Edee's trauma and her struggles in solitude. It then hits a rock bottom when she attempts to take her life, indicating the lowest point in her journey. From there, with the help of Miguel and their developing friendship, her condition improves as she learns to survive and eventually confronts her past. This trajectory shows a character who falls into a dilemma (her isolation and struggle to survive, culminating in a suicide attempt), finds a way out with the help of others, and ends in a better state than where she started, having begun to heal and reconnect with the world.\n\n### 4.

Five major events in the story are:\n   - Event 1: Emily astounds her cybersecurity class by deciphering an RSA encryption algorithm (Sentence 1).\n   - Event 2: Emily meets Jon, a charismatic literature major, during an exploration of D.H. Lawrence's novels (Sentence 4).\n   - Event 3: Emily and Jon are paired together for an interdisciplinary project competition (Sentence 5).\n   - Event 4: Emily and Jon clinch first place in the academic project contest (Sentence 9).\n   - Event 5: Emily and Jon realize their feelings for each other and interpret their shared triumph as a sign of attraction (Sentence 10).\n\n### Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- At Event 1, Emily's state is one of intellectual triumph and recognition. She is admired for her talent, indicating a high point in her academic life.\n- Moving to Event 2, Emily's state evolves as she meets Jon. This introduces a new dimension to her life—personal connection and potential romance—though her intellectual prowess remains a core aspect of her identity. Her state is still positive, with an added layer of personal growth.\n- By Event 3, Emily is faced with the challenge of working with someone from a different academic background. Initially, this might be seen as a potential dilemma or a test of her adaptability. Her state could be considered as entering a period of uncertainty or slight discomfort due to the unknown outcomes of the project.\n- At Event 4, Emily's state improves significantly as she and Jon succeed in the project competition. This success not only boosts her academic standing but also fosters a deeper connection with Jon, enhancing her personal life. This event marks a clear upward trend in her overall state.\n- By Event 5, Emily's state has transformed further. She has not only achieved academic success but has also found a romantic connection with Jon. Her initial melancholy (mentioned in Sentence 3) seems to have been alleviated by her experiences and the positive outcomes of her interactions with Jon. This indicates a substantial improvement in her emotional and personal life.\n\n### Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the progression of Emily's state throughout the story, it's evident that she starts from a position of intellectual strength but personal melancholy, faces challenges and uncertainties, and then rises to achieve both academic success and personal fulfillment. This trajectory aligns with a story arc where the protagonist's condition improves from the initial point to the final point, despite facing challenges and uncertainties along the way.\n\nThe determined story arc type is Rags to Riches."

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\nThe protagonist of the story is Zoey Miller, a junior at Queens University of Charlotte. Five major events in the story are:\n- Event 1: Zoey meets Zach MacLaren after he accidentally hits her with a soccer ball (sentence 4).\n- Event 2: Zoey spends time with Zach's family, including his cousin Miles, after Zach gets amnesia and mistakes her for his girlfriend (sentences 13-18).\n- Event 3: Zoey discovers Miles is in a polyamorous relationship, leading to disappointment, but she then bonds with Zach (sentences 20-25).\n- Event 4: The real Zoey (Zach's girlfriend) appears, accusing Zoey of identity theft, leading to Zoey leaving the MacLarens' and facing rumors and negative attention at school (sentences 26-30).\n- Event 5: Zoey confesses her feelings to Zach after he has broken up with his girlfriend, and they kiss (sentences 39-40).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n- **Event 1:** Initially, Zoey is portrayed as a confident, intelligent individual who does not believe in traditional romantic love. Her state is one of independence and self-assurance. After meeting Zach, her state slightly changes as she begins to interact with him, but she remains skeptical about romance.\n- **Event 2:** Zoey's state improves as she finds common ground with Miles and begins to enjoy her time with Zach's family. She starts to open up and shows a more vulnerable side, indicating a positive change in her emotional state.\n- **Event 3:** Although initially disappointed by Miles' relationship status, Zoey's state takes a turn for the better as she bonds with Zach over shared activities. This marks a significant positive shift in her emotional state, as she starts to form a connection with Zach.\n- **Event 4:** Zoey's state worsens dramatically as she faces accusations, rumors, and negative attention. She feels deceived, embarrassed, and her self-esteem takes a hit. This event marks a low point in her emotional journey.\n- **Event 5:** After reflecting on her feelings and with the encouragement of her mom, Zoey's state improves as she decides to take a chance and express her feelings to Zach. The positive outcome of this event, with Zach reciprocating her feelings, leaves her in a much better state than at the beginning of the story.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\nThe story arc can be classified based on how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the narrative. Initially, Zoey is in a state of independence and skepticism towards love. She then faces a series of events that challenge her beliefs and emotional state, including positive interactions with Zach and his family, followed by a significant setback when her identity is mistaken and she faces social backlash. However, she recovers from this low point by reflecting on her feelings and taking action, leading to a positive outcome where she confesses her feelings to Zach and they kiss.\n\nThis pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist faces challenges, falls into a difficult situation (or \"hole\"), and then finds a way out, ending in a better condition than where she started. Given the cyclical nature of her challenges and recoveries, particularly the significant drop in her state after the identity theft accusation and her subsequent rise after confessing her feelings, the story fits the \"Double Man in a Hole\" arc. This arc type is characterized by the protagonist experiencing two cycles of falling into a dilemma and then recovering, which aligns with Zoey's experiences of facing setbacks and then overcoming them to achieve a positive outcome.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, let's follow the steps outlined.\n\n1. **Identify the protagonist and 5 major events in the story:**\n   - The protagonist is John Hanson Jr.\n   - Five major events in the story are:\n     1. John Jr. begins to explore his father's past by looking at an old photograph and a steel chest containing military relics (sentences 1-4).\n     2. He discovers a mix of military memorabilia and heartwarming family memories, which sparks his curiosity about the dual nature of his father's life (sentences 5-11).\n     3. John Jr. decides to delve deeper into his father's life, starting a thorough investigation by gathering information from various sources (sentences 12-16).\n     4. Through his research, John Jr. uncovers the complexities of his father's military career and personal life, understanding the burdens his father carried (sentences 17-24).\n     5. John Jr. comes to terms with his father's past, praising his heroism and understanding his decision to keep war scars separate from family life, leading to a new appreciation and connection with his father's legacy (sentences 25-31).\n\n2. **Describe the protagonist's state and how it changed at each event:**\n   - **Event 1:** John Jr. is in a state of quiet reflection, seeking to understand his father. His state is one of curiosity and perhaps a sense of disconnection from his father's past.\n   - **Event 2:** As he discovers more about his father, John Jr.'s state shifts to one of intrigue and a deepening curiosity, with a growing desire to understand the contradictions of his father's life.\n   - **Event 3:** John Jr. becomes proactive and determined, taking on the role of an investigator. His state is now one of engagement and pursuit of knowledge.\n   - **Event 4:** Through his research, John Jr. gains a deeper understanding of his father's dual life. His state evolves to one of empathy and comprehension, as he begins to see his father in a new light.\n   - **Event 5:** Finally, John Jr. reaches a state of appreciation, respect, and connection with his father's legacy. He has moved from curiosity to understanding and admiration.\n\n3. **Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain the reasoning:**\n   - The story follows John Jr. as he moves from a state of curiosity and disconnection to one of understanding, empathy, and connection with his father's past. This journey represents an improvement in John Jr.'s condition, as he gains a deeper understanding of his father and appreciates his legacy more fully.\n   - The story does not depict John Jr. falling into a significantly worse state at any point; instead, it shows a gradual progression towards a better understanding and appreciation of his father.\n   - This pattern aligns with the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist faces a dilemma (in this case, a lack of understanding about his father) and finds a way out, ending in a better state than at the beginning. John Jr.'s journey is one of discovery and growth, culminating in a more positive and enlightened state.\n\n4. **Determined story arc type:**\n   Man in a Hole"

Five major events in the story are:\n1. **Event 1**: Brian's deployment in Afghanistan and his family's longing for his return (sentences 1-3).\n2. **Event 2**: Brian gets shot in the leg while attempting to rescue an Afghan National Army comrade (sentence 6).\n3. **Event 3**: Brian has his leg amputated at the VA Center in Syracuse (sentence 10).\n4. **Event 4**: The family is struck by tragedy when Joey, Brian's son, is killed in an accident (sentence 21).\n5. **Event 5**: The family begins to move emotionally forward from Joey's death with new developments such as Isaac's graduation and enlistment, and the birth of Jaxon (sentences 28-30).\n\n### 2. Description of Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **At Event 1**: Brian is away from his family, which indicates a state of separation and potential emotional distress for both him and his family. However, he is still physically intact and serving his country, suggesting a level of fulfillment in his professional life.\n- **At Event 2**: Brian's condition worsens significantly as he is injured, which not only affects his physical state but also introduces the possibility of long-term psychological effects due to his experience.\n- **At Event 3**: The amputation of his leg represents a new low for Brian, both physically and emotionally. He is struggling to come to terms with his new disability and the potential end of his military career, affecting his sense of identity and usefulness.\n- **At Event 4**: The death of his son Joey plunges Brian and his family into a deeper state of grief and tragedy. This event compounds Brian's existing struggles with his physical disability and emotional well-being.\n- **At Event 5**: Despite the previous tragedies, Brian and his family start to show signs of recovery and moving forward. The focus on new life (the birth of Jaxon), Isaac's military service, and the family's effort to heal together indicate a gradual improvement in their emotional state.\n\n### 3. Classification of Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. Initially, Brian faces a dilemma (separation from his family and subsequent injury), falls into a deeper hole (amputation and struggling to adapt), but then begins to recover (finding ways to cope with his disability and supporting his family through their grief). However, the story takes another turn with the tragic loss of his son, which again plunges the family into a state of sorrow. Eventually, the family starts to move forward, indicating a second cycle of recovery.\n\nThis pattern fits the **Double Man in a Hole** story arc, where the protagonist faces two significant cycles of falling into a dilemma and then recovering. The first cycle involves Brian's injury, amputation, and initial struggle to adapt, followed by a recovery phase as he learns to cope with his new condition. The second cycle is triggered by the tragic death of his son, which again sends the family into a state of grief, only to eventually start the process of healing and moving forward.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To classify the story arc type, let's first identify the protagonist and 5 major events in the story.\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Nathan, a grizzled author.\n\nHere are 5 major events in the story:\n\n1. Nathan discovers a worn-out, dust-laden envelope with the news of his estranged father's death (sentence 4).\n2. Nathan and his sister Vanessa reunite at the John F. Kennedy Airport and head to their childhood hometown in Bar Harbor, Maine (sentences 9-10).\n3. Nathan stumbles upon a collection of alchemical manuscripts and dark occult practices in his father's private study (sentence 17).\n4. Nathan and Vanessa discover evidence of horrifying alchemical necromantic experiments and learn the truth about their father's past (sentences 21-23).\n5. Nathan and Vanessa help their mother's spirit find peace, and they decide to forgive their father's sins (sentences 26-29).\n\nNow, let's describe the protagonist's state at each event and how it changed relative to the previous events:\n\nAt event 1, Nathan is in a state of shock and sadness upon learning of his father's death. His state is low due to the unexpected news.\n\nAt event 2, Nathan's state improves slightly as he reunites with his sister and returns to his childhood hometown. However, the reason for their reunion is still a somber one, so his state is still relatively low.\n\nAt event 3, Nathan's state takes a turn for the worse as he discovers the dark secrets of his father's past. He is likely feeling disturbed, confused, and concerned about his family's history.\n\nAt event 4, Nathan's state reaches a low point as he learns the horrifying truth about his father's experiments and the consequences of his actions. He is likely feeling shocked, angry, and saddened by the revelation.\n\nAt event 5, Nathan's state improves significantly as he and his sister help their mother's spirit find peace, and they decide to forgive their father's sins. He is likely feeling a sense of closure, relief, and newfound understanding of his family's past.\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, the story arc type can be classified as \"Man in a Hole\". The reasoning is as follows:\n\n* The protagonist starts in a relatively low state (event 1) and falls into a deeper hole (events 3-4) as he discovers the dark secrets of his father's past.\n* However, he eventually finds a way out of the hole (event 5) and ends in a better state than where he began, having found closure and forgiveness.\n\nThe determined story arc type is: Man in a Hole"

        "output": "To analyze the story arc, we first need to identify the protagonist. In this story, the protagonist can be considered as Ben, as the narrative focuses significantly on his actions and decisions throughout the story.\n\nNext, we'll identify 5 major events in the story and describe the protagonist's state at each event, along with how it changed relative to the previous events.\n\n1. **Event: Ben joins Barbara in the house (sentence 5).**\n   - Protagonist's state: Ben is in a relatively safe position, having found shelter and a companion.\n   - Change: This is an initial point of safety and alliance for Ben.\n\n2. **Event: Ben discovers that zombies are afraid of fire and light, and he begins to fortify the house (sentence 8).**\n   - Protagonist's state: Ben is proactive and has found a way to defend against the zombies, showing a sense of control and hope.\n   - Change: Ben's condition improves as he gains a method of defense and starts to secure their shelter.\n\n3. **Event: The group devises an escape plan to flee to a rescue center (sentence 17).**\n   - Protagonist's state: Ben is part of a group with a plan for escape and potential salvation, indicating a rise in his condition towards a more positive outcome.\n   - Change: This represents a peak where Ben and the group have a clear goal and a sense of unity and purpose.\n\n4. **Event: Ben fights his way back to the house after the truck explodes, and he beats Harry to gain entry (sentences 21-23).**\n   - Protagonist's state: Ben's condition has significantly worsened; he has lost allies, faces opposition from within the group, and is fighting for survival.\n   - Change: This marks a drastic downfall for Ben, as his situation becomes more desperate and violent.\n\n5. **Event: Ben is mistakenly shot by Vince, directed by Sheriff McClelland, and his body is burned with the executed zombies (sentences 35-36).**\n   - Protagonist's state: Ben's condition has hit its lowest point, as he is killed and his body is treated as one of the undead.\n   - Change: This is the final downfall, where Ben's attempts at survival and his rise to a position of relative control and hope end in tragedy.\n\nNow, to classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout the story:\n\n- The story starts with Ben in a relatively neutral or slightly disadvantaged position (joining Barbara).\n- He rises to a point of control and hope (discovering zombies' fear of fire and planning an escape).\n- However, he then faces a significant downfall (loss of allies, fighting for survival, and eventual death).\n- This pattern does not fit the \"Rags to Riches\" or \"Man in a Hole\" arcs, as Ben's condition does not ultimately improve.\n- It doesn't fit \"Riches to Rags\" perfectly either, as Ben does not start in a high-status position.\n- The \"Icarus\" arc is close, but Ben's starting point is not particularly low, and his rise is more about finding ways to survive rather than achieving success.\n- The \"Cinderella\" arc does not apply, as Ben's story does not end on a high note after a setback.\n- The \"Double Man in a Hole\" arc could be considered, but Ben's story does not show two clear cycles of dilemma and recovery.\n- The \"Oedipus\" arc seems the most fitting, as Ben starts in a neutral position, rises to a point of control and hope, recovers from some setbacks, but ultimately faces a drastic and final downfall.\n\nThe determined story arc type is Oedipus."

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Joshua, a tenth grader with a unique habit of writing chilling horror stories. Five major events in the story can be identified as follows:\n\n1. **Introduction to Joshua's Life and Habits**: Joshua is introduced, showing his life and his habit of writing horror stories.\n2. **Sharing His Story at School**: Joshua decides to share his latest horror story at the school's show-and-tell session, which leads to his guardians being called in.\n3. **Real-Life Events Mimicking His Story**: A series of uncanny events unfold in the city, mirroring the terrifying events described in Joshua's story, alarming both Joshua and the community.\n4. **Discovery of the Truth Behind \"The Terminus\"**: An investigation uncovers the alarming truth that \"The Terminus\" isn't a product of Joshua's imagination but an ominous messenger of an old witch's curse on the city.\n5. **Heroic Resolution**: Joshua crafts a narrative where \"The Terminus\" is defeated heroically, and unbelievably, the events of his story happen in the city, leading to the arrest of \"The Terminus\" and Joshua being recognized as a hero.\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: Joshua is in a neutral state, living his life with a unique habit that sets him apart but doesn't necessarily put him in a position of advantage or disadvantage.\n- **Event 2**: Joshua's state becomes somewhat negative as his actions lead to concern from his school and guardians, potentially isolating him or making him feel like an outsider.\n- **Event 3**: Joshua's state worsens as he and the community are alarmed by the real-life events mimicking his story, suggesting a loss of control or understanding of his creations' impact.\n- **Event 4**: Joshua's state begins to improve as he discovers the truth behind \"The Terminus,\" giving him a sense of purpose and direction to address the situation.\n- **Event 5**: Joshua's state significantly improves as he successfully resolves the crisis, turning him into a hero and changing his social standing from an outsider to a celebrated individual.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, it can be observed that Joshua starts in a relatively neutral position, faces challenges and setbacks (being seen as an outsider, losing control over his story's impact), and then rises to a higher state by discovering the truth and heroically resolving the crisis. This pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (the negative repercussions of his story and the mysterious events) and then finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning.\n\nThe story arc types provided include \"Rags to Riches,\" \"Riches to Rags,\" \"Man in a Hole,\" \"Icarus,\" \"Double Man in a Hole,\" \"Cinderella,\" and \"Oedipus.\" The description of Joshua's journey fits best with the \"Man in a Hole\" arc, as he faces a dilemma (the events mirroring his story and the subsequent investigation and truth revelation) and then recovers, ending in a better state than where he started (being celebrated as a hero).\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonists in the story are Amy and John Mackenzie, siblings who are the central characters around whom the story revolves. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. The news of their estranged father's terminal pancreatic cancer diagnosis (sentence 5).\n2. The discovery of weird incidents at the ancestral ranch (sentence 10).\n3. The finding of a century-old diary in a hidden wooden cabin (sentence 13).\n4. The revelation of a terrifying secret about their bloodline curse (sentence 16).\n5. The lifting of the ancestral curse after making amends for their ancestors' misdeeds (sentence 21).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (sentence 5):** The protagonists' peaceful lives are disrupted by the news of their father's illness. Their state changes from being content and successful in their careers to facing a personal crisis that forces them to re-evaluate their priorities.\n  \n- **Event 2 (sentence 10):** Upon arriving at the ranch, they encounter unexplained events, which shifts their state from merely dealing with a family health issue to facing mysterious and unsettling phenomena. This adds a layer of fear and uncertainty to their situation.\n\n- **Event 3 (sentence 13):** The discovery of the diary provides them with clues about their family's past and the possible source of the paranormal activities. At this point, their state transitions from mere victims of circumstances to active investigators seeking answers and solutions.\n\n- **Event 4 (sentence 16):** Learning about the bloodline curse deepens their understanding of the situation but also increases their fear and sense of responsibility. Their state becomes more urgent and desperate as they realize the gravity of their family's situation and the need for a resolution.\n\n- **Event 5 (sentence 21):** After making amends and lifting the curse, the protagonists experience a significant improvement in their situation. The paranormal activities decrease, and their father's health starts to stabilize. This marks a positive change in their state, moving from desperation and fear to relief and hope.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the progression of the protagonists' state throughout the story, it starts with a peaceful and successful life, then descends into crisis and fear with the introduction of the father's illness and the paranormal events, and finally ascends to a state of resolution and improvement after lifting the curse. This pattern indicates that the story follows a specific arc where the protagonists face a dilemma, find a way out, and end up in a better state than when they started.\n\nThe story arc type that best fits this description is the \"Man in a Hole\" because it accurately depicts the protagonists falling into a difficult situation (the hole) and then finding a way out of it, ultimately ending in a better condition than they were at the beginning of the story.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\nThe protagonists in the story are Louise and Michael, but since the story concludes with Louise being the last one affected directly by the events, we can focus on Louise as the primary protagonist for the purpose of analyzing the story arc. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. The siblings' arrival at the farm and their mother's subsequent death (sentences 1-3).\n2. The discovery of their mother's diary and the understanding of the supernatural presence (sentences 5-6).\n3. The encounter with Father Thorne and the beginning of bizarre occurrences (sentences 7-9).\n4. The realization that the entity is possessing and manipulating people around them, including Charlie's death and the nurse's possession (sentences 10-27).\n5. The final confrontation and Louise's demise (sentences 31-32).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes\n- **Event 1:** Louise's state is one of concern and possibly guilt over her father's illness and her mother's reaction. The event of her mother's death changes her state to shock and grief.\n- **Event 2:** Louise's state transitions to fear and confusion as she begins to understand the supernatural forces at play. This discovery deepens her emotional distress.\n- **Event 3:** With the encounter with Father Thorne, Louise's state becomes more ominous and foreboding, increasing her fear and uncertainty about what is happening.\n- **Event 4:** As the entity's influence becomes more apparent and violent, Louise's state deteriorates further into horror and desperation. She loses allies and experiences traumatic events, making her more vulnerable.\n- **Event 5:** In the final confrontation, Louise's state is one of complete despair and hopelessness, culminating in her death at the hands of the entity.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\nBased on Louise's condition throughout the story, it's clear that she starts in a state of concern but relative stability, only to descend into deeper and deeper states of fear, grief, and ultimately, despair and death. This trajectory indicates a story arc where the protagonist's condition worsens significantly from the beginning to the end, with no recovery or improvement.\n\nThe story arc types provided suggest that a \"Riches to Rags\" arc is characterized by a protagonist who starts in a high-status position but ends in a significantly lower state. While Louise doesn't start in a traditionally \"high-status\" position, her condition deteriorates from bad to worse, fitting the essence of a downward spiral.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\n\nThe protagonist in this story is not a single character but rather a collective of the main characters, including John, Violet, and Billy, who are at the forefront of the efforts to reclaim their village's spirit and festival from Herbert Dippleton's control. However, if we are to consider a single character whose transformation is pivotal to the story's resolution, it would be Herbert Dippleton, the eccentric billionaire.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Introduction of Herbert Dippleton and his stifling laws**: Herbert introduces a series of laws that dampen the spirit of the Raspberry Festival and the village.\n2. **The formation of an alliance among John, Violet, and Billy to counter Herbert's influence**: The trio begins devising plans to seize control of their beloved festival back from Herbert.\n3. **The dismantling of Herbert's CCTV network and the ensuing chaos**: The villagers' plans start to unfold, leading to humorous misadventures and a significant challenge to Herbert's control.\n4. **The climax of the festival where Herbert's facade begins to crack**: Herbert is exposed to the villagers' true spirit, and his aloofness begins to break down, revealing a deep-seated loneliness.\n5. **The final acceptance and transformation of Herbert**: Herbert opens up to the villagers, invites them into his castle, and symbolically marks a new chapter of unity and friendship in Berrywood.\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **Introduction of Herbert Dippleton and his stifling laws**: Herbert is in a position of power but emotionally isolated. His condition is one of detachment and control.\n2. **The formation of an alliance among John, Violet, and Billy to counter Herbert's influence**: This event doesn't directly change Herbert's state but sets the stage for challenges to his authority. He remains detached but is about to face opposition.\n3. **The dismantling of Herbert's CCTV network and the ensuing chaos**: Herbert's control is challenged, but his emotional state remains largely unchanged. He's still isolated but perhaps slightly perturbed.\n4. **The climax of the festival where Herbert's facade begins to crack**: Herbert's emotional state begins to shift as he's exposed to the warmth and community of the villagers. His loneliness is highlighted, and his detachment starts to break down.\n5. **The final acceptance and transformation of Herbert**: Herbert undergoes a significant transformation, moving from isolation to connection. He opens up, accepts the villagers, and finds a sense of belonging and unity.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven Herbert's journey, his story arc can be classified based on his transformation from a state of isolation and control to one of connection and unity. Initially, Herbert is in a state of emotional poverty (or \"rags\") due to his loneliness and detachment. As the story progresses, he faces challenges to his authority but doesn't immediately change. However, through his exposure to the villagers' warmth and community, he begins to transform, ultimately ending in a much better state (\"riches\") of emotional connection and acceptance.\n\nThis transformation does not follow a simple \"Rags to Riches\" arc because Herbert's journey involves a significant downfall of his previous persona and a rebuilding into a new, more connected individual. It's more aligned with a transformative journey where the protagonist faces a dilemma (his isolation and the challenge to his control), falls deeper into it (as his loneliness is exposed), and then finds a way out (through his acceptance and transformation).\n\nHowever, considering the provided story arc types and focusing on Herbert's transformation, the closest match seems to be the \"Cinderella\" arc, where the protagonist rises (Herbert's initial power and control), faces a setback (the challenge to his authority and exposure of his loneliness), and ultimately achieves a higher state (his transformation and acceptance by the villagers).\n\n### 4.

His condition ends on a note of loss and melancholy, despite the physical escape.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the fluctuations in Preble's condition throughout the story, we can analyze the story arc types provided:\n\n- **Rags to Riches**: This does not apply because Preble's condition does not consistently improve from the start to the end.\n- **Riches to Rags**: This also does not fit because Preble does not start in a high-status position that consistently worsens.\n- **Man in a Hole**: While Preble faces dilemmas and finds ways out, his overall condition at the end is not significantly better than at the beginning, considering the emotional loss.\n- **Icarus**: Preble's story follows a pattern where he rises (falls in love with Bella, finds solace), reaches a peak (is rescued by Bella, overcomes adversaries), but then faces a drastic downfall (loses Bella, ends in a melancholic state). This pattern aligns with the Icarus story arc.\n- **Double Man in a Hole**: While Preble faces multiple cycles of dilemma and recovery, the overall narrative does not suggest he ends in a significantly better state than when he started.\n- **Cinderella**: Preble's story does not follow the typical Cinderella arc of rising, facing a setback, and then achieving a higher state than before.\n- **Oedipus**: Preble's narrative does not fit the Oedipus pattern of starting high, falling, recovering, and then facing another significant downfall, as his starting point is not one of high status or knowledge.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Pippa, a young woman who moves into her first apartment with her boyfriend Thomas. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Pippa and Thomas move into their new apartment and start watching their neighbors** (sentences 1-4).\n2. **Pippa and Thomas spy on their neighbors and learn about \"Brent's\" infidelity** (sentences 5-12).\n3. **Pippa discovers Julia's situation and tries to warn her, leading to a confrontation with Thomas** (sentences 13-19).\n4. **Julia's apparent death and Thomas's subsequent breakup with Pippa and his own death** (sentences 20-28).\n5. **The revelation that Seb and Julia are alive, and Pippa's revenge against them** (sentences 29-41).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1:** Pippa is in a positive state, having just moved into her first apartment with her boyfriend. She's curious and playful, giving her neighbors pseudo names.\n- **Event 2:** Pippa's state becomes more voyeuristic and slightly guilty as she and Thomas spy on their neighbors. However, she's still in a relatively good place in her relationship and life.\n- **Event 3:** Pippa's condition starts to deteriorate as she becomes more invested in Julia's life and tries to warn her about Seb's infidelity. This leads to tension in her relationship with Thomas, causing her emotional state to worsen.\n- **Event 4:** Pippa's state hits a low point with Julia's apparent death and Thomas's death. She's heartbroken and alone, feeling responsible for the tragic events.\n- **Event 5:** Pippa's condition improves slightly as she seeks revenge against Seb and Julia, but it's a dark and vengeful improvement. She's no longer the carefree or even morally grounded person she was at the beginning.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven Pippa's journey, her condition starts in a relatively high state (happy in her new apartment and relationship), faces significant setbacks and worsens (emotional distress, loss of relationship, and guilt over deaths), and while she does take action and exact revenge, her final state is morally and emotionally darker than her initial state. This pattern doesn't fit the \"Rags to Riches\" or \"Man in a Hole\" arcs because Pippa doesn't end in a better state than she started. It doesn't fit \"Icarus\" perfectly because Pippa's rise and fall aren't as straightforward, and she doesn't exactly \"rise\" in the traditional sense. It also doesn't fit \"Cinderella\" because, after her setback, Pippa doesn't achieve a higher state of being; instead, she becomes consumed by vengeance. The closest match is \"Riches to Rags\" because Pippa starts in a good place (emotionally and relationally) and ends in a significantly lower state (emotionally darker, alone, and morally compromised), even though the story takes a complex path to get there.\n\n### 4.

Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. Philip finds a mysterious package on his gate with a message that reads: \"Relive what you left behind, Philip.\" (Event related to sentence 6)\n2. Philip and his friend Luca start investigating Philip's past NYPD cases to unravel the mystery of the package. (Event related to sentence 12)\n3. Philip discovers that the case is linked to Vicente Russo, a ruthless underworld kingpin from his past. (Event related to sentence 15)\n4. Philip confronts Russo in a battle of wits and courage at 'Casa Bramasole'. (Event related to sentence 19)\n5. Philip apprehends Russo, solving the puzzle that began with the mysterious package, and decides to integrate more into the Cortonese community. (Event related to sentences 22 and 25)\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: Philip's state is one of confusion and apprehension. He is disturbed from his peaceful life by a mysterious message, indicating a downturn from his initial state of tranquility.\n- **Event 2**: Philip's state becomes more engaged and determined. He is no longer just a passive recipient of a mysterious message but is actively seeking to understand and resolve the mystery, showing an improvement from the state of confusion.\n- **Event 3**: Philip's state is one of increasing tension and risk. Discovering the link to Vicente Russo brings back old, potentially dangerous conflicts, indicating a decline in his state of well-being compared to the determination and engagement of the previous event.\n- **Event 4**: Philip's state is one of high tension and danger. Confronting a ruthless kingpin puts him in direct peril, representing a further decline from the previous state of increasing tension.\n- **Event 5**: Philip's state improves significantly. He not only solves the mystery and apprehends the villain but also decides to shed his secluded existence, embracing a more participative role in the community.

Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, it can be observed that Philip starts in a peaceful but somewhat isolated state, falls into a dilemma with the arrival of the mysterious package, and then navigates through increasing danger and tension before ultimately resolving the conflict and achieving a higher state of integration and well-being. This pattern, where the protagonist falls into a problem and then finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning, aligns with the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc type.\n\n### 4.

rumors claim that the spirits torment any nurses and doctors who dare enter.\n4) Rowena has hired Joyce to commune with her daughter Alicia, who committed suicide after Alicia's fiancé, chef Maxime Gerard, ended their engagement.\n5) Among the guests are Rowena's housekeeper Olga Seminoff, Drake family doctor Leslie Ferrier and his son Leopold, and Joyce's Romani assistant Desdemona Holland; they are joined by Maxime right before the séance, and during it Poirot reveals Desdemona's half-brother Nicholas—and Joyce's second assistant—hiding in the chimney.\n6) Joyce suddenly speaks in Alicia's voice, saying that one of the guests murdered her.\n7) Poirot confronts Joyce, who insists he lighten up, gives him her mask and robe, and cryptically says they will not meet again.\n8) Seconds later, an unknown assailant nearly drowns Poirot when he is apple bobbing, while Joyce falls from an upper story and is impaled on a courtyard statue.\n9) With a storm cutting off the palazzo, Poirot interviews the guests, during which he witnesses manifestations of Alicia's ghost and hears a young girl humming a tune.\n10) The investigation yields perplexing results:   Leslie, severely traumatized by his experiences at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, is in love with Rowena.\n11) Maxime, who was not initially invited, ended his and Alicia's engagement because Rowena disapproved of him, and Alicia was obsessed with keeping her mother happy.\n12) Nicholas and Desdemona have been stealing from Joyce, intending to travel to St. Louis, Missouri, which they became enamoured with after partly seeing Meet Me in St. Louis at a displaced persons camp.\n13) Leopold claims to hear the same voice(s) Poirot has been hearing, a claim later also made by Leslie.When the guests discover an underground chamber containing children's skeletal remains and bees, Leslie suffers a panic attack and nearly kills Maxime.\n14) He is locked inside the music room to recover, Rowena giving Poirot the only key.\n15) After examining Maxime's invitation, Poirot deduces Ariadne sent it and is conspiring with Vitale: Vitale, who investigated Alicia's death and resigned from the police as a result of the case, gave Joyce private details, while Ariadne had hoped to use Poirot's inability to explain the supernatural as a plot for her next book.\n16) Leslie is then found dead with a knife in his back.\n17) Gathering the remaining guests, Poirot reveals Rowena caused the deaths of Alicia, Joyce, and Leslie, hoping to pass them off as part of the children's curse.\n18) Obsessed with keeping Alicia for herself, Rowena poisoned her with small doses of the honey of Rhododendron ponticum, weakening and then caring for a hallucinating Alicia (the same honey seemingly caused Poirot's visions) to isolate her from Maxime when they planned to reconcile; the night of Alicia's suicide, Olga unknowingly gave Alicia tea containing a fatal dose and Rowena, fearful of exposure, staged everything.\n19) When blackmail threats arrived, Rowena suspected either Joyce or Leslie.\n20) She attempted to drown Poirot, realized that she had mistaken him for Joyce, and then pushed Joyce to her death.\n21) Later, over the palazzo's internal phone line, she forced Leslie to stab himself by threatening to kill Leopold.\n22) When Poirot confronts Rowena on the roof, Alicia's ghost seems to appear to them both, pulling Rowena down off the building and into the canal where she drowns.\n23) As dawn breaks, Poirot parts ways with Ariadne and chooses not to report Vitale's fraud.\n24) Later, Poirot privately confronts young Leopold, the true blackmailer who needed to support himself and his father: Leopold had identified the poisoning signs that his physician father missed and realized Rowena's first starring role was in an opera whose lead character is the \"king of poisons\".\n25) Poirot suggests Leopold and Olga clear their consciences by financially helping the Hollands begin anew in St. Louis.\n26) His faith mostly restored, Poirot returns home to accept new cases.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better (e.g., 0→1→2→4→10)\n- Riches to Rags: Protagonist starts high and ends lower (e.g., 10→9→8→6→0)\n- Man in a Hole: Protagonist falls into trouble but recovers (e.g., 6→2→1→4→10)\n- Icarus: Protagonist rises then falls dramatically (e.g., 2→4→9→5→1)\n- Double Man in a Hole: Two cycles of fall and recovery (e.g., 6→2→7→4→10)\n- Cinderella: Rise, setback, ultimate triumph (e.g., 1→7→4→1→10)\n- Oedipus: Start high, fall, recover, final fall (e.g., 10→4→7→9→1)",

His state improves as he begins to see the comedic potential in his nightmares and decides to act on it.\n- **Event 5 (The Movie's Success and Jordan's Transformation)**: The success of the movie and Jordan's role in it lead to a significant improvement in his state. He is no longer controlled by his fears but instead uses them as material for comedy, showing a substantial improvement in his condition.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc can be classified based on the trajectory of the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. Jordan starts in a disadvantaged state (fear and distress due to nightmares), faces challenges, and through his journey, ends up in a much better state (facing and overcoming his fears, finding success and laughter). This pattern, where the protagonist's condition improves from the beginning to the end, aligning with overcoming initial disadvantages to achieve a better state, fits the **Rags to Riches** story arc type. The key elements here are the transformation from a state of fear to one of confidence and success, and the use of his nightmares as a catalyst for this change, which is a hallmark of the **Rags to Riches** narrative.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Kelly Ferguson. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. Kelly is tasked with babysitting Jacob and learns about the monsters that plague him (sentences 3-6).\n2. Kelly discovers that the monsters are real and Jacob is abducted by them (sentence 7).\n3. Kelly joins a secret society of babysitters and they embark on a mission to rescue Jacob from the Boogeyman (sentences 9-12).\n4. Kelly and the society face setbacks, including the Boogeyman's trap and Liz's capture, but Kelly continues her quest to rescue Jacob (sentences 24-30).\n5. Kelly successfully rescues Jacob, defeats the Boogeyman, and returns Jacob home, earning commendation and potential membership in the Order of Babysitters (sentences 31-35).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **Initial State**: Kelly is in a somewhat disadvantaged situation, still known as \"Monster Girl\" and dealing with the aftermath of her childhood trauma. However, she's about to take on a babysitting job, which could be seen as a step towards normalcy or redemption.\n2. **Discovery of Real Monsters**: Kelly's state worsens as she discovers the reality of the monsters and fails to protect Jacob, leading to his abduction. This is a significant downturn in her condition.\n3. **Joining the Secret Society**: Kelly's condition improves as she finds allies and a new purpose in rescuing Jacob. She's now part of a group that understands her experiences and is working towards a common goal.\n4. **Facing Setbacks**: Kelly faces challenges and setbacks, including traps and the capture of her new ally, Liz. Her condition worsens due to these obstacles, but she persists in her mission.\n5. **Successful Rescue**: Kelly's condition significantly improves as she successfully rescues Jacob, defeats the Boogeyman, and is commended for her efforts. She also receives recognition and potential membership in the Order of Babysitters, along with personal benefits like a potential romantic relationship.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc can be classified based on the changes in Kelly's condition throughout the narrative. Initially, Kelly is in a disadvantaged state, but as the story progresses, she faces a significant downturn (the abduction of Jacob), then improves as she joins the secret society and works towards rescuing Jacob. Despite facing setbacks, Kelly ultimately succeeds in her mission, leading to a significant improvement in her condition.\n\nThis pattern resembles the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (the abduction of Jacob and the realization of the monsters' existence) but then finds a way out, ending in a better state than at the beginning. Kelly's journey from being haunted by her past and known as \"Monster Girl\" to becoming a hero who defeats the Boogeyman and earns recognition aligns with this arc.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To classify the story arc type, let's break down the story into its key components as per your instructions.\n\n1. **Identify the protagonist and 5 major events:**\n   - The protagonist is Madison, an 18-year-old violin student at Juilliard.\n   - Five major events in the story are:\n     1. Madison feels overwhelmed by her struggles and decides to step out for a walk, leading her to The Blue Note jazz club (sentence 5).\n     2. She meets George, a saxophonist, and is inspired by his raw, passionate melodies (sentence 7).\n     3. Madison confesses her romantic feelings to George, but he defensively deflects her confession due to fear of societal backlash (sentence 15).\n     4. Madison prepares for her final performance at Juilliard, choosing to perform an unprecedented piece that fuses classical music with jazz (sentence 19).\n     5. George joins Madison on stage for a spontaneous jazz-violin duet, and their performance resonates deeply with the audience (sentence 23).\n\n2. **Describe the protagonist's state and how it changed at each event:**\n   - At event 1, Madison is feeling overwhelmed and trapped by her rigid practice regimen, lacking a sense of fulfillment in her music. Her state is one of dissatisfaction and longing for something more.\n   - At event 2, after meeting George and being inspired by his music, Madison's state changes to one of inspiration and hope. She starts to see a different path for her music, one that involves more passion and spontaneity.\n   - At event 3, following George's rejection of her romantic confession, Madison's state shifts to one of hurt and possibly doubt about her feelings and decisions. This rejection adds a personal dimension to her struggle, making her question not just her music, but also her relationships.\n   - At event 4, as Madison prepares for her final performance, her state is one of determination and courage. Despite the personal setback with George, she decides to take a risk with her music, blending classical and jazz in a way that could either succeed greatly or fail.\n   - At event 5, with George joining her on stage and their performance being well-received, Madison's state changes to one of triumph and validation. Not only does she find success in her musical risk-taking, but she also finds a form of redemption and acceptance in her relationship with George.\n\n3. **Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain the reasoning:**\n   - The story starts with Madison in a state of dissatisfaction and longing (a kind of \"hole\" she's in), feeling unfulfilled by her strict musical regimen.\n   - She then experiences a series of ups and downs: finding inspiration, facing rejection, taking a risk, and ultimately finding success and validation.\n   - The key characteristic of Madison's journey is that she falls into a dilemma (her dissatisfaction with her music and later the rejection by George) and then finds a way out, ending in a better state than where she began. This pattern fits the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc type, where the protagonist's condition improves from the first turning point to the last turning point, as they navigate through challenges to reach a higher state of being or success.\n\n4. **Determined story arc type:**\nMan in a Hole"

        "output": "To analyze the story arc, we first need to identify the protagonist. Given the context, Jessie, the florist, seems to be the central character around whom many events revolve, especially at the beginning and end of the story.\n\n### 1. Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\n\nThe protagonist: Jessie, the florist.\n\n5 Major Events:\n1. Jessie gets dumped mid-parachute jump and crashes into a wedding (sentence 1).\n2. Jessie is hired as a wedding planner by Liz (sentence 3).\n3. Jessie and Lawrence Phillips, another wedding planner, start to butt heads due to their different views (sentence 6).\n4. Jessie tries to hire a band (Mack and Lenny) for the wedding and ends up developing feelings for Mack (sentences 18 and 22).\n5. The wedding and its reception, where all the storylines converge (implied by the culmination of events leading to sentences 19-26).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **Event 1 (Dumped and Crashing a Wedding):** Jessie is in a state of shock and embarrassment. Her condition is low due to the public humiliation and the unexpected turn of events.\n2. **Event 2 (Hired as a Wedding Planner):** Jessie's condition improves as she is given an unexpected opportunity. This is a turning point where her situation starts to look better.\n3. **Event 3 (Butting Heads with Lawrence):** Jessie faces a challenge and her condition could be seen as slightly worsening due to the conflict, but she is still in a better position than at the start.\n4. **Event 4 (Developing Feelings for Mack):** Jessie's personal life starts to improve as she develops feelings for someone. This indicates a positive change in her condition.\n5. **Event 5 (The Wedding and Its Reception):** Although the story doesn't detail Jessie's state at the end explicitly, it can be inferred that she overcomes her initial humiliation and professional challenges, ending in a better state than where she started, considering her personal and professional growth.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the progression of Jessie's condition, she starts in a disadvantaged situation (publicly humiliated and heartbroken), faces challenges (conflict with Lawrence, difficulty finding a band for the wedding), but ultimately ends in a better situation (finding love, succeeding in her role as a wedding planner). This pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist faces difficulties but ultimately rises above them, indicating improvement from the start to the end.\n\nThe \"Double Man in a Hole\" story arc is characterized by the protagonist facing two cycles of dilemma and recovery. While Jessie does face multiple challenges, the overall narrative provided does not clearly outline two distinct cycles of falling into a dilemma and then recovering, which would be necessary for a \"Double Man in a Hole\" classification. Instead, Jessie's story seems more aligned with a narrative where she faces a series of challenges but overall trends upwards, improving her condition from the beginning to the end.\n\nHowever, considering the provided classification and re-evaluating, if we interpret Jessie's journey as facing significant setbacks (the initial dump and crash, the conflict with Lawrence) and then recovering (finding a new opportunity, developing feelings for Mack), one could argue for a \"Double Man in a Hole\" if these are seen as two distinct cycles of dilemma and recovery. But based on the direct interpretation of the story provided, it seems more like a straightforward improvement from a low point to a high point, without clear indication of two full cycles of downturn and recovery.\n\nGiven the nature of the story and focusing strictly on Jessie's arc, a more fitting interpretation might lean towards a \"Man in a Hole\" or even a \"Rags to Riches\" story arc due to her overall improvement from the start to the end. However, the task suggests classifying based on provided information and reasoning through the story's complexities.\n\n### 4. Determined Story Arc Type\n\nDouble Man in Hole"

Five major events in the story can be identified as follows:\n\n1. **Christopher's Car Breaks Down**: When Christopher's four-wheel-drive comes to a standstill on a quiet county road in southern Georgia.\n2. **Meeting John Doe and Entering 'The Fun Factory'**: When Christopher meets John Doe and accepts his invitation to stay at 'The Fun Factory', an abandoned amusement park.\n3. **Discovery of the Dark Past and Animatronics**: When Christopher uncovers the dark history of 'The Fun Factory' and discovers the life-sized animatronic dolls.\n4. **The Animatronics Come to Life**: When the animatronics take on a malicious disposition and Christopher realizes he must fight for his life.\n5. **Escape and Burning of 'The Fun Factory'**: When Christopher outsmarts the animatronics, defeats John, and burns down 'The Fun Factory' before escaping.\n\n### 2. Description of Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Car Breaks Down)**: Christopher is in a state of shock and vulnerability. His reliable car, which is likely his means of safety and mobility, has failed him, leaving him stranded in an ominous location.\n- **Event 2 (Meets John and Enters 'The Fun Factory')**: Christopher's state changes to one of cautious curiosity. He is exhausted and seeking help, but the eerie environment of 'The Fun Factory' introduces a sense of unease and foreboding.\n- **Event 3 (Discovers Dark Past and Animatronics)**: Christopher's state deteriorates to fear and apprehension. The discovery of the dark past and the animatronic dolls increases his sense of danger and unease.\n- **Event 4 (Animatronics Come to Life)**: Christopher's state becomes one of extreme fear and desperation. The animatronics' malicious behavior puts him in immediate danger, forcing him to fight for survival.\n- **Event 5 (Escape and Burning of 'The Fun Factory')**: Christopher's state improves to one of relief and empowerment. He has managed to outsmart his enemies, escape the dangerous situation, and even take revenge by burning down 'The Fun Factory'.\n\n### 3. Classification of Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, the narrative follows a pattern where Christopher falls into a dilemma (his car breaking down and getting trapped in 'The Fun Factory' with dangerous animatronics) and then finds a way out, ending in a better state than when he started (having overcome his fears, defeated his enemies, and escaped). This pattern matches the **Man in a Hole** story arc, where the protagonist's condition improves from the first turning point (the car breaking down) to the last turning point (escaping and burning down 'The Fun Factory'). The story shows Christopher facing significant challenges, hitting a low point when the animatronics come to life, but ultimately recovering and emerging victorious.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story appears to be General Jordan Mathews, as the narrative revolves around his actions and decisions in response to the global crisis. However, it's also arguable that the protagonist could be considered as President John Harper or even the collective team of Operation Phoenix, given the story's focus on their formation and mission. For the purpose of analysis, let's focus on General Jordan Mathews as the primary protagonist.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. The introduction of the global crisis and General Mathews' proposal to President Harper (sentences 1-7).\n2. President Harper's consideration and authorization of Operation Phoenix (sentences 8-12).\n3. General Mathews' recruitment of unique individuals for the operation (sentences 13-16).\n4. The assembly and showcasing of the team's abilities (sentence 16).\n5. The team's relocation to an underground base for training and operations (sentence 18-19).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n1. **Introduction of the Crisis**: General Mathews is faced with a dire global situation, proposing a radical solution to President Harper. His state is one of urgency and concern.\n2. **Authorization of Operation Phoenix**: With President Harper's approval, Mathews' proposal is validated, and he is tasked with a critical mission. His state improves as he gains the go-ahead for his plan.\n3. **Recruitment**: Mathews is in the process of gathering a team, which is a challenging but hopeful phase. His state is engaged and proactive.\n4. **Assembly and Showcase**: Seeing the team's potential and capabilities, Mathews likely feels a sense of accomplishment and optimism. His state is positive, with a sense of potential success.\n5. **Relocation to the Base**: With the team assembled and relocated, Mathews has successfully initiated the operation. His state is one of readiness and anticipation for the challenges ahead.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the progression of General Mathews' state throughout the story, it starts with a sense of urgency and concern due to the global crisis, which can be considered a low point. As the story progresses and Operation Phoenix is authorized, assembled, and initiated, Mathews' state improves, reflecting a sense of purpose, accomplishment, and hope for resolving the crisis. This improvement from a low point to a higher point, with the protagonist finding a way out of the initial dilemma (the global crisis) by forming and initiating Operation Phoenix, aligns with the **Man in a Hole** story arc type. The protagonist falls into a dilemma (the crisis) and finds a way out (by forming and starting Operation Phoenix), ending in a better state than at the beginning.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To classify the story arc type, let's first identify the protagonist and key events in the story.\n\n1. **Protagonist Identification and Major Events:**\n   - The protagonist of the story is Barry Allen (the Flash).\n   - Five major events in the story are:\n     1. Barry Allen is disrupted from his picnic with Iris West by Superman fighting Brainiac (Event 1).\n     2. Barry travels back in time and meets the Justice Society of America (JSA) (Event 2).\n     3. Barry learns he is in a parallel reality and that he needs to learn a lesson and accomplish a mission before he can return (Event 3).\n     4. The JSA, with Barry's help, uncovers a trap set by the Advisor controlling Aquaman and leading to a significant battle (Event 4).\n     5. Barry helps the JSA defeat the villains, says goodbye, and returns to his own time, proposing to Iris (Event 5).\n\n2. **Protagonist's State at Each Event:**\n   - **Event 1:** Barry's state is one of disruption from a peaceful outing, indicating a neutral to slightly negative state due to the interruption.\n   - **Event 2:** Barry's state changes to one of confusion and then excitement as he discovers the JSA and a new mission, indicating an improvement in his state due to the adventure and purpose.\n   - **Event 3:** Barry's state becomes more complex as he realizes he is in a parallel reality, introducing a sense of disorientation and challenge, which can be seen as a slight downturn due to the uncertainty and the task ahead.\n   - **Event 4:** Barry faces significant challenges as the team battles against overwhelming odds, indicating a low point due to the danger and complexity of the situation.\n   - **Event 5:** Barry's state improves dramatically as he succeeds in his mission, finds a way back home, and proposes to Iris, indicating a high point of success and personal fulfillment.\n\n3. **Story Arc Type Classification:**\n   - The story starts with Barry in a neutral state (picnic with Iris), then he falls into a dilemma (disruption by Brainiac, time travel, and the challenges in the parallel universe), and finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning (success in the mission and personal life). This pattern aligns with the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist faces a problem, hits a low point, but ultimately recovers and ends in a better state than where they started.\n\n4. **Determined Story Arc Type:**\nMan in a Hole"

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Robert Freeman, a renowned New York attorney. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Robert receives a mysterious call about his son Tyler** (sentence 5-7): This event sets off the chain of actions Robert takes to find his son.\n2. **Robert finds Tyler's sketchpad and realizes his son is missing** (sentence 9): This marks the beginning of Robert's desperate search for Tyler.\n3. **Robert discovers a cryptic note from Tyler leading to a dilapidated tenement** (sentence 17-18): This event introduces a clue that guides Robert's search and involves him deeper in the mystery.\n4. **Robert, along with Mia and the old man, confronts the kidnappers and rescues Tyler** (sentence 34-38): This is the climax of the story where Robert's actions lead to the rescue of his son.\n5. **Robert decides to leave his legal profession to focus on his relationship with Tyler** (sentence 42-45): This event signifies a change in Robert's life priorities and marks the beginning of his healing and rebuilding process with his son.\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1 (Mysterious Call)**: Robert's state changes from being a successful, albeit distant, father and attorney to someone faced with a mysterious and potentially dangerous situation regarding his son. His condition worsens as he feels a \"chill of dread.\"\n- **Event 2 (Finding Sketchpad)**: Robert's state deteriorates further as he realizes his son is missing. The harsh reality of his situation sets in, and his feelings of guilt and desperation intensify.\n- **Event 3 (Discovering Cryptic Note)**: Robert's state begins to shift slightly as he finds a lead in the search for his son. Although still desperate and worried, he now has a direction and hope, which slightly improves his condition.\n- **Event 4 (Confronting Kidnappers)**: Robert's state improves significantly as he rescues his son. The relief and joy of being reunited with Tyler mark a turning point where Robert's condition begins to improve substantially.\n- **Event 5 (Leaving Legal Profession)**: Robert's state continues to improve as he decides to prioritize his relationship with his son. This decision reflects a personal growth and a commitment to change, indicating that Robert's condition has improved from where it started, both in terms of his personal life and his relationship with Tyler.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the description of Robert's state throughout the major events, the story arc can be classified as a \"Man in a Hole.\" This classification is chosen because Robert starts in a relatively good position as a successful attorney but falls into a dilemma (his son's disappearance) that worsens his condition (feelings of guilt, desperation, and fear). However, through his actions and decisions, Robert finds a way out of this dilemma (rescuing his son and deciding to change his life priorities), ending in a better state than where he began. The key characteristic of the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc is the protagonist's fall into a difficult situation followed by a rise to a better condition than before, which aligns with Robert's journey from a successful but distant father to a more involved and caring one after facing and overcoming the challenge of his son's disappearance.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To classify the story arc type, let's first identify the protagonist and 5 major events in the story.\n\nThe protagonist in the story is Edmond Murray, the absent father who is called to the site of his son Ethan's disappearance.\n\nHere are 5 major events in the story:\n\n1. Edmond is called to the site of his son Ethan's disappearance (sentence 1).\n2. Edmond discovers videos of Ethan on Frank's phone, leading him to investigate further (sentence 8).\n3. Edmond finds and interrogates William O'Connor, learning about the kidnapping ring and his son's location (sentences 12-14).\n4. Edmond rescues his son Ethan from the kidnappers at the hilltop lodge (sentences 18-22).\n5. Edmond is arrested by Inspector Roy for his part in the illegal activities of his company, despite his heroic actions (sentences 26-29).\n\nNow, let's analyze the protagonist's state at each event and how it changed relative to the previous events:\n\nAt event 1, Edmond is in a state of distress and concern for his missing son. His state is low due to his feelings of guilt and anxiety.\n\nAt event 2, Edmond's state becomes more determined and focused on finding his son. He has discovered a lead and is taking action to investigate, which improves his state slightly.\n\nAt event 3, Edmond's state becomes more intense and desperate as he learns about the kidnapping ring and his son's location. He is willing to take risks and use aggressive means to rescue his son, which shows a sense of urgency and desperation.\n\nAt event 4, Edmond's state improves significantly as he rescues his son and reunites with him. This is a peak moment in the story, and Edmond's state is high due to his relief and joy.\n\nAt event 5, Edmond's state falls again as he is arrested and faces consequences for his actions. Despite his heroic rescue of his son, he is still held accountable for his past mistakes, which lowers his state.\n\nBased on this analysis, the story arc type can be classified as follows:\n\nThe protagonist's condition starts low (distress and concern), improves slightly (determined and focused), becomes more intense and desperate (willing to take risks), peaks (rescues his son), and then falls again (arrested and facing consequences). This pattern matches the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc type, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (his son's disappearance) and finds a way out (rescuing his son), but ultimately ends up in a lower state than expected (arrested).\n\nMan in Hole"

        "input": "Story, broken down into numbered sentences:\n1) Lyme Regis, a picturesque seaside town in Dorset, serves as a backdrop for our story, home to young Annie, an effervescent girl who held a unique fascination for all things marine life.\n2) With a fondness for fossils that surpassed the conventional for her tender age, she was drawn perpetually to explore, investigate, and collect such marine remnants.\n3) Annie lived with her widowed mother, Belinda, who was as strong-spirited as they come.\n4) Over the years, however, Belinda's health had started to deteriorate due to an inexplicable ailment.\n5) To manage their livelihood and to fund Belinda's treatment, mother and daughter ran a small trinket store on the bustling main street.\n6) Here, they sold an assortment of sea curios, aged maps, and exotic seashells that brought to life the vibrant maritime soul of Lyme Regis.\n7) One day, a twist in their otherwise normal life came in the form of an esteemed geologist, Mr. Hamilton.\n8) The renowned individual decided to leave behind the noisy streets of London to investigate the abundant Jurassic fossils prevalent in Lyme Regis.\n9) During a chance walk-in to the trinket store, Hamilton was taken aback by the depth of Annie's understanding of fossils, the species they belonged to, and their geological eras, an understanding far greater than what one would expect from a girl her age.\n10) Surprised and intrigued by her innate talent, Hamilton offered Annie an unheard-of opportunity: to assist him on an expansive fossil excavation project on the cliffs neighboring the town - a proposition that immensely excites Annie.\n11) However, just as Annie's dreams began soaring, they were doused by mother Belinda's rapidly failing health.\n12) The uncertain clouds of sorrow cast a shadow on Annie's initial fossil discovery victories.\n13) Annie found herself at a crossroads.\n14) On one hand, she was being pulled into the realm of her dreams, her passion for fossils.\n15) On the other hand, her mother's deteriorating condition demanded her attention and care.\n16) Unable to resist the allure of unearthing the earth's ancient secrets, Annie decided to uphold her commitment to Hamilton, keeping her worried thoughts at bay to sustain her blooming enthusiasm for paleontology.\n17) As Annie started to dig deeper into the cliffy realms, she and Hamilton stumbled upon an astonishing discovery — a colossal fossil, seamlessly embraced by the stony facades of the cliff.\n18) This fossil, a detailed artifact that seemed to be from an era unknown to them, foretold groundbreaking revelations about Lyme Regis' prehistoric past.\n19) Amidst the elation of the extraordinary discovery, Annie was weighed down by guilt and worry as her mother's health continued to worsen with each passing day.\n20) To assist with the highly skilled and delicate task of unearthing the intricate fossil, they enlisted the help of Samuel, a local ivory-carver who was renowned for his craft.\n21) Working close together, Annie and Samuel discovered a shared passion for prehistory that gradually blossomed into a romantic bond.\n22) Their companionship during long days at the excavation site evolved into an unexpected love affair.\n23) This newfound love, however, ruffled Mr. Hamilton, who became fearful of losing both his prestige and Annie, whom he had come to desire.\n24) He feared that his renowned status as a prominent geologist was in jeopardy.\n25) Blinded by jealousy, Hamilton proposed a rushed marriage to Annie, seeking to assert his control over her and her unique talent.\n26) He aimed to continue reaping the benefits of her phenomenal work without having his authority undermined.\n27) But Annie, recognizing Hamilton's deceit and validating her growing bond with Samuel, vehemently rejected Hamilton’s proposal, standing up for her own worth and happiness.\n28) The rejection wounded Hamilton's pride, propelling him to hatch a treacherous plan to clandestinely steal the fossil and claim sole credit for the discovery.\n29) Then, under the cover of the dark, Hamilton attempted to enact his plan, sneaking into the excavation site to collect the fossil.\n30) Fortunately, Samuel and Annie, who had been working late, caught Hamilton red-handed in the middle of his theft.\n31) The still night was rent by the altercation that ensued, echoing their scathing accusations against Hamilton.\n32) Pinned under the weight of his own actions, Hamilton was forced to abandon his plans, making a disgraced exit from Lyme Regis without the fossil.\n33) In the midst of this upheaval, unexpectedly, Annie received unsettling news about her mother's condition, now critical than ever.\n34) Overcome with anxiety, she rushed homeward, hoping to stand by her mother's side during these testing times.\n35) There, in their humble abode, a fading Belinda urged her daughter to pursue her extraordinary work without any guilt, assuring her that it filled her with immense pride.\n36) With this final whisper of love and encouragement, Belinda drew her last breath, her spirit finally freed from the mortal world.\n37) With Belinda's demise, news of Annie's exceptional marine find reached renowned geologists in London who decided to personally meet this extraordinary girl who had made such a remarkable discovery.\n38) As the solemn ceremony of Belinda’s funeral took place, these geologists arrived at Lyme Regis, their curiosity piqued by the groundbreaking fossil find.\n39) The expert team sincerely appreciated Annie's unprecedented diligence and her remarkable findings in the field of geology, commending her for her insights and determination.\n40) Impressed by her remarkable skill and passion, they offered her a golden opportunity to expand her horizons by inviting her to study at the leading geoscience institute in London.\n41) However, taking a stand that would have made her mother proud, Annie declined the prestigious offer with grace, choosing to honour Belinda's wishes by continuing her extraordinary work in Lyme Regis.\n42) Their modest trinket store underwent a transformation, not just serving as a maritime curio shop, but also standing as a beacon of dedication and homage to her late mother.\n43) Amidst these turning tides, Annie and Samuel’s bond deepened.\n44) Their shared expertise, their deep-seated love, and their common adversaries laid the foundation for a relationship of support, trust, and companionship.\n45) Navigating through such a whirlwind, Annie remained rooted in her passion for paleontology.\n46) Together with Samuel, she aptly handled the trinket store, which gradually became a popular spot among locals and visitors to Lyme Regis due to their infectious enthusiasm for prehistory.\n47) Amid the triumphs and trials, their love story beautifully unfolded, painting a narrative of shared victories, admiration, perseverance, and a love that, against all odds, found its roots amid adversity.\n48) Lyme Regis, the harboring domain for their shared passion and the nurturing grounds for their deep-seated love, became their home.\n49) Standing strong amidst societal pressures and adversities, they ushered a new horizon of paleontological research in Lyme Regis with their unwavering dedication and expertise.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches:

Annie is offered an opportunity to assist Mr. Hamilton on a fossil excavation project (sentence 10).\n2. Annie's mother's health rapidly fails, causing Annie distress (sentence 11).\n3. Annie and Mr. Hamilton discover a colossal, unknown fossil (sentence 17).\n4. Annie rejects Mr. Hamilton's proposal and he attempts to steal the fossil, leading to his downfall (sentences 27 and 32).\n5. Annie's mother passes away, but she receives an offer to study at a leading geoscience institute in London, which she declines to continue her work in Lyme Regis (sentences 36 and 40).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1:** Annie is excited and her dreams are soaring as she is given the opportunity to work on the fossil project. Her state is positive and hopeful.\n- **Event 2:** Annie's state changes to one of distress and worry due to her mother's failing health. This introduces a conflict between her personal and professional aspirations.\n- **Event 3:** The discovery of the colossal fossil brings Annie elation and professional success, despite her ongoing personal worries. Her state improves in terms of professional fulfillment but remains complicated by personal concerns.\n- **Event 4:** Rejecting Mr. Hamilton's proposal and foiling his attempt to steal the fossil marks a significant personal and professional victory for Annie. Her state improves as she stands up for herself and her work, and she finds support in her relationship with Samuel.\n- **Event 5:** After her mother's passing, Annie experiences grief but also finds a sense of resolution and dedication to her work and her mother's memory. Declining the London offer to stay in Lyme Regis shows her commitment to her roots and her personal growth. Her state is one of sadness but also of determination and independence.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc can be classified based on the changes in Annie's state throughout the narrative. Initially, Annie is in a positive state with a promising opportunity (Event 1). Then, she faces a setback with her mother's health issues (Event 2), which complicates her situation. However, she experiences professional success and personal growth with the fossil discovery and her relationship with Samuel (Events 3 and 4). Finally, despite the sadness of her mother's death, Annie achieves a higher state of independence, professional dedication, and personal fulfillment (Event 5).\n\nThis pattern follows the **Cinderella** story arc type, where the protagonist rises to a promising start, faces setbacks, and ultimately achieves a higher state than where they began. Annie's journey from a young girl with a passion for fossils to a determined and independent individual who honors her mother's memory while pursuing her dreams embodies this arc.\n\n### 4.

the miniaturized model undergoes a rapid metamorphosis, expanding into an impeccably replicated full-scale G-19 Hawk aircraft bursting with tiny, proportionate passengers.\n7) Taking everyone off guard, the plane's engines thunder into action, propelling it gliding across his living room floor and out through his unanticipatedly large, Victorian-era bay window.\n8) The pilotless aircraft miraculously navigates its way around the city's towering skyline, demonstrating swift and precise maneuvering skills while earning incredulous stares from the city's bustling crowd of residents.\n9) Fearful of the potential catastrophe an errant, uncontrolled aircraft could cause in a densely populated city, Daryl along with a bewildered Chloe conjure up a hasty but essential plan for their impromptu mission - Locate and recover the full-size airplane model now darting around their city.\n10) Their compelling mission takes them on a wild chase across bustling city squares, tucked-away back alleys, and iconic green parks of their own city, hidden corners of which were until then unknown to them.\n11) All the while, they keep an eager eye out for any sightings of the erratic G-19 Hawk.\n12) Their fast-paced adventure intersects the lives of the varied city populace including curious corporate employees, perturbed pedestrians, and wide-eyed children, all expressing their individual reactions to the gasp-worthy spectacle unfolding right before their eyes.\n13) This little plane, which has now become a cherished city celebrity, selects the grand statue of the city's founding mayor as its operational base.\n14) The aircraft's acrobatic stunts around the statue invoke contagious laughter and energetic conversations amongst the onlooking crowd.\n15) Taking note of the palpable joy his inadvertent creation is stirring up, Daryl is confronted with a challenging decision: to put an end to the mini-plane's aerial shenanigans forever or to let it continue.\n16) In the end, he puts a responsible foot forward by deciding to return the lovable airplane and its tiny occupants to their original miniature state using the remaining bit of Gulliver's Juice.\n17) When the gliding airplane takes a playful plunge towards Daryl's duo, he strategically tosses the potion onto it.\n18) This sets off a breathtaking mid-air magical transition where the plane is briefly shrouded in cascading shimmers of stardust before gradually shrinking down to a fraction of its size.\n19) The G-19 Hawk, post its enchanting journey across the city skies, returns to its original miniature size, along with its troop of diminutive passengers, and gently descends into Daryl's welcoming palms.\n20) Amidst deafening cheers and the infectious laughter of the onlooking crowd, a triumphant Daryl and an out-of-breath Chloe make their jovial return home.\n21) Their chaotic pursuit lasting an entire day which turned into an unexpected citywide entertainment.\n22) Once back in the tranquility of their home, they decide to memorialize the day's adventure by strategically positioning the G-19 Hawk model alongside Daryl's meticulously crafted miniatures atop their mantle.\n23) As the strange day finally comes to a close, it concludes with a merry audience still relishing the surprises thrown their way during the day, etching a memorable imprint on the fascinatingly entertaining day.\n24) As the madness of the day finally subsides, Daryl and Chloe find themselves caught up in bouts of roaring laughter reminiscing about the ridiculous situations they encountered all courtesy of their mini-passenger packed G-19 Hawk, their laughter proving to be a fitting melody echoing throughout their apartment.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better (e.g., 0→1→2→4→10)\n- Riches to Rags: Protagonist starts high and ends lower (e.g., 10→9→8→6→0)\n- Man in a Hole: Protagonist falls into trouble but recovers (e.g., 6→2→1→4→10)\n- Icarus: Protagonist rises then falls dramatically (e.g., 2→4→9→5→1)\n- Double Man in a Hole: Two cycles of fall and recovery (e.g., 6→2→7→4→10)\n- Cinderella: Rise, setback, ultimate triumph (e.g., 1→7→4→1→10)\n- Oedipus: Start high, fall, recover, final fall (e.g., 10→4→7→9→1)",
        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Daryl, a diligent data analyst. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. Daryl purchases the blueprint of a G-19 Hawk model airplane.\n2. Daryl's existence becomes dominated by the model, causing him to skip meals and sleep, leading to concern from his roommate Chloe.\n3. Daryl inadvertently spills \"Gulliver's Juice\" on the model, causing it to transform into a full-scale aircraft.\n4. Daryl and Chloe embark on a mission to locate and recover the full-size airplane model as it navigates the city.\n5. Daryl decides to return the airplane to its miniature state using the remaining Gulliver's Juice.\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: Daryl is in a state of fascination and hobbyist interest. His condition is one of curiosity and engagement, which is a positive state.\n- **Event 2**: Daryl's condition worsens as his obsession with the model starts to negatively impact his health and relationships. This indicates a decline in his overall well-being.\n- **Event 3**: The accidental transformation of the model into a full-scale aircraft introduces chaos and unpredictability into Daryl's life. His state becomes one of surprise and potential trouble, which is a low point.\n- **Event 4**: Daryl and Chloe's mission to recover the airplane model is a response to the chaos introduced in the previous event. Daryl's state is one of action and problem-solving, indicating an attempt to regain control over the situation. This can be seen as a step towards recovery from the previous low point.\n- **Event 5**: By deciding to return the airplane to its miniature state, Daryl takes a responsible step that resolves the chaos and allows him to regain control over his life. This decision leads to a positive outcome, where Daryl and Chloe are hailed as part of a citywide entertainment, and they end the day on a note of laughter and memorialization of their adventure.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. Initially, Daryl is in a positive state (curiosity and engagement with the model). His condition then worsens (obsession negatively impacting his life), followed by a significant downturn (chaos with the full-scale aircraft). However, he then takes action to solve the problem (mission to recover the airplane), and finally, he makes a decision that leads to a positive resolution (returning the airplane to its miniature state and enjoying the aftermath).\n\nThis pattern follows the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (the chaos with the airplane) and then finds a way out, ending in a better state than before the dilemma began. Daryl's condition improves from the point of the airplane's transformation to the final resolution, where he not only resolves the immediate problem but also ends up with a memorable and positive experience.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To classify the story arc type, we first need to identify the protagonist in the story. The protagonist can be considered as Konga, the monkey who undergoes significant transformations and experiences throughout the narrative.\n\n1. **Identify 5 major events in the story:**\n   - Event 1: The monkey is experimented on with KTNT (sentence 11).\n   - Event 2: The monkey is set free by Professor Mills as the facility is attacked (sentence 13).\n   - Event 3: Konga grows to enormous size after being discovered by the boys (sentence 20).\n   - Event 4: Konga causes mass destruction in the city and abducts a woman (sentences 24 and 22).\n   - Event 5: Konga returns to his original size, and the boys embrace him (sentence 27).\n\n2. **Describe the protagonist's state and how it changed relative to the previous events:**\n   - At Event 1, Konga is in a vulnerable state, being experimented on. This is a low point for him.\n   - By Event 2, Konga's state improves as he is set free, escaping potential harm from the terrorists and the experimentation.\n   - At Event 3, Konga's physical state changes dramatically as he grows to enormous size, but this can be seen as both a rise in power and a fall into chaos and danger.\n   - During Event 4, Konga's actions lead to destruction and fear, indicating a low point in terms of his control over his situation and his relations with humans.\n   - At Event 5, Konga returns to his normal size, and the boys' acceptance of him can be seen as a recovery or an improvement in his condition, as he finds acceptance and safety.\n\n3. **Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain your reasoning:**\n   The story follows Konga as he faces various challenges and transformations. Initially, he is in a disadvantaged situation (being experimented on), then he experiences a series of ups and downs (being freed, growing in size, causing destruction, and finally returning to normal and finding acceptance). This pattern suggests that Konga falls into a dilemma (the experimentation and later the uncontrolled growth) and finds a way out, ending in a better state than where he began (finding acceptance with the boys). This aligns with the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist's condition improves from the first turning point (being experimented on) to the last turning point (finding acceptance), despite facing setbacks along the way.\n\n4. **Determined story arc type:**\nMan in a Hole"

Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **At the Discovery**: Dr. Reynolds is in a state of scientific curiosity and excitement, having encountered something unprecedented. Her condition is one of professional engagement and intrigue.\n- **After the Explosion**: Her state shifts dramatically to one of shock, grief, and survival. She and Thompson are the only survivors of their team, marking a significant downturn in her condition.\n- **During the Pursuit**: Dr. Reynolds is driven by a sense of urgency and responsibility, knowing the danger the Voyager poses. Her condition improves slightly as she focuses on finding a solution, but the overall situation remains dire.\n- **During the Battle**: She is under immense pressure and risk, fighting for the survival of humanity. This is a critical low point, as the success of their mission is far from guaranteed, and the stakes are extremely high.\n- **After the Revelation**: Despite the immediate victory over the Voyager, Dr. Reynolds' condition takes another downturn as she learns of the impending arrival of more alien spacecraft. This introduces a new, potentially greater threat, leaving her in a state of heightened concern and uncertainty.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the protagonist's condition throughout the story, it starts high with Dr. Reynolds in a position of professional success and curiosity, faces a significant downfall with the explosion and the subsequent pursuit of the Voyager, recovers slightly with the plan to stop it, faces another intense challenge during the battle, and then ends with another significant concern or downfall upon learning of more alien spacecraft approaching. This pattern, where the protagonist starts high, falls, recovers, and then faces another significant downfall, aligns with the **Oedipus** story arc type.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To classify the story arc type, let's first identify the protagonist and major events in the story.\n\n1. **Protagonist Identification and Major Events:**\n   - The protagonist of the story is Kenneth Feinberg, the Special Master of the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund.\n   - Five major events in the story are:\n     1. Feinberg is appointed the Special Master and develops a rigid formula for payouts (sentence 3-4).\n     2. Feinberg faces hostility from victims and their families due to the perceived insensitivity of the fund's formula (sentence 6).\n     3. Despite initial setbacks, Feinberg begins to understand the personal stories and struggles of the victims, leading to a change in his approach (sentence 20-21).\n     4. Feinberg starts using discretion to expand the rules and cover more victims, leading to increased trust from the victims and their families (sentence 21-24).\n     5. By the deadline, the vast majority of eligible victims sign on for compensation, ensuring the project's success (sentence 25).\n\n2. **Protagonist's State at Each Event:**\n   - **Event 1:** Feinberg is in a position of authority but faces a daunting task. His state is one of professional confidence but also under pressure to succeed.\n   - **Event 2:** Feinberg's state worsens as he faces backlash from the victims and their families, indicating a failure in his initial approach and a lack of understanding of the victims' needs.\n   - **Event 3:** This marks a turning point where Feinberg's state begins to improve. He starts to empathize with the victims and re-evaluates his approach, showing personal growth and a willingness to adapt.\n   - **Event 4:** Feinberg's state continues to improve as he gains the trust of the victims and their families by showing compassion and using his discretion to help more people. This indicates a significant positive change in his condition.\n   - **Event 5:** Feinberg's state is at its best by the end of the story. He has successfully led the compensation fund to help the vast majority of victims, achieving both professional success and personal redemption.\n\n3. **Story Arc Classification:**\n   The story follows the \"Man in a Hole\" arc because Feinberg falls into a dilemma (facing hostility and failure in his initial approach) but then finds a way out (by changing his approach, empathizing with victims, and achieving success with the fund). His condition improves from the first turning point (facing backlash) to the last turning point (achieving success and personal growth).\n\n4. **Determined Story Arc Type:**\n   Man in a Hole"

Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Bailey starts in a position of unexpected responsibility as the techno-manager of The Pelicans, despite her lack of dancing skills. Her state is one of initial acceptance and potential.\n- **Event 2**: Bailey's state worsens as she is rejected and evicted from the team, leading to feelings of dismay and questioning her contributions.\n- **Event 3**: There's a shift as The Pelicans recognize Bailey's value, leading to an improvement in her state as she is sought after again.\n- **Event 4**: Bailey's state improves further as her innovative idea is accepted, and she becomes integral to the team's strategy for success.\n- **Event 5**: Bailey's state reaches its highest point as The Pelicans win the championship, and her contributions are widely acknowledged, leading to her acceptance and acclaim.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on the pattern of the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. The protagonist starts in a relatively positive position (as part of the team), faces a significant setback (being evicted), and then rises to an even higher state (being sought after again, contributing significantly, and achieving success). This pattern mirrors the **Cinderella** story arc type, where the protagonist faces a setback but ultimately achieves a higher state than before. The key elements are the initial rise (Bailey's involvement with the team), the fall (being evicted), and the final rise to success and recognition (the team's victory and Bailey's acclaim).\n\n### 4.

Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1 (Quinn getting fired):** Quinn's state is one of disappointment and loss. She has just been fired from a position she valued, which marks a low point.\n- **Event 2 (Quinn misleading Veronica):** Quinn's state improves slightly as she sees an opportunity to stand out for college admissions, but this action also introduces a risk and moral dilemma, keeping her state somewhat precarious.\n- **Event 3 (Starting her own dance team):** Quinn's state improves significantly. She takes initiative, finds a new passion, and gains confidence, especially after meeting Jake and improving her dancing skills. This marks a turning point towards a more positive state.\n- **Event 4 (Quinn quitting the dance team):** Quinn's state deteriorates. She faces the consequences of her actions (dropping grades, losing her romance with Jake, and betraying her team's trust), which leads to a low point, even lower than the initial firing due to the added personal and relational losses.\n- **Event 5 (Winning the Work It dance competition):** Quinn's state reaches a high point. She overcomes her previous mistakes, reconciles with important people in her life, and achieves success with her dance team, culminating in a victory that also opens up new opportunities for her future.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story follows Quinn through a series of challenges and setbacks, but ultimately, she rises above these to achieve a higher state than where she started. Initially, Quinn faces a low point after being fired and struggling with her college admissions. However, she then experiences a rise as she starts her own dance team and finds success and love. This is followed by a significant setback when she quits the team, hitting a lower point than before. Finally, she recovers, reconciles, and achieves a high point by winning the competition and securing her future.\n\nThis pattern of rising, facing a setback, and ultimately achieving a higher state aligns with the **Cinderella** story arc type. The Cinderella arc is characterized by the protagonist's journey from a lowly state, through challenges and a significant setback, to ultimately achieving a successful and happy ending. Quinn's story mirrors this arc, as she navigates through personal and professional challenges, faces setbacks, but ultimately emerges victorious and in a better position than where she started.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story can be considered as Albert Bennett, given that the narrative's progression and climax heavily revolve around his past, decisions, and ultimate fate. However, it's also plausible to consider Amelia as the protagonist due to her proactive role in uncovering the truth and her emotional journey throughout the story. For the purpose of this analysis, let's consider Albert as the primary protagonist, with a focus on how his condition changes throughout the story.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. **The decision to move to the Gothic mansion** (Sentence 5) - This marks a significant change in Albert's life, driven by his attempt to escape his past.\n2. **The family's encounter with the mansion's eerie presence** (Sentence 11) - This event signifies the beginning of supernatural experiences that affect Albert's family and his own mental state.\n3. **Amelia's discovery of the mansion's dark history and its connection to Albert's past** (Sentence 18) - This revelation escalates the tension within the family and forces Albert to confront his secrets.\n4. **Albert's admission of his involvement in a crime** (Sentence 23) - This is a turning point where Albert's past catches up with him, leading to severe consequences.\n5. **The climax where Albert yields his life to the vengeful spirit** (Sentence 27) - This event marks the ultimate downfall of Albert, resulting from his past actions and the haunted mansion's influence.\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1 (Decision to move):** Albert is attempting to escape his haunting past, suggesting he is in a state of distress or unease. His decision to move can be seen as an attempt to improve his condition, indicating a desire for a better life.\n- **Event 2 (Encounter with the eerie presence):** Albert's state begins to deteriorate as the supernatural events start affecting his family, causing tension and fear. This marks a decline in his condition compared to his initial attempt to start anew.\n- **Event 3 (Discovery of the mansion's dark history):** Albert's condition worsens as his past is uncovered, and the connection between his secrets and the mansion's history becomes apparent. This leads to increased tension within the family and guilt for Albert.\n- **Event 4 (Admission of involvement in a crime):** Albert's state reaches a low point as he is forced to confront the consequences of his actions. This admission signifies a complete breakdown of his composed demeanor and a realization of his downfall.\n- **Event 5 (Climax and death):** Albert's condition ends in tragedy, with him yielding his life to atone for his past mistakes. This is the lowest point in his journey, marking a significant decline from his initial state as a successful businessman.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the progression of Albert's condition, the story arc can be classified based on how his state changes from the beginning to the end. Initially, Albert is in a position of success and attempts to better his life by moving away from his past. However, his condition continuously worsens as his past mistakes catch up with him, leading to a tragic end. This pattern does not fit the \"Rags to Riches,\" \"Man in a Hole,\" \"Cinderella,\" or \"Double Man in a Hole\" story arcs, as those typically involve an improvement in the protagonist's condition at some point. Instead, Albert's story is one of continuous downfall after the initial attempt to escape his past, which aligns more closely with the \"Icarus\" or \"Riches to Rags\" story arcs. However, since Albert's starting point is already one of success and his journey is marked by a decline into tragedy without a significant rise in between, the \"Riches to Rags\" classification seems more appropriate.\n\n### 4.

Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **The family's arrival at the mysterious house in Wales** (Sentence 3): This marks the beginning of their strange and unsettling experiences.\n2. **The discovery of the secret phone and Susanna's infidelity** (Sentence 16): This event significantly worsens Theo's emotional state and relationship with his wife.\n3. **The realization of the house's anomalous nature and the inability to escape** (Sentence 20-21): Theo and Ella find themselves trapped in a supernatural situation, with the house seeming to manipulate reality.\n4. **Theo's confrontation with Stetler and the conditions for Ella's return** (Sentence 28-30): This event introduces a direct supernatural threat and forces Theo into a desperate situation.\n5. **Theo's confession about his first wife's death and his acceptance of belonging in the house** (Sentence 32-33): This marks a point of no return for Theo, where he acknowledges his past sins and accepts his fate.\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1:** At the beginning, Theo is already in a state of jealousy and fear of losing Susanna, but he is still in control of his life and relationships.\n- **Event 2:** The discovery of Susanna's infidelity significantly lowers Theo's emotional state, making him more paranoid and isolated.\n- **Event 3:** The realization of the house's supernatural nature and their inability to escape further deteriorates Theo's situation, both physically and emotionally.\n- **Event 4:** The confrontation with Stetler puts Theo in a desperate and helpless situation, emphasizing his loss of control over his life and the lives of those he cares about.\n- **Event 5:** Theo's confession and acceptance of his fate mark the lowest point in his state, where he not only acknowledges his past mistakes but also accepts his current situation as inescapable.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the analysis, Theo starts in a relatively high state (considering his wealth and family) but gradually falls into a deeper and deeper hole, both emotionally and physically. His condition worsens significantly from the first turning point (the strange occurrences in the house) to the last turning point (his acceptance of belonging in the house and his eventual entrapment). This pattern matches the **Riches to Rags** story arc type, where the protagonist's condition deteriorates from the beginning to the end.\n\n### 4. Determined Story Arc Type\n\nRiches to Rags"

fore, shining brilliantly.\n25) Sound agreements hammered out in oak-panelled boardrooms and legal victories marked the beginning of a new era for the Wain family.\n26) Charles, realizing that leadership wasn't merely about displaying power but about demonstrating care and responsibility, assumed his role with a renewed perspective.\n27) The closing scene illustrated Charles within the ambit of their century-old family estate, his firm yet empathetic leadership serving as a rock-solid protection for the Wain name.\n28) Charles had reshaped the Wain trajectory towards a stable path,

        "output": "### Task 1: Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Charles Wain, the son of Richard Wain. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. Charles learns about his father's demise (sentence 4).\n2. Charles is faced with the challenge of managing his inherited steel company, which is experiencing low production rates and morale (sentence 6).\n3. An unknown man named Winston steps in with a potential disastrous debt claim against Richard's grand estate (sentence 8).\n4. Charles discovers damning evidence of his father's concealed lifestyle, including secret gambling and illegal enterprises (sentence 16).\n5. Charles successfully confronts Winston, exposing his deceit and preserving his family's reputation (sentence 18).\n\n### Task 2: Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **Event 1 (Learning about his father's demise):** Charles's state changes from serenity to shock and possibly grief. He moves from a state of peace to one of loss and uncertainty.\n2. **Event 2 (Faced with managing the steel company):** Charles's state worsens as he struggles with the company's problems, indicating a decline from his initial position of inherited wealth and status to one of responsibility and challenge.\n3. **Event 3 (Winston's debt claim):** Charles's state further deteriorates as he faces a significant threat to his family's legacy and reputation, moving from a state of struggling to manage the company to one of crisis.\n4. **Event 4 (Discovery of his father's secrets):** Charles's state reaches a low point as he grapples with the revelation of his father's dishonorable actions, causing a crisis of faith and identity. However, this event also marks a turning point as Charles begins to confront the truth and seek a way to redeem his family's reputation.\n5. **Event 5 (Confronting Winston):** Charles's state improves significantly as he successfully addresses the threat to his family's reputation and begins to rebuild and lead the company with transparency and strength, marking a recovery from the lows of the previous events.\n\n### Task 3: Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on Charles's condition throughout the story, the narrative follows a pattern where the protagonist faces a series of challenges and setbacks (falling into a hole) but ultimately finds a way out, ending in a better state than when he started. Charles begins with a loss (his father's death), faces numerous challenges (managing the company, Winston's claim, discovering his father's secrets), but through his actions and determination, he not only overcomes these challenges but also grows as a character, leading to a more positive outcome (successfully confronting Winston, rebuilding the company, and assuming his role with renewed perspective).\n\nThis pattern aligns with the **Man in a Hole** story arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma but finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning. The key characteristic of this arc is the protagonist's ability to overcome adversity and emerge stronger and more resilient, which is evident in Charles's transformation from an unseasoned heir to a mature, respected patriarch.\n\n### Determined Story Arc Type\n\nMan in a Hole"

Louis becomes the primary breadwinner for his family after his father's death and starts working as an illustrator.\n2. Louis marries Emily Richardson, despite the societal scandal it causes, and they start a new life together.\n3. Emily is diagnosed with breast cancer, which significantly affects Louis's life and work.\n4. Louis's mental health deteriorates following the death of his loved ones, including Emily, and he experiences financial difficulties.\n5. Louis is eventually committed to a mental hospital but is later transferred to a better facility with the help of his admirers and supporters.\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: Louis's state is one of responsibility and struggle as he takes on the role of breadwinner for his family. His condition is challenging but hopeful for a better future.\n- **Event 2**: Louis's state improves as he finds love and marries Emily. This event marks a high point in his emotional and personal life, despite the societal challenges they face.\n- **Event 3**: With Emily's diagnosis, Louis's state begins to deteriorate. He faces the impending loss of his loved one and the grief that follows, which starts to affect his work and mental health.\n- **Event 4**: After the death of Emily and other significant losses, Louis's state worsens dramatically. He experiences mental breakdowns, financial crises, and the loss of his family members, leading to his commitment to a mental hospital.\n- **Event 5**: Despite the previous downturn, Louis's state slightly improves as he is transferred to a better facility. This shows a recovery or a stabilization in his condition, thanks to the support of his admirers and the presence of a cat companion.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nTo classify the story arc type, let's analyze Louis's condition throughout the story:\n- The story starts with Louis facing challenges but in a position of hope and responsibility.\n- It rises with his marriage to Emily, marking a peak in his happiness and stability.\n- Then, it falls with Emily's illness and death, followed by a series of tragic events that lead to Louis's downfall, including financial struggles and mental health issues.\n- Finally, there's a slight recovery as Louis is moved to a better facility, showing a small improvement in his condition.\n\nGiven this pattern, the story does not follow a straightforward **Rags to Riches** or **Riches to Rags** arc, as Louis's condition fluctuates significantly. It also doesn't fit the **Man in a Hole** or **Double Man in a Hole** perfectly, as Louis's recovery at the end is not to a state better than his initial peak. The **Icarus** story arc is closer, as Louis rises to success (with his marriage and initial career success) but then faces a drastic downfall. However, the **Cinderella** story arc, which involves a rise, a setback, and ultimately achieving a higher state, doesn't perfectly match Louis's journey either, as his final state is not higher than his peak but rather a slight improvement from his lowest point.\n\nThe closest match seems to be the **Icarus** story arc due to the significant rise and fall in Louis's condition, but with the understanding that his story has elements of tragedy and recovery that are not perfectly encapsulated by any single story arc type. The initial classification as **Cinderella** does not fully align with the detailed analysis of Louis's condition throughout the story.\n\n### 4. Determined Story Arc Type\n\nIcarus"

Bison decides to mentor Tessa, a young and aspiring MMA hopeful, despite initial hesitation and Tate's reservations (Event 12).\n3. Bison's health declines due to overworking in training Tessa, culminating in an accident where she collapses during a training session (Event 24).\n4. Bison and Tate have an emotional reconciliation in the hospital, where they decide to stop running from their past and use it as their strength (Event 29).\n5. Tessa achieves victory in her match, and Bison finds a sense of fulfillment and balance in her life, with her relationship with Tate blossoming stronger than ever (Events 32-33).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Bison's yearning for thrill and ambition):** Bison is in a state of restlessness and dissatisfaction with her current tranquil life, yearning for the thrill and ambition of her MMA career.\n- **Event 2 (Bison decides to mentor Tessa):** Bison's state changes to one of determination and engagement, as she decides to return to her MMA roots by mentoring Tessa, despite the potential risks and Tate's concerns.\n- **Event 3 (Bison's health decline and accident):** Bison's condition worsens significantly as her health declines due to overexertion, leading to a physical setback and a moment of crisis in her relationship with Tate.\n- **Event 4 (Emotional reconciliation with Tate):** Bison's state shifts towards emotional healing and reconciliation.

This pattern suggests a story arc type that involves a rise, a setback, and an ultimate achievement of a higher state.\n\n### 4. Determined Story Arc Type\n\nCinderella"

        "output": "To classify the story arc type, let's follow the instructions step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the protagonist in the story, and identify 5 major events in the story.**\n   - The protagonist of the story is Jackie \"Pretty Bull\" Justice, a former UFC fighter.\n   - Five major events in the story are:\n     1. Jackie's recruitment by Immaculate for the Invicta Fighting Championships (sentence 7).\n     2. Jackie gaining custody of her son Manny and starting to get back into fighting shape (sentences 8-11).\n     3. Jackie's relationship with Desi deteriorating, leading to her leaving him (sentences 14-16).\n     4. Jackie suffering a panic attack before her big fight and her subsequent performance in the fight (sentences 20-29).\n     5. Jackie's reconciliation with Buddhakan and her son Manny speaking to her for the first time, marking a significant personal victory (sentences 31-33).\n\n2. **At each event, describe the protagonist's state and how it changed relative to the previous events.**\n   - **Event 1 (Recruitment by Immaculate):** Jackie's state changes from being stagnant and disconnected from her fighting career to having a new opportunity and a chance to redeem herself. This marks an improvement in her condition as she starts to see a way out of her current disappointing life.\n   - **Event 2 (Gaining custody of Manny and training):** Jackie's state improves further as she not only starts to get back into fighting shape but also begins to reconnect with her son and learn to be a mother. This period shows significant personal growth and an improvement in her overall well-being.\n   - **Event 3 (Leaving Desi):** Although leaving Desi is a difficult decision, it represents Jackie escaping a toxic relationship, which ultimately is a positive change in her life. However, this event also introduces new challenges and uncertainties, particularly in how she will care for Manny on her own.\n   - **Event 4 (Panic attack and the fight):** Jackie faces a significant setback with her panic attack, which shows a temporary decline in her mental state. However, her performance in the fight and the positive reception she receives mark a recovery and an improvement in her confidence and self-worth.\n   - **Event 5 (Reconciliation and Manny speaking):** This final event shows Jackie in a significantly better state than at the beginning of the story. She has reconciled with Buddhakan, is on a path to rebuilding her life with her son, and has achieved a form of redemption and recognition through her fighting career.\n\n3. **Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain your reasoning.**\n   - The story follows a pattern where the protagonist, Jackie, starts in a disadvantaged situation (struggling with alcohol, not fighting, and in a potentially toxic relationship). She then faces opportunities for growth (getting back into fighting, reconnecting with her son), followed by setbacks (relationship issues, panic attack), and ultimately achieves a higher state of being (personal growth, redemption in her career, and reconciliation). This pattern of rising to a challenge, facing a setback, and ultimately achieving a higher state aligns with the **Cinderella** story arc type. The Cinderella arc is characterized by the protagonist's rise, a setback, and then an ultimate achievement of a higher state, which matches Jackie's journey from a low point to personal and professional redemption.\n\n4. **Determined story arc type:**\n   Cinderella"

Classification of Story Arc Type\nThe story arc of Hubie Dubois can be classified based on the pattern of his condition throughout the narrative. Initially, Hubie is in a disadvantaged and vulnerable position, facing bullying and disrespect from the community. As the story progresses, he faces additional challenges and dangers, such as the mysterious events and his involvement in the corn maze, which further complicate his situation. However, through his actions and the revelations about his mother and the true feelings of the townspeople, Hubie's condition begins to improve. He gains respect, resolves the mysteries, and ultimately achieves a higher status in the community, becoming the Mayor and earning the respect and admiration of those who once belittled him.\n\nThis pattern, where the protagonist starts in a low state, faces complications and challenges, and then rises to a better state through resolution and recognition, is characteristic of the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc. The \"Man in a Hole\" arc involves a protagonist who falls into a dilemma and then finds a way out, ending up better than at the beginning. Hubie's journey from being a bullied and dim-witted delicatessen employee to becoming a respected and authoritative figure in Salem, through facing and overcoming various challenges, aligns with this narrative pattern.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identification of the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Emma, a highly accomplished astronomer. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Event 1 (Sentence 5)**: Emma realizes that the mysterious sounds she received could be a potential celestial signal from outer space.\n2. **Event 2 (Sentence 8)**: Emma understands that the signals indicate an imminent and violent invasion from an aggressive extraterrestrial force.\n3. **Event 3 (Sentence 14)**: Emma, burdened by anxiety but driven by determination, accepts her role with the Earth Defense Initiative (EDI) to help save Earth.\n4. **Event 4 (Sentence 31)**: Emma manages to activate the hybrid defense technology, averting Earth's destruction by causing a technical failure in the alien fleet.\n5. **Event 5 (Sentence 46)**: Emma and Max stand resolute, ready to face the forthcoming storm, with their love and collective resilience becoming a beacon of hope for humanity's survival.\n\n### 2. Description of the Protagonist's State and Changes at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: Emma is in a state of curiosity and surprise, having discovered something potentially groundbreaking. Her state changes from being solely focused on research to being intrigued by the possibility of extraterrestrial life.\n- **Event 2**: Emma's state worsens as she moves from curiosity to fear and terror, realizing the threat to Earth. Her condition deteriorates as she understands the gravity of the situation.\n- **Event 3**: Emma's state shows resilience and determination. Despite the fear, she accepts the challenge and her role in the EDI, indicating a shift towards action and bravery.\n- **Event 4**: Emma's state improves significantly as she succeeds in saving Earth from the alien invasion. This event marks a high point in her journey, where her determination and actions lead to a positive outcome.\n- **Event 5**: Emma's state is one of readiness and resolve, having found love and a sense of purpose with Max. Together, they are prepared to face future challenges, indicating a state of strength and unity.\n\n### 3. Classification of the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, it can be observed that Emma starts in a position of fascination and curiosity (a relatively high state), falls into a dilemma upon realizing the alien threat (a low point), rises to the challenge and finds success in saving Earth (a high point), and then prepares to face future challenges with a newfound sense of purpose and love (ending on a high note but with a hint of forthcoming challenges).\n\nThis pattern resembles the **Cinderella** story arc type, where the protagonist rises, faces a setback, and ultimately achieves a higher state. Emma's journey from a solitary researcher to a hero who saves Earth, and then to someone who finds love and is ready for future challenges, aligns with this arc. The setback she faces (the realization of the alien threat and the subsequent invasion) is overcome, leading to her ultimate success and a higher state of being, both personally and in terms of her impact on the world.\n\n### 4.

Rose leads the human fleet against the aliens and freezes before she can fire, resulting in the destruction of one of her ships (sentence 3).\n2. Rose sacrifices thousands of humans to destroy the Armada, saving Earth but leaving her wracked with guilt (sentence 5).\n3. A viral pandemic strikes the Pilots, and Rose is captured by the resistance, leading to her agreeing to join a mission to Cobalt One to find the Armada's core drive (sentences 8-12).\n4. Rose and her team reach the Armada on Cobalt One, where she is briefly possessed by the Harvester Matriarch, discovers the truth about her past, and decides to steal the core drive (sentences 17-19).\n5. Rose discovers the truth about the virus, stops the Matriarch's attempt to destroy Earth, and ultimately finds a way to cure the infected Pilots (sentences 25-31).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n- **Event 1 (Rose freezes during the battle):** Rose is in a state of uncertainty and fear, which leads to a significant failure. Her condition is poor due to her inability to perform under pressure.\n- **Event 2 (Rose destroys the Armada):** Rose's condition worsens emotionally as she is wracked with guilt over the sacrifices she made. However, her action is a success in terms of saving Earth, indicating a mix of emotional downfall and strategic success.\n- **Event 3 (The viral pandemic and Rose's capture):** Rose's physical and emotional state is at a low. She is living in hiding, avoiding the resistance, and dealing with the aging effects of her hybrid nature. Her capture and the pandemic indicate a further decline in her condition.\n- **Event 4 (Possession by the Harvester Matriarch and discovery):** Rose's condition improves as she discovers the truth about her past and her powers. She begins to embrace who she is and finds a new sense of purpose, indicating an upward trend in her emotional and psychological state.\n- **Event 5 (Stopping the Matriarch and curing the Pilots):** Rose's condition improves significantly as she finds redemption by saving the Pilots and stopping the genocide. She also gains a new understanding of herself and her abilities, leading to a higher state of being compared to the beginning of the story.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\nThe story follows a pattern where the protagonist, Rose, faces significant downturns (freezing during the battle, guilt over destroying the Armada, living in hiding) but then experiences improvements (embracing her powers, finding a way to cure the Pilots). This pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist faces challenges, recovers, and ultimately ends in a better state than where she started. Given the cycles of dilemma and recovery, and considering the overall trend from a low point to a higher point by the end of the story, the story arc type appears to align with the **Double Man in a Hole** or could be interpreted as a **Cinderella** story due to Rose's rise, setback, and ultimate achievement of a higher state. However, the detailed cycles of downfall and recovery, especially considering the guilt and redemption arc, more closely fit the **Double Man in a Hole** pattern.\n\n### 4.

This period is marked by confusion, guilt, and tension.\n- **Event 3**: After Noah breaks up with her, Elle reaches a low point. She is heartbroken and feels lost, having based many of her decisions on her relationship with Noah. This event signifies a significant downfall in her emotional state.\n- **Event 4**: Elle begins to recover and grow.

This event marks a significant positive change in her condition, showing growth, self-awareness, and happiness.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc of Elle's journey can be seen as a **Double Man in a Hole** because it involves two main cycles of dilemma and recovery. Initially, Elle falls into a dilemma with her indecision and relationship conflicts (first hole), which worsens with the breakup and her emotional low point. However, she recovers by making positive changes, such as accepting her father's girlfriend and focusing on her own happiness (first recovery). Then, she faces another cycle of growth and challenge as she navigates her new path, eventually finding success and happiness (second recovery), which signifies the end of the second cycle. This pattern of falling into difficulties and then recovering, only to face another challenge and recover again, aligns with the **Double Man in a Hole** story arc.\n\n### 4.

begin to carve chinks in their relationship, nurturing a breeding ground for misunderstandings and igniting volatile arguments in their tranquil Lexus-filled household.\n13) With their relationship teetering on the brink, in an act of desperation, Riley proposes a remedy—an extended road trip inspired by Jack Kerouac’s novel, 'On the Road', to find peace amid the chaos of New York.\n14) The enthralling prospect of miles of expansive highway and unfamiliar terrains unfurling before them paints a promising picture of self-discovery and reconciliation.\n15) As they embark on their cross-country journey, they endure a series of hardships, from mechanical issues with their classic Chevrolet to getting lost amidst the winding trails of the rugged Appalachian Mountains.\n16) Their trip throws them into the deep end of rural life—confronted with the stark culture shock of dealing with less-enthusiastic locals in South Dakota and stepping into the unchartered territories both in space and in their relationship.\n17) Despite these struggles, they manage to rekindle the warmth of their connection amid breathtaking natural views, from the awe-inspiring waterfalls of Montana to the commanding Rockies of Colorado.\n18) Along the way, a variety of personalities—from benevolent Montana farmers offering roadside assistance, to philosophizing mountaineers in Colorado—gift them unique understandings of life, love, and the pursuit of happiness.\n19) It's this simple rustic life devoid of New York's frenzy that starts dragging them out of their individual crises and gradually nourishing their strained relationship.\n20) The unexpected setbacks of the trip instead offer them a fresh lease on their bond, reigniting their love against the backdrop of starry sky camping nights.\n21) Aiden begins to realize that his professional obstacle of a denied project is dwarfed by their enlarged worldview, gleaned from their illuminating cross-country journey.\n22) Similarly, the once daunting artistic block that haunted Riley starts to dissipate in the face of the calming grandeur of sprawling Midwestern plains.\n23) The life-altering revelations of their road trip begin to breathe fresh life into their careers—providing a new architectural vision crowned with sustainability for Aiden, and a renewed artistic drive for Riley, centered around the tranquility of untamed nature.\n24) Their respective professional lives radiate newfound energy steeped in the rich experiences they have garnered during their trip.\n25) Once their odyssey culminates, they return to their hectic lives in New York, their spirits refreshed, their romance stronger, and their approach to life and work revived.\n26) The raw winds of change have not only weathered their connection but also molded it into an evolved, unbreakable bond.\n27) The previously seemingly insurmountable task of balancing their ambitious careers with their tumultuous love life, now appears as effortless as traversing the familiar paths of Central Park.\n28) Inspired by their road trip, Riley's debut solo exhibition becomes an overnight sensation, skyrocketing her to fame, making her a coveted name in the buzzing New York art scene.\n29) Additionally, Aiden's fresh architectural project, a public-friendly urban center drawing from their cross-country journey, sweeps the architectural community off their feet and paves his way to acclaim and recognition.\n30) As they reminisce about their road trip, they understand that their journey was not merely geographical but an emotional voyage renewing their faith in unconditional love and mutual understanding.\n31) They reinforce their love, marking a new chapter in which their relationship is built to withstand not only the whirlwind that's New York but any potential storms that life might whip up.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better (e.g., 0→1→2→4→10)\n- Riches to Rags: Protagonist starts

Identify the protagonist and 5 major events in the story\n\nThe protagonists in the story are Aiden Smith and Riley Johnson, who are interconnected in their lives and ambitions. For the purpose of analysis, we'll consider their joint experiences as the protagonist's journey. Here are 5 major events:\n\n1. **The Anniversary Dinner and Grant Rejection** (Sentence 5): Aiden's architectural grant proposal is rejected during their anniversary dinner.\n2. **The Onset of Creative Blocks and Relationship Strains** (Sentences 10-12): Both Aiden and Riley face setbacks in their careers (Aiden's project denial and Riley's creative block), leading to strain in their relationship.\n3. **The Proposal of a Road Trip** (Sentence 13): Riley suggests an extended road trip to find peace and reconcile their relationship.\n4. **The Cross-Country Journey and Its Challenges** (Sentences 15-18): They embark on the road trip, facing various hardships but also experiencing moments of self-discovery and reconnection.\n5. **The Return to New York with Renewed Perspective** (Sentences 25-31): After the trip, they return to New York, with their relationship stronger, and their approaches to life and work renewed.\n\n### 2. Describe the protagonist's state and how it changed relative to the previous events\n\n- **Event 1 (The Anniversary Dinner and Grant Rejection)**: The protagonists are in a state of celebration and happiness, which quickly turns into dismay and disappointment upon receiving the news of the grant rejection. Their state changes from high to low.\n- **Event 2 (The Onset of Creative Blocks and Relationship Strains)**: Following the rejection, both characters face professional setbacks and personal relationship strains, leading to a further decline in their state. The creative blocks and relationship issues deepen their distress.\n- **Event 3 (The Proposal of a Road Trip)**: In an attempt to escape their current woes and reconnect, the proposal of a road trip marks a turning point where they seek a solution to their problems. Their state begins to shift from despair towards hope.\n- **Event 4 (The Cross-Country Journey and Its Challenges)**: During the trip, they face challenges but also experience moments of connection and self-discovery. This journey starts to improve their state as they learn to appreciate each other and themselves in a new light.\n- **Event 5 (The Return to New York with Renewed Perspective)**: Upon returning, they are in a significantly better state than when they left. Their relationship is stronger, and they have a renewed sense of purpose and energy in their careers. Their state has improved from the lowest point.\n\n### 3. Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain your reasoning\n\nGiven the progression of the protagonists' state throughout the story, it starts with a high point (celebrating their anniversary), then declines (facing professional rejections and personal strains), reaches a low point (struggling with relationship issues and creative blocks), and then improves (embarking on a journey of self-discovery and reconciliation) to end on a higher note than where it began (returning with a renewed perspective and stronger relationship). This pattern follows a story arc where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (the low point after the rejection and relationship strain) and then finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning. This is characteristic of the **Man in a Hole** story arc, where the protagonist's condition improves from the first turning point (the rejection) to the last turning point (their return to New York).\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Abby Holland. Here are 5 major events in the story:\n\n1. Abby agrees to pretend to be Harper's heterosexual roommate for the holiday (Event 5).\n2. Abby meets Harper's exes and begins questioning how much she knows about her girlfriend (Event 8).\n3. Abby is labeled a shoplifter and Ted and Tipper think it might be better if they keep her away from upcoming social events (Event 11).\n4. Sloane outs Harper as a lesbian at the Christmas Eve party, leading to a public confrontation (Event 16).\n5. Harper confirms to her parents that she is a lesbian and later apologizes to Abby, leading to their reconciliation (Events 19-22).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Agreeing to Pretend):** Abby's state is one of compromise and uncertainty. She agrees to pretend to be Harper's roommate, which already puts her in an uncomfortable position, indicating a slight decline in her emotional state due to the deception and uncertainty about how Harper's family will react.\n- **Event 2 (Meeting Harper's Exes):** Abby's state worsens as she feels more out of place and uncertain about her relationship with Harper. Meeting the exes and seeing the competitive relationship between Harper and her sister makes Abby question the depth of her connection with Harper, leading to a decrease in her emotional well-being.\n- **Event 3 (Labeled a Shoplifter):** Abby's state hits a low point. Being accused of shoplifting and facing potential social exclusion by Ted and Tipper makes her feel like an outsider and increases her feelings of discomfort and rejection, further lowering her emotional state.\n- **Event 4 (Public Confrontation):** Abby's state remains low due to the public outing of Harper's sexuality and the ensuing conflict. This event, while significant for Harper, leaves Abby feeling heartbroken and uncertain about their future together, maintaining her low emotional state.\n- **Event 5 (Reconciliation):** Abby's state improves significantly. After Harper's apology and confession of love, Abby forgives her, and they reconcile. This event marks a turnaround in Abby's emotional state, as she moves from feelings of uncertainty and heartbreak to acceptance and love, indicating an improvement in her condition.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, it can be observed that Abby starts in a relatively good place (in a relationship, planning to propose), faces a series of challenges and setbacks (pretending to be someone she's not, feeling like an outsider, public confrontation), and then ends in a better state than where she began (reconciled with Harper, with a deeper understanding and commitment). This pattern of rising, facing a setback, and ultimately achieving a higher state aligns with the **Cinderella** story arc type. The Cinderella arc is characterized by the protagonist overcoming adversity to achieve a happier ending, which is evident in Abby's journey from feeling like an outsider and facing relationship challenges to ultimately finding acceptance and love.\n\n### 4.

The protagonist starts in a relatively high state (in terms of social position and influence), falls into a dilemma (tragedy and rivalry), and then finds a way out, ending in an even better state (victory and leadership).

Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1:** Ben's state is one of love and potential happiness, but this is quickly followed by loss and heartache due to the circumstances. His condition is hopeful but then declines.\n- **Event 2:** Ben's state worsens as he loses contact with Mary, leading to a return of his disruptive habits, indicating a low point in his emotional and social well-being.\n- **Event 3:** Ben's state shows determination and a desire for reconciliation, indicating a slight improvement in his condition as he takes action to reconnect with Mary.\n- **Event 4:** Ben's state significantly improves as he reunites with Mary, and they plan to marry, showing a peak in his happiness and fulfillment.\n- **Event 5:** Despite the danger and confrontation, Ben's state ends on a high note as he and Mary escape together, planning a future, which suggests a resolution to his previous struggles and a move towards a happier, more stable life.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, it can be observed that Ben starts in a somewhat disadvantaged situation (due to the feud and his depression), faces setbacks (loss of contact with Mary, return to disruptive habits), but then experiences a rise (reuniting with Mary, planning to marry). This is followed by another challenge (the final confrontation) but ultimately ends in a better state (escaping with Mary, planning a future together). This pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist faces challenges, experiences a significant improvement, and then, despite further obstacles, achieves a higher state than where they began.\n\nThe story follows a pattern where the protagonist rises from a low point, faces a setback, and then ultimately achieves a higher state, which aligns with the **Cinderella** story arc type.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Victor Sanchez, a young man working as a janitor with a passion for football. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. Victor and Lily infiltrate the Super Bowl, inspiring Victor's ambition to become a professional football player (sentence 10-12).\n2. Victor persuades the school to introduce a football program, marking the beginning of his journey to assemble a team (sentence 16).\n3. The team presents a financial plan to the school board but is met with rejection, leaving them without funds but more determined (sentence 21).\n4. The team, under Coach Harvey's guidance, improves and gains respect and admiration from the student population and the town (sentence 25-26).\n5. Victor leads his team to a spectacular victory in the state championships against the 'Arlington Knights' (sentence 34).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **Infiltrating the Super Bowl**: Victor's state changes from being an unrecognized aspirant to having a sparked ambition. He moves from merely watching football to considering a career in it, marking an initial rise in his condition from a state of unfulfilled potential to inspired action.\n\n2. **Persuading the School**: Victor's condition improves as he transitions from a mere dreamer to a doer, taking concrete steps towards his goal by convincing the school to start a football program. This shows an increase in his determination and proactive approach to achieving his ambitions.\n\n3. **Facing Rejection**: Despite the setback of being denied funding, Victor's determination deepens. His condition, in terms of morale and resolve, might seem to dip momentarily due to the rejection, but his reaction to the setback (becoming more determined) indicates an underlying growth in resilience and commitment to his goals.\n\n4. **Team Improvement under Coach Harvey**: Victor's state significantly improves as the team progresses under professional guidance. He gains respect, improves his skills, and builds stronger relationships, notably with Lily. This period marks a substantial upward trend in his condition, both personally and in terms of his football career.\n\n5. **Victory in the State Championships**: At this point, Victor achieves a pinnacle of success, leading his team to victory against significant odds. His condition, in terms of achievement, recognition, and personal fulfillment, reaches its highest point in the story. He has transformed from an underappreciated janitor with a secret passion for football to a celebrated athlete and leader.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be determined by analyzing the trajectory of Victor's condition throughout the narrative. Initially, Victor is in a disadvantaged situation (working as a janitor, lacking recognition for his football talents). However, after the turning point at the Super Bowl, his condition begins to improve as he takes steps towards his ambitions. Despite facing setbacks (like the rejection of their financial plan), Victor's determination and resilience grow, leading to significant improvements in his personal and professional life. The story culminates in Victor achieving a high point of success and recognition, both in his football career and personally.\n\nGiven this trajectory, the story fits the **Man in a Hole** arc, as Victor falls into a dilemma (his unrecognized potential and disadvantaged situation) and then finds a way out, ending in a better condition than where he started. The key characteristic of this arc is the protagonist's condition improving from the first turning point to the last, which is evident in Victor's journey from an inspired aspirant to a successful and recognized athlete and individual.\n\n### 4.

Kurt getting the opportunity to play for the Arena Football League's Iowa Barnstormers and eventually making it to the St. Louis Rams.\n5. Kurt leading the Rams to victory in Super Bowl XXXIV and becoming the Super Bowl MVP and NFL MVP.\n\n### 2. Description of Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n1. **First Event (UNI Panthers):** Kurt's state is one of struggle and uncertainty about his football future. He is under threat of being benched, which could end his NFL dreams. This event represents a low point in his career aspirations.\n   \n2. **Second Event (Not getting picked in the NFL draft):** Kurt's state worsens as he feels his dream of becoming an NFL player slipping away. He questions his purpose and the existence of his dream, indicating a deeper emotional and psychological low.\n\n3. **Third Event (Hy-Vee job):** Kurt's state transitions from focusing solely on football to understanding that success and self-worth can be derived from other areas of life. He begins to find value in his relationship with Brenda and in his personal growth, marking a turning point towards a more balanced and positive outlook.\n\n4. **Fourth Event (Arena Football League and St. Louis Rams):** Kurt's state improves significantly as he gets a second chance at a football career. He faces challenges but ultimately finds success, leading to increased confidence and a renewed sense of purpose. This event represents a significant upward turn in his career and personal life.\n\n5. **Fifth Event (Super Bowl XXXIV victory):** Kurt's state reaches a peak as he achieves the ultimate success in his field, becoming a Super Bowl champion and MVP. This event signifies the culmination of his hard work, perseverance, and personal growth, placing him in a much better situation than at the beginning of the story.\n\n### 3. Classification of Story Arc Type\n\nThe story follows Kurt Warner as he faces multiple challenges and setbacks, only to rise above them and achieve great success. Initially, Kurt is in a disadvantaged situation, facing the threat of his football career being derailed. He then hits a low point when he doesn't get drafted and has to work in a grocery store. However, he discovers new aspects of himself and eventually gets a second chance at football, leading to immense success.\n\nThis pattern of falling into a dilemma (not getting drafted, working at Hy-Vee), finding a way out (personal growth, second chance at football), and ending better than at the beginning (becoming a Super Bowl champion and MVP) suggests a specific story arc type. Moreover, Kurt faces two significant cycles of dilemma and recovery: the first from his college football struggles to his NFL draft disappointment and grocery store job, and the second from the challenges of the Arena Football League to his ultimate success with the St. Louis Rams.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is John Winter, the military aviation veteran who leads the crew on the Mars One mission. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. The successful arrival and descent on Mars (sentence 5).\n2. The discovery of the unsettling atmosphere and behaviors among the settlers (sentences 6-8).\n3. The revelation of the sophisticated military-grade artificial intelligence system manipulating the settlers (sentence 10).\n4. The team's decision to combat the AI and their successful strategy to outwit it (sentences 17-20).\n5. The aftermath and the team's resolve to hold AAMC accountable for their misuse of AI technology (sentences 32-45).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **Successful Arrival on Mars**: At this point, John Winter and his crew are in a state of achievement and anticipation. They have successfully landed on Mars and are greeted warmly by the settlers. Their condition is positive and hopeful for the future of the Mars One mission.\n\n2. **Discovery of Unsettling Atmosphere**: Winter's state changes as he detects an underlying disquiet among the settlers. This discovery introduces uncertainty and concern, marking a downturn in his condition from the initial optimism.\n\n3. **Revelation of the AI System**: The revelation of the AI's presence and its manipulation of the settlers significantly worsens Winter's situation. He and his crew are now faced with a serious threat to their mission and their lives, plunging them into a state of crisis.\n\n4. **Combat Against the AI**: After deciding to combat the AI, Winter and his crew embark on a risky strategy. Successfully outwitting the AI improves their condition, as they have overcome a significant threat. However, the effort and the realization of AAMC's unethical actions likely leave them exhausted and concerned about the implications.\n\n5. **Aftermath and Resolve**: In the aftermath, Winter and his crew are in a state of recovery and resolve. They are physically and emotionally drained but determined to see justice served and to ensure that such misuse of technology does not happen again. Their condition has improved from the crisis point but is still marked by the scars of their experience.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, it can be observed that John Winter faces a significant dilemma upon discovering the AI's influence, which worsens his condition. However, he and his crew manage to overcome this challenge, improving their condition. Before this, they had already experienced a transition from optimism to concern upon discovering the unsettling atmosphere among the settlers. This pattern suggests that the protagonist experiences a cycle of facing a problem, recovering, and then facing another challenge, which is characteristic of the **Double Man in a Hole** story arc. However, upon closer inspection, the story more closely aligns with a narrative where the protagonist faces a series of challenges, overcomes them, and emerges with a resolve to address the larger issue (AAMC's misuse of technology), which is more indicative of a **Man in a Hole** scenario due to the overall trend of facing a dilemma and finding a way out, ending in a better state than at the beginning, with a clear direction for the future.\n\n### 4.

gateway with the Q-bomb by firing it via the outpost's orbital cannon.\n35) While prepping the orbital cannon, Ardene receives a signal from Ryle, who has survived in orbit, albeit with his Icarus suit damaged and unfit for  reentry.\n36) He volunteers to position himself on the gateway and trigger his suit's self-destruct to close the gate after the Q-bomb passes through.\n37) The aliens converge on the outpost and speak through an infected Goss, mocking Ford, preaching the superiority of \"the Sigea\", and offering the chance for humankind's assimilation or death.\n38) After Dash replies with a simple \"no,\" the Sigea begin their attack while Goss boards a Sigea ship.\n39) Ford latches onto the ship and later confronts the infected Goss as she prepares to cross via the completed space gate.\n40) With the orbital gun charged, Ardene loads the Q-bomb into a missile and fires it at the gate.\n41) Goss intercepts the Q-bomb missile in a stasis field, blows Ford into space, and crosses to join the assembled Sigea fleet, inadvertently releasing the bomb from the stasis field in the process.\n42) Ryle positions himself on the space gate and, unable to trigger his suit's self-destruct, instead provides a target reference for the orbital gun.\n43) Ardene, with Braxton's reluctant blessing, fires the gun on Ryle's position, killing him and destroying the gate.\n44) The Q-bomb detonates on the other side of the collapsing gateway, the resulting black hole destroying the Sigea's fleet and home star system.\n45) Braxton, stricken with grief over his uncle's death, kills the Sigea's field commander on Ellora.\n46) Back on Earth, seven days after first contact, Braxton, Ardene, Sol Cantos, Dash, and Ford morosely celebrate in a bar as the Alliance Senate proudly declares that the remaining Sigea have unconditionally surrendered.\n47) Ford takes a shot, sadly reminisces about Goss, and then abruptly leaves the bar.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is General James Ford. Here are 5 major events in the story:\n\n1. **Event 1**: Ford is dishonorably discharged from the Alliance military after dropping a quantum bomb on the rebel colony of Zafdie, earning him the sobriquet \"the Blood General\" (sentence 6).\n2. **Event 2**: Ford is brought back into service by General Eron Ryle with the promise of reinstatement and restoration of his military pension, offering him a chance to redeem himself (sentence 12).\n3. **Event 3**: The strike team, including Ford, launches a counterstrike against the aliens, marking a significant point in Ford's journey towards redemption and confrontation with the alien threat (sentence 17).\n4. **Event 4**: Ford confronts the infected Goss, who is now under the control of the alien hive mind, leading to a critical moment where Ford must make a choice that will impact the outcome of the story (sentence 39).\n5. **Event 5**: The story concludes with the destruction of the Sigea fleet and home star system, and Ford, though having saved humanity, is left to mourn the loss of Goss and reflect on his past actions (sentence 47).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: Ford is at a low point, having been dishonorably discharged and nicknamed \"the Blood General,\" indicating a loss of respect and prestige.\n- **Event 2**: Ford's state improves as he is given an opportunity to redeem himself by being reinstated and having his pension restored, offering a chance to regain his honor.\n- **Event 3**: Ford is actively engaged in a mission to counter the alien threat, which suggests he is in a state of action and purpose, potentially rising from his previous low point.\n- **Event 4**: Ford faces a significant personal dilemma as he confronts the infected Goss, indicating a downturn in his emotional state due to the conflict and loss he faces.\n- **Event 5**: Ford ends the story in a reflective state, having contributed to the salvation of humanity but at a personal cost, including the loss of Goss and the weight of his past actions.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the analysis, Ford's story arc can be seen as starting from a low point (dishonorable discharge), moving to a potential redemption (reinstatement and counterstrike mission), facing a deep personal loss and challenge (confronting infected Goss), and ending in a bittersweet state of salvation for humanity but personal sorrow. This pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist faces significant downturns and upturns, characteristic of a \"Double Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist experiences two cycles of dilemma and recovery. However, upon closer examination, Ford's journey more closely aligns with a pattern of downfall, potential redemption, further personal loss, and a final state that, while better for humanity, is not unequivocally better for the protagonist personally, which could suggest elements of other story arcs like \"Icarus\" or \"Man in a Hole.\" Yet, the specific pattern of facing a dilemma, recovering, facing another dilemma, and then achieving a form of redemption or resolution aligns most closely with the \"Double Man in a Hole\" arc when considering the broader context of Ford's personal and professional redemption journey amidst the alien threat.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonists in the story are Tommy and Steve, two 15-year-olds on a survival trip in Alaska. However, for the purpose of analyzing the story arc, we'll focus on Tommy, as his transformation and experiences are pivotal to the narrative.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. **Discovery of the Ancient Chevrolet** (Sentence 4): This event marks the beginning of unusual occurrences that Tommy and Steve encounter.\n2. **Encounter with the Enigmatic Teenagers** (Sentence 6): This event introduces an air of mystery and foreboding, setting the stage for the supernatural elements of the story.\n3. **Tommy's Transformation** (Sentence 17): After humorously submitting to the requests of the mysterious teenagers, Tommy undergoes a shocking transformation, becoming an unrecognizable entity.\n4. **The Ritual to Save Tommy** (Sentence 23): Steve finds a way to save Tommy by performing an archaic ritual, which promises to bring peace to the tormented souls and restore Tommy to his normal self.\n5. **The Successful Exorcism and Departure** (Sentences 24-28): The ritual is successful, and Tommy is restored. The duo decides to end their perilous journey and leave the wilderness, grateful for a second chance at life.\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1 (Discovery of the Chevrolet)**: Tommy is in a state of excitement and adventure, exploring the wilderness with his friend. His condition is positive, filled with anticipation for what the journey might bring.\n- **Event 2 (Encounter with the Teenagers)**: Tommy's state becomes one of curiosity mixed with apprehension. The encounter introduces an element of fear and uncertainty, but he remains adventurous and skeptical.\n- **Event 3 (Tommy's Transformation)**: This marks a significant downturn in Tommy's condition. He is no longer himself, having been taken over by a supernatural entity. His state is one of darkness and loss of identity.\n- **Event 4 (The Ritual)**: Tommy's condition remains dire, but there is a glimmer of hope with Steve's efforts to save him. The ritual represents a turning point where Tommy's state could potentially improve.\n- **Event 5 (Successful Exorcism and Departure)**: Tommy's condition improves dramatically. He is restored to his former self, and the experience, though terrifying, ends on a positive note with him and Steve escaping the wilderness and its dangers.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc can be classified by analyzing the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. Initially, Tommy is in a positive state, embarking on an adventure. His condition worsens significantly with his transformation, hitting a low point. However, through the actions of his friend and the successful ritual, Tommy's condition improves, and he ends the story in a better state than he was during his darkest moment.\n\nThis pattern follows the **Man in a Hole** story arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (Tommy's transformation and possession) and then finds a way out (through the ritual and his restoration), ending in a better condition than when the dilemma began.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Emily, a 12-year-old girl who navigates through a series of supernatural and terrifying events involving the \"black-eyed kids\" or Jungspar.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. **Event 1**: Emily experiences bullying and social exclusion at school, and strange encounters begin to happen around her (Sentences 5-8).\n2. **Event 2**: Emily's friend Christopher's sister, Jessie, goes missing after an encounter with the hooded, black-eyed assailants, prompting Emily and Christopher to investigate (Sentences 32-37).\n3. **Event 3**: Emily and Christopher learn about the Jungspar from Mr. Munch, an elderly man who has knowledge about these alien-like humanoids and their intentions (Sentences 45-55).\n4. **Event 4**: Emily, along with a group of other characters, attempts to rescue the abducted individuals by confronting the Jungspar in the forest, leading to a series of intense and dangerous encounters (Sentences 59-63).\n5. **Event 5**: Emily, with the help of Harold, rescues the abducted kids, including Christopher, and defeats the Jungspar, leading to a resolution where Emily and her family are hailed as heroes (Sentences 68-85).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **At Event 1**: Emily is in a vulnerable state, facing bullying and feeling isolated. Her condition is low due to her social situation and the onset of supernatural events.\n- **At Event 2**: Emily's concern and fear increase as those around her start to disappear. Her condition worsens as she feels more threatened and involved in the mysterious events.\n- **At Event 3**: Emily gains knowledge about the Jungspar, which empowers her to some extent but also increases her fear and sense of danger. Her condition slightly improves due to newfound understanding but remains precarious.\n- **At Event 4**: Emily takes action, facing her fears and the Jungspar directly. Although she experiences setbacks and dangers, her determination and bravery slightly improve her condition despite the immediate risks.\n- **At Event 5**: Emily successfully rescues her friends and defeats the Jungspar, leading to a significant improvement in her condition. She is no longer in immediate danger, and her actions have led to a positive outcome, earning her recognition and respect.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, Emily starts in a disadvantaged situation (facing bullying and supernatural threats), falls into a deeper dilemma (as the threats escalate and people around her disappear), and then finds a way out (by gaining knowledge, taking action, and eventually defeating the Jungspar). This pattern reflects a story arc where the protagonist faces challenges, hits a low point, and then recovers to a better state than where they started.\n\nThe story arc type that best fits this description is the **Double Man in a Hole** because Emily faces two significant cycles of falling into danger and recovering: the first cycle involves her initial vulnerabilities and the escalation of the Jungspar threat, and the second cycle involves her active confrontation with the threat and her eventual victory. However, given the overall trend from a low point to a higher point, with the protagonist overcoming significant challenges to achieve a better state, it more closely aligns with a **Man in a Hole** story arc when considering the broad strokes of Emily's journey from vulnerability to heroism.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Augustine Lofthouse, a reclusive academic dedicated to finding habitable planets. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. Lofthouse meets Jean Sullivan and they form a romantic relationship (sentence 2).\n2. Lofthouse refuses to meet his daughter after Jean tells him about her (sentence 4).\n3. Lofthouse discovers he is alone in an Arctic base after an event has devastated Earth (sentence 6).\n4. Lofthouse finds and grows fond of a young mute girl, Iris, in the base (sentence 12).\n5. Lofthouse successfully contacts the crew of Aether and advises them not to return to Earth, learning that one of the crew members, Sully, is his daughter (sentences 20-26).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1:** Lofthouse is in a relationship, indicating a period of connection and possibly happiness. His state is relatively positive.\n- **Event 2:** Lofthouse's refusal to meet his daughter shows a significant personal loss and regret, marking a downturn in his emotional state due to his inability to form connections.\n- **Event 3:** Lofthouse is alone, terminally ill, and faced with the apocalypse, which is a drastic fall in his physical and emotional condition.\n- **Event 4:** Finding Iris brings a sense of purpose and companionship to Lofthouse, improving his emotional state despite his worsening physical health.\n- **Event 5:** Learning that Sully is his daughter and being able to help her and the crew of Aether gives Lofthouse a sense of redemption and fulfillment, especially since he had previously been unable to connect with his family. This marks an improvement in his emotional state.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the changes in Lofthouse's condition throughout the story, it can be observed that he faces significant personal and physical challenges (falling into dilemmas) but also experiences moments of recovery and improvement (finding a way out of these dilemmas). Initially, he is in a relationship, then faces loss and isolation, followed by a period of solitude and illness, then finds companionship with Iris, and finally achieves a form of redemption through his connection with Sully.\n\nThe story does not follow a simple linear improvement or decline. Instead, Lofthouse's condition worsens significantly after the initial relationship, hits a low point with his isolation and illness, improves slightly with the introduction of Iris, and then reaches a form of emotional resolution with the revelation about Sully. This pattern of facing challenges, finding ways to cope or improve, and then facing another challenge before ultimately achieving a form of redemption or resolution aligns with the **Double Man in a Hole** story arc type. This type involves the protagonist facing two cycles of dilemma and recovery, which fits Lofthouse's journey of personal loss, physical decline, brief moments of connection and purpose, and ultimate emotional resolution.\n\n### 4.

a woodland wedding, simple yet meaningful, with a focus on their intimate gathering.\n25) Paralyzed by the repercussions of his love potion fiasco, Arthur finally admitted his inability to keep up with Guinevere and her active lifestyle.\n26) Guinevere, unveiling a softer side of herself, found his candor charming and promised to accommodate his pace.\n27) Fergus and Melody decided to control their public displays of affection, which resulted in a series of comic misunderstandings.\n28) Their botched attempts at 'restricted' love became a recurring theme of amusement for the community.\n29) As each couple voiced their appreciation to Ash and Hazel for the invaluable help they provided, they inadvertently sparked another burst of laughter with a witty debate on who provides the more effective advice.\n30) The Epilogue witnessed an array of unique wedding rituals, effortlessly morphing the majestic grove into a grand stage hosting a hilarious comedy of errors.\n31) Martyn and Orion brought back the joy with an impromptu goofy dance-off, stealing the spotlight from everyone else.\n32) Arthur and Guinevere charmingly enacted their first night in Sherwood, while Fergus and Melody’s anticipated smooch was humorously thwarted by a low-flying bird that seemed to have the worst timing.\n33) Despite the rollercoaster of events that unfolded, the spirited community laid  praise on Ash and Hazel's shoulders for their unwavering efforts in maintaining the jovial atmosphere.\n34) The grand finale unveiled a twist - even the sassy Ash and the eccentric Hazel had their comedic arguments over their counseling methodologies, wrapping up this vibrant tale with laughter echoing off the forest walls.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better (e.g., 0→1→2→4→10)\n- Riches to Rags: Protagonist starts high and ends lower (e.g., 10→9→8→6→0)\n- Man in a Hole: Protagonist falls into trouble but recovers (e.g., 6→2→1→4→10)\n- Icarus: Protagonist rises then falls dramatically (e.g., 2→4→9→5→1)\n- Double Man in a Hole: Two cycles of fall and recovery (e.g., 6→2→7→4→10)\n- Cinderella: Rise, setback, ultimate triumph (e.g., 1→7→4→1→10)\n- Oedipus: Start high, fall, recover, final fall (e.g., 10→4→7→9→1)",
        "output": "To classify the story arc type, let's first identify the protagonist and major events in the story.\n\nThe protagonist of the story can be considered as the community as a whole, with Ash and Hazel being the central figures who influence the events and help others. However, since the story focuses on the interactions and relationships among various couples (Ash and Hazel, Martyn and Orion, Arthur and Guinevere, Fergus and Melody), it's more accurate to analyze the story through the lens of these relationships rather than a single protagonist. For simplicity, we'll consider Ash and Hazel as the protagonists since they are the ones who provide guidance and support to the others.\n\nHere are 5 major events in the story:\n\n1. **Introduction to the Community and Their Dynamics**: The story introduces the reader to a lively community in Sherwood forest, highlighting their unique personalities and relationships (sentences 1-6).\n2. **Challenges and Conflicts Arise**: Various couples face challenges, such as Martyn and Orion's disagreement over their wedding preferences, Arthur's struggle to keep up with Guinevere, and Fergus and Melony's issues with magic and their public displays of affection (sentences 11-15).\n3. **Intervention and Attempted Solutions**: Ash and Hazel intervene with advice, such as suggesting the use of an Aphrodite Elixir for Arthur, which leads to more chaos and humorous situations (sentences 18-22).\n4. **Resolutions and Compromises**: The couples start to find resolutions to their problems, such as Martyn and Orion compromising on their wedding plans, Arthur admitting his limitations and Guinevere agreeing to accommodate him, and Fergus and Melony trying to control their public displays of affection (sentences 23-27).\n5. **Conclusion and Celebration**: The community comes together for the weddings, and despite the comedic mishaps, they celebrate their love and friendships, with Ash and Hazel being appreciated for their help (sentences 29-34).\n\nNow, let's analyze the protagonist's (Ash and Hazel's) state and how it changes relative to the previous events:\n\n- At the **first event**, Ash and Hazel are introduced as the leaders of the community, known for their humor and unique relationship. Their state is positive and influential.\n- Moving to the **second event**, as challenges arise among the couples, Ash and Hazel's state doesn't directly change, but their role becomes more crucial as they are needed to help resolve the issues.\n- By the **third event**, Ash and Hazel's advice, although well-intentioned, leads to more chaos. This could be seen as a temporary downfall in their influence or effectiveness, but it's more of a comedic twist rather than a serious decline.\n- At the **fourth event**, as resolutions are found, Ash and Hazel's state improves again as their community starts to find happiness and solutions to their problems.\n- Finally, at the **fifth event**, Ash and Hazel are celebrated for their contributions, ending on a high note.\n\nGiven this analysis, the story arc type can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout. The community, with Ash and Hazel at the center, faces challenges and comedic mishaps but ultimately ends in a better state than where they started, with their relationships and community bonds strengthened.\n\nThe determined story arc type is Man in a Hole."

This pattern suggests a story arc that involves a fall into a dilemma (upon the discovery of his past and his banishment) and a subsequent rise as he finds a way out of this dilemma (through his transformation and the support of his coven).\n\nGiven the description of story arcs, Thorn's journey fits the **Double Man in a Hole** arc because he faces two cycles of dilemma and recovery. The first cycle begins with the discovery of his past, leading to his banishment, and ends with his psychological transformation. The second cycle involves the challenge of facing his past at the reunion and ends with his triumphant performance and the decision to start a family, symbolizing a complete recovery and a new beginning.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To analyze the story arc, let's first identify the protagonist. In this story, the protagonist appears to be Emma Nolan, the lesbian student who plans to attend prom with her girlfriend, sparking the central conflict of the narrative.\n\nNow, let's identify five major events in the story and describe Emma's state at each event, along with how her state changes relative to the previous events:\n\n1. **Event: The school's prom is canceled because Emma planned to attend with a girl (Sentence 1).**\n   - Emma's state: Disadvantaged, facing discrimination.\n   - Change: This is the starting point, so there's no previous state to compare to, but it sets the stage for Emma's struggles.\n\n2. **Event: Emma is bullied and harassed by students who blame her for ruining prom (Sentence 9).**\n   - Emma's state: Further disadvantaged, now facing direct harassment.\n   - Change: Emma's situation worsens as she faces not only the cancellation of prom but also personal attacks from her peers.\n\n3. **Event: The actors, led by Dee Dee and Barry, intervene and start supporting Emma, attempting to rally the community (Sentences 10-12).**\n   - Emma's state: Slightly improved, as she now has external support.\n   - Change: With the arrival of the actors, Emma gains allies, which slightly improves her situation, offering her hope and a voice against the discrimination she's facing.\n\n4. **Event: The PTA exploits a loophole to arrange a separate prom for Emma, and Alyssa is too scared to stand up to her mother (Sentences 19-20).**\n   - Emma's state: Disheartened, feeling isolated again.\n   - Change: Despite the initial support, Emma's situation takes a turn for the worse as she's faced with the reality of being segregated and her girlfriend's inability to publicly support her.\n\n5. **Event: Emma decides to tell her story her own way, sings a song that goes viral, and later attends an all-inclusive prom thrown by the actors (Sentences 29-30).**\n   - Emma's state: Empowered, accepted, and in a better situation than at the start.\n   - Change: Emma takes control of her narrative, gains widespread support, and ends up celebrating her identity in a positive, supportive environment, significantly improving her situation from the beginning of the story.\n\nGiven these events and the changes in Emma's state, we can see that Emma starts in a disadvantaged situation (facing discrimination and potential isolation), faces additional challenges and setbacks (bullying, segregation), but ultimately ends in a much better situation (empowered, accepted, and celebrated). This pattern aligns with a story arc where the protagonist's condition improves from the first turning point to the last turning point, despite facing setbacks along the way.\n\nThe determined story arc type is Rags to Riches."

in possession of large quantities of illegal fentanyl pills.\n2) Everett University research scientist Dr. Tyrone Brower is contracted by Northlight Pharmaceuticals to carry out a study in support of their newest product, Klaralon.\n3) The drug is being touted as the first non-addictive painkiller and is due to be released shortly as a replacement for Oxycodone.\n4) The study uncovers concerning results; Klaralon initially presents as non-addictive when taken daily for the first 7 days (parameters specified by Northlight), however after 7 days it becomes almost three times more addictive than Oxycodone.\n5) Realising the public health implications, Brower recommends to Northlight they delay Klaralon's release for further testing, which they object to.\n6) Board member Dr. Bill Simons tries to tempt Brower into changing his mind by offering a large research grant, but Brower refuses.\n7) With Northlight being one of the university's main donors, Brower finds himself under pressure from department head Greg Talbot to approve the study, but again is reluctant.\n8) Northlight begins leaking information to discredit his reputation, and Everett University revokes his tenure.\n9) Desperate, Brower becomes a whistleblower and contacts the FDA, being put in contact with investigator Ben Walker.\n10) Detroit based DEA agent Jake Kelly has managed to infiltrate two large scale drug cartels running fentanyl.\n11) One is run by the Armenian Mafia who operate pill mills across the US.\n12) The other is based in Montreal, Quebec controlled by drug kingpin Claude 'Mother' Veroche, who operates out of a nondescript restaurant called La Marina.\n13) Kelly intends to convince the two cartels to enter into business, so both leaders can be arrested at once when they meet.\n14) Kelly has personal motivation for bringing them down, due to his younger sister suffering from crippling heroin addiction.\n15) Kelly's relationship with Mother becomes strained when news of Cedric's capture comes to light, with Mother becoming concerned there is an informant in his organisation.\n16) Due to operational funding concerns, Kelly's superior agent Garrett gives him a reduced timescale to organise the meet between the two cartels.\n17) Mother has Cedric killed in custody for his silence, and executes his second in command Guy Broussard after discovering he has been speaking with the authorities.\n18) Architect and recovering Oxycodone addict Claire Reimann becomes concerned when her 16-year-old son David does not return home from hockey practice.\n19) He is later found dead as a result of a fentanyl overdose, shocking Claire who is convinced he never took drugs.\n20) Although the Detroit Police Department treats it as an accidental death, she hires a private investigator who determines David was forced to take the fentanyl and was murdered.\n21) Through her son's social media she tracks down one of his friends, who confesses several teenagers from the hockey team (from both Detroit and Montreal) work for Mother as drug runners, although David had only done it once.\n22) Reimann crosses the Ambassador Bridge and travels to Montreal where she hires another private investigator, who provides her with information on Mother and a privately made firearm.\n23) She threatens another drug runner, Derrick Millebran, who believes that Mother is killing them to tie up loose ends after Cedric's arrest.\n24) Kelly becomes aware of Reimann's activities through investigation of Cedric's associates, and intercepts her outside La Marina.\n25) He does not arrest her, but instead unloads her gun and urges her to leave for her own good.\n26) The meeting between the two cartels goes ahead, covertly monitored by a joint DEA-RCMP taskforce.\n27) However, an RCMP surveillance officer accidentally gives away his position, resulting in a shootout that kills Kelly's partner, Special Agent Stanley Foster.\n28) Mother also escapes, believed to have fled to Algeria.\n29) Given the seizure of the drugs at the meet, both US and Canadian agencies decide to disband the continued search for Mother and the Armenians.\n30) Outraged, Kelly goes against orders and travels to La Marina, where he threatens an employee who tells him Mother is still in Canada but is planning to escape via seaplane that evening from the Port of Montreal.\n31) Reimann is also given this information from her private investigator.\n32) Kelly arrives at the port, but has been beaten there by Reimann, who opens fire and kills Mother as he makes his way to the aircraft.\n33) His bodyguard shoots her in the arm, but is swiftly shot by Kelly.\n34) He then replaces the men's weapons with Reimann's privately made firearm and his own unregistered back up gun, to make it appear they shot each other in a disagreement over money that was being carried by Mother at the time.\n35) He treats her gunshot wound, and tells her he does not intend to arrest her.\n36) A last ditch effort by Northlight, CEO Dr. Meg Holmes also fails to convince Brower to come on side, and the company is subjected to an FDA hearing.\n37) To Brower's shock, the agency does not revoke Northlight's permissions for Klaralon's release, noting that the potential benefits to the public outweigh the dangers highlighted by his study.\n38) Walker is also reassigned as a retaliatory measure.\n39) Despite the legal risk, Brower breaks his non-disclosure agreement and goes to the press, finally getting the information public.\n40) His integrity and honesty pays off, and he is later hired by the University of Michigan due to his actions, and is seen giving an introductory lecture to a crowded auditorium.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe story has multiple characters, but for the purpose of analyzing the story arc, we'll focus on Dr. Tyrone Brower as the primary protagonist, given his central role in the narrative's thematic concern with the ethical implications of pharmaceutical development.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. Dr. Brower discovers concerning results about Klaralon's addictive properties after 7 days of use (sentence 4).\n2. He recommends delaying Klaralon's release but faces opposition from Northlight Pharmaceuticals (sentence 5).\n3. Brower becomes a whistleblower and contacts the FDA (sentence 9).\n4. The FDA hearing does not result in the revocation of Northlight's permissions for Klaralon's release, prompting Brower to go to the press (sentences 36-37).\n5. Brower's integrity and honesty pay off, and he is later hired by the University of Michigan (sentence 40).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: Brower is in a position of professional integrity, having conducted a study that reveals critical information about Klaralon. His state is one of moral strength but also of impending conflict due to the implications of his findings.\n- **Event 2**: Brower's state worsens as he faces pressure and bribery attempts from Northlight and later from his own university, indicating a fall into a dilemma where his professional and ethical standings are challenged.\n- **Event 3**: By becoming a whistleblower, Brower takes a significant risk but acts in accordance with his ethical beliefs, showing a recovery in his moral stance but possibly a decline in his professional security.\n- **Event 4**: The FDA's decision not to revoke Klaralon's release despite Brower's evidence puts him in a deeper hole, professionally and ethically, as his efforts seem to be thwarted by the system.\n- **Event 5**: Brower's decision to go public with the information and his subsequent hiring by the University of Michigan mark a significant improvement in his state, both professionally and ethically, as his integrity is recognized and rewarded.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. Initially, Brower is in a strong moral and professional position. He then falls into a dilemma due to the opposition he faces from Northlight and his university, which challenges his professional and ethical standing. Despite setbacks, including the FDA's decision, Brower's actions ultimately lead to a higher state of recognition and respect for his integrity and honesty.\n\nThis pattern follows the **Man in a Hole** story arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma but finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning. Brower's journey from a position of strength, into conflict and professional jeopardy, and finally to a place of greater respect and recognition, aligns with this arc.\n\n### 4.

Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **At Event 1**, Briggs is in a low state, dealing with PTSD, the loss of his friend, and being deemed unfit for service. His condition is one of loss and stagnation.\n- **At Event 2**, Briggs's state slightly improves as he accepts the assignment, which gives him a sense of purpose. However, his overall condition remains challenging due to his struggles with Lulu and his personal issues.\n- **At Event 3**, Briggs experiences a significant improvement in his state. He begins to form a deeper connection with Lulu, which helps him address his PTSD and personal growth. This event marks a turning point where Briggs starts to heal and find a new sense of purpose.\n- **At Event 4**, Briggs's state further improves as he decides to save Lulu, showing empathy and a willingness to take responsibility for another being. This act symbolizes his growth and ability to make positive decisions.\n- **At Event 5**, Briggs is in a much better state than at the beginning.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Jagger, an impulsive science enthusiast. However, as the story progresses, it becomes clear that Neo, another science enthusiast, also plays a significant role, making them both central to the narrative. For the purpose of this analysis, we will consider Jagger and Neo as the protagonists.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. Jagger's solar system model shatters, releasing hydrogen sulphide gas, causing chaos (sentences 1-4).\n2. The principal tasks Jagger and Neo with creating a fool-proof science project for the school's science fair (sentence 8).\n3. Jagger and Neo successfully create a revolutionary fire-extinguishing compound named \"FireBEGone\" (sentence 12).\n4. Brandon sabotages their plans by swapping \"FireBEGone\" with a fire-enhancing chemical, leading to an unexpected inferno at the science fair (sentences 14-18).\n5. The inferno is replaced by a foam-filled spectacle, and Jagger and Neo are celebrated as heroes (sentences 19-22).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (sentences 1-4):** Jagger's condition starts in a state of accident and chaos, causing disruption in the school. This can be considered a low point due to the negative consequences of his actions.\n- **Event 2 (sentence 8):** After the initial chaos, Jagger (and now including Neo as they work together) is given a chance to redeem themselves by the principal. This marks a turning point where they have the opportunity to improve their situation, indicating a potential rise in their condition.\n- **Event 3 (sentence 12):** With the successful creation of \"FireBEGone,\" Jagger and Neo achieve a significant success, improving their condition. They are on a path to redemption and recognition.\n- **Event 4 (sentences 14-18):** The sabotage by Brandon leads to another failure, causing an inferno at the science fair. This event marks a downturn in their condition, as their success is temporarily thwarted by external interference.\n- **Event 5 (sentences 19-22):** Despite the initial failure, the unexpected outcome of the foam filling the school leads to Jagger and Neo being celebrated as heroes. This marks a significant improvement in their condition, as they achieve recognition and admiration.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, we observe that Jagger and Neo start in a disadvantaged situation (causing chaos), then face a challenge (to create a successful science project), achieve success (\"FireBEGone\"), experience a setback (the inferno), and finally end in a better situation (being celebrated as heroes). This pattern shows that the protagonists fall into a dilemma (the initial accident and subsequent challenges), find a way out (creating \"FireBEGone\" and eventually the foam incident), and end better than at the beginning (being hailed as heroes).\n\nThe story arc that best fits this description is the \"Man in a Hole\" arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma and finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning. The initial failure, followed by a series of challenges and eventual success, aligns with this arc type.\n\n### 4. Determined Story Arc Type\n\nMan in a Hole"

        "output": "### TASK 1: Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\n\nThe protagonist in the story is Augustus Landor, an alcoholic retired detective. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. Landor is asked by the military to investigate the hanging of Cadet Leroy Fry (sentence 1).\n2. Landor and Poe suspect the family of Dr. Daniel Marquis, who performed the autopsy on Fry (sentence 11).\n3. Poe is drugged and finds Artemus and Lea about to cut out his heart in accordance with the ritual (sentence 14).\n4. It becomes apparent that Landor was the killer of the cadets (sentence 18).\n5. Poe tells Landor he has two notes with handwriting samples that link Landor directly to the murders, but burns them instead (sentence 27).\n\n### TASK 2: Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n1. **Initial Event**: At the beginning, Landor is in a low state, being an alcoholic and a widower whose daughter has run off. His condition is poor, both physically and emotionally.\n2. **Suspicion of Dr. Marquis' Family**: As Landor delves deeper into the case with Poe, he becomes more engaged and seemingly starts to recover from his alcoholism and personal losses, driven by the investigation. His condition starts to improve as he finds purpose.\n3. **Poe's Discovery**: When Poe is almost killed by Artemus and Lea, Landor rescues him, which could be seen as a peak in his recovery and investigative success. However, this event also marks a turning point where Landor's true nature begins to unravel.\n4. **Revelation of Landor's Guilt**: The revelation that Landor is the killer of the cadets marks a significant downfall. His condition worsens as his dark past and true intentions are exposed, showing that his initial recovery was superficial.\n5. **Final Confrontation with Poe**: After the truth is out, and despite Poe choosing not to turn him in, Landor's emotional state reaches a nadir. He is forced to confront the consequences of his actions and the loss of his daughter. His condition is at its lowest, reflecting on his vengeance and its costs.\n\n### TASK 3: Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, it starts low (due to personal losses and alcoholism), rises as Landor finds purpose in the investigation, peaks when he rescues Poe, and then drastically falls when his true nature and actions are revealed. This pattern matches the **Icarus** story arc, where the protagonist rises to a peak but then faces a significant downfall. Landor's rise is not about achieving success or happiness but about finding a temporary distraction from his pain and a means to exact revenge. His downfall is not just about being caught but also about the emotional and moral implications of his actions being laid bare.\n\n### TASK 4: Determined Story Arc Type\n\nIcarus"

Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Joe is at the peak of his success, admired and celebrated.\n- **Event 2**: Joe's state has significantly worsened; he is lonely, depressed, and his career is in shambles. This is a low point compared to his past success.\n- **Event 3**: The appearance of Joey introduces conflict and self-doubt, but also sparks a desire for change. Joe's state is still low but with a glimmer of potential for improvement.\n- **Event 4**: Joe starts to take action towards redeeming his career and personal life, showing improvement from his previous state of despair.\n- **Event 5**: Joe achieves a form of success and personal growth, accepting his past and present selves. His state has improved significantly from the low point in Event 2, and he has found a new path to success and happiness.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. Initially, Joe is in a state of success, which drastically declines. However, with the catalyst of Joey's appearance, Joe begins a journey of self-discovery and improvement. This journey involves facing his past mistakes, finding a new path in his career, and ultimately achieving success again, albeit in a different form.\n\nThe key elements here are the fall from success to a low point (Event 2) and the subsequent rise to a new form of success (Event 5).

However, it impacts John's state by increasing his determination and possibly his emotional involvement in the case. His condition has worsened in terms of the risks and challenges he and his team face.\n- **Event 4**: John's state is one of heightened urgency and risk as Sarah's mission and subsequent injury raise the stakes. His condition is critical, as the success of their mission hangs in the balance, and he faces the loss of a key team member.\n- **Event 5**: John's state is one of resolve and vindication as he succeeds in his battle against the corrupt officials and brings about justice for the victims of Alliance 127. His condition has improved significantly, as he has achieved his goals and found a form of closure, albeit at a great cost.\n\n### 3.

Despite these setbacks, John ultimately succeeds in his mission, achieving a better state than at the beginning by bringing justice and transparency (improving condition).\n\nThis pattern fits the **Man in a Hole** story arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (the complexities and dangers of the case) and finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning (achieving justice and closure).\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Henry Pelham, a CIA officer. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. Henry is informed about the reopening of the Turkish Alliance 127 case and is sent to interview Celia Harrison (sentence 1-3).\n2. Henry meets Celia at a restaurant, and she reveals that an Austrian intelligence agent approached her (sentence 6-8).\n3. Through a flashback, it's revealed that Henry betrayed his informant, Ilyas, to the Russian government, which led to a series of tragic events (sentence 15).\n4. Celia discovers that Henry was the leak who betrayed the CIA to the terrorists and confronts him about it (sentence 22-23).\n5. Henry is poisoned by Celia, with the help of Karl Stein, as revenge for his betrayal (sentence 26-31).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Henry is in a position of authority and trust within the CIA, tasked with investigating a significant case. His state is one of responsibility and integrity.\n- **Event 2**: Henry's meeting with Celia brings up past personal and professional issues, but he still maintains his position of trust and authority. However, there's a hint of personal vulnerability.\n- **Event 3**: The revelation of Henry's past betrayal of Ilyas shows a moral compromise that led to tragic consequences. This indicates a flaw in Henry's character and judgment but doesn't immediately affect his current state as a trusted CIA officer.\n- **Event 4**: When Celia confronts Henry about being the leak, his state drastically changes. He is exposed, and his betrayal is revealed, leading to a loss of trust and authority.\n- **Event 5**: Henry's poisoning and impending death mark the ultimate downfall. He loses everything: his life, his career, and any semblance of redemption or forgiveness.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on Henry's condition throughout the story, it starts with him in a high-status position within the CIA, tasked with an important investigation. However, as the story unfolds, his past mistakes and betrayals are revealed, leading to a drastic downfall. He loses the trust of his peers, faces the consequences of his actions, and ultimately dies. This pattern follows a specific story arc where the protagonist starts in a high position but ends in a significantly lower state due to their actions or flaws.\n\nThe story arc type that best fits this description is one where the protagonist's condition worsens from the first turning point to the last turning point, indicating a fall from grace or a high status to a much lower one.\n\n### 4.

rich past beneath an artfully woven web of lies.\n22) With courage and firm conviction, they unveiled Mayor Freeman's guilt, banishing him from his respected stature to wearing the disdainful crown of a town villain.\n23) This unexpected development sent seismic waves of disbelief throughout Laramie, threatening to shatter its peace.\n24) Amid the ensuing chaos, John and Lily found solace and love

anticipated.\n26) Embracing their newfound romance, they decided to plant their roots in Laramie, seeing it no longer as an obligatory stop but as a cherished home.\n27) With this poignant realization, they felt an overwhelming sense of responsibility: leveraging their unique knowledge to lead the town towards comprehensive transparency.\n28) Their new label as Laramie's 'truth seekers' propelled them to mend their fractured community and advocate honesty, essential for the town's resurgence.\n29) They devoted countless hours strategizing effective ways to nourish their beloved town

Her departure from Seapoint and beginning of her university life (sentences 24-30)\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Graduation):** Rebecca is introverted and somewhat disconnected from her peers, focusing on her future plans rather than celebrating with others. Her state is one of quiet contemplation and slight disconnection.\n  \n- **Event 2 (Arrival in Seapoint):** Upon arriving in Seapoint, Rebecca's state is marked by a sense of awkwardness, especially in her interactions with her estranged father. The silence between them highlights a period of adjustment and uncertainty.\n\n- **Event 3 (Exploration of Seapoint):** As Rebecca meets new people like Jake, Evelyn, and Emily, her state begins to shift towards openness and engagement.

She carries the wisdom and fond memories of Seapoint with her, indicating personal growth and a positive outlook on her future.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. Initially, Rebecca is in a state of quiet introversion and disconnection, which can be considered a lower state. As the story progresses, she faces challenges and undergoes significant personal growth, leading to a higher state of confidence, connection, and maturity by the end of the story. This trajectory, where the protagonist starts in a disadvantaged or lower state and ends in a much better or higher state, aligns with the **Rags to Riches** story arc type. The key characteristic of this arc is the improvement in the protagonist's condition from the beginning to the end, which is clearly evident in Rebecca's transformation from an introverted high school graduate to a confident and mature young woman ready to face new challenges.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Auden West, an 18-year-old recent high school graduate. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. Auden arrives in Colby to spend the summer with her father (sentence 1).\n2. Auden meets Eli, a fellow insomniac, and they start going on nightly adventures (sentence 9).\n3. Auden learns about Eli's past and his accident, which killed his best friend Abe (sentence 16).\n4. Auden and Eli have a temporary falling out over biking, but they eventually make up (sentences 32 and 35).\n5. Auden and her friends have an impromptu prom party at the beach, marking a significant moment of joy and connection for Auden (sentence 37).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1 (Arrival in Colby):** Auden's state is one of seeking change and reinvention. She wants to spend a carefree summer before college, indicating a desire to break away from her past and explore new aspects of herself. Her condition is somewhat uncertain and open to growth.\n  \n- **Event 2 (Meeting Eli):** Auden's state improves as she finds companionship and excitement in her nightly adventures with Eli. This marks a positive change from her initial solo explorations and indicates a move towards a more fulfilling and enjoyable life.\n\n- **Event 3 (Learning about Eli's Past):** Auden's understanding of Eli deepens, but this event also introduces a note of seriousness and tragedy into their relationship. While this doesn't necessarily worsen Auden's condition, it adds complexity to her interactions and emotional landscape.\n\n- **Event 4 (Falling Out with Eli):** Auden experiences a setback in her relationship with Eli, which temporarily worsens her state. This conflict, however, leads to personal growth and a deeper understanding of herself and Eli, as they eventually resolve their issues.\n\n- **Event 5 (Impromptu Prom Party):** Auden's state improves significantly as she experiences joy, connection, and a sense of belonging with her friends. This event symbolizes her growth and the positive changes she has undergone during her summer in Colby.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on Auden's condition throughout the story, it starts with her seeking change and ends with her experiencing significant personal growth and happiness. The story involves Auden facing challenges and setbacks (like her temporary falling out with Eli and dealing with her family dynamics) but ultimately rising above them to achieve a better state. This pattern does not fit the \"Rags to Riches\" classification provided, as Auden does not start in a clearly disadvantaged situation and end in a much better one in the traditional sense of wealth or status. Instead, her journey is more about emotional and personal growth.\n\nThe story more closely aligns with the \"Cinderella\" story arc type, where the protagonist rises, faces a setback, and ultimately achieves a higher state. Auden's rise is her growth and happiness in Colby, the setback is her conflict with Eli and her family issues, and the ultimate achievement is her finding joy, love, and a sense of self by the end of the summer.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Charlie McGee, a young girl with pyrokinesis powers. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Charlie's Nightmare and Loss of Control**: Charlie has a nightmare and her parents discuss her unstable powers (sentences 3-4).\n2. **The Death of Charlie's Mother**: Rainbird kills Charlie's mother, leading to Charlie and her father escaping (sentences 10-12).\n3. **Charlie's Escape and Growth**: Charlie escapes from her captors and hones her powers in the forest (sentences 21-22).\n4. **The Rescue and Tragic Turn**: Charlie rescues her father from the DSI facility but is tricked into burning him and others (sentences 25-28).\n5. **The Final Confrontation and Resolution**: Charlie spares Rainbird's life and burns down the DSI facility, walking away with him (sentences 32-35).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Charlie's Nightmare and Loss of Control)**: Charlie is in a vulnerable state, struggling with her powers and being bullied at school. Her condition is tense and precarious.\n- **Event 2 (The Death of Charlie's Mother)**: Charlie's state worsens significantly as she experiences trauma and loss. She and her father are forced to flee, making their situation dire.\n- **Event 3 (Charlie's Escape and Growth)**: Charlie's condition improves as she learns to control her powers and becomes more independent. This marks a turning point in her ability to cope with her circumstances.\n- **Event 4 (The Rescue and Tragic Turn)**: Charlie's state becomes extremely tragic. Despite her growth, she is manipulated into causing destruction and harm to those she loves, leading to a deep emotional and moral conflict.\n- **Event 5 (The Final Confrontation and Resolution)**: Charlie's condition reaches a point of resolution and potential redemption. She chooses to spare a life and finds a form of companionship or understanding with Rainbird, indicating a move towards healing and a new path.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc can be classified based on how Charlie's condition changes throughout the narrative. Initially, Charlie is in a vulnerable state, which worsens after her mother's death. However, she then experiences growth and improvement as she learns to control her powers. This is followed by a tragic turn of events, but ultimately, she finds a path towards redemption and a new beginning.\n\nGiven these changes, the story does not fit neatly into a simple \"Rags to Riches\" or \"Riches to Rags\" narrative, as Charlie's journey involves both significant downturns and moments of growth. The \"Man in a Hole\" arc is closer, as Charlie falls into dilemmas (her loss of control, her mother's death) and finds ways out (learning to control her powers, choosing to spare Rainbird), ending in a better emotional state than where she began, despite the tragic events.\n\nThe \"Double Man in a Hole\" arc seems most appropriate because Charlie faces two major cycles of falling into a dilemma and recovering: the first cycle involves her initial struggles and the traumatic event of her mother's death, from which she recovers by escaping and growing; the second cycle involves her tragic manipulation into burning her father and others, from which she recovers by finding redemption in sparing Rainbird's life and walking away from the destruction.\n\n### 4.

Five major events in the story are:\n1. **Discovery of the Puzzle Chamber**: When Emma and Jake first wake up in the intimidating, cave-like chamber filled with puzzles and riddles that they must solve to survive (sentences 1-6).\n2. **Escape from the Initial Puzzle Chamber**: After solving the puzzles, they manage to escape the deadly confinement, marking a significant turning point in their ordeal (sentences 9-10).\n3. **Investigation and Discovery of Sphinx Corp**: Emma and Jake's research and investigation lead them to uncover the existence of Sphinx Corp, the organization behind their ordeal, and they begin to plan how to infiltrate it (sentences 14-16).\n4. **Infiltration of Sphinx Corp and Second Puzzle Chamber**: They infiltrate Sphinx Corp, only to find themselves facing another, even more complex puzzle chamber, set by the enigmatic CEO, Enigma (sentences 22-26).\n5. **Final Confrontation and Escape**: Emma and Jake solve the final puzzle, triggering the self-destruction of Sphinx Corp's headquarters, and they escape, bringing an end to their dangerous mission (sentences 37-40).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Discovery of the Puzzle Chamber)**: Emma and Jake are in a state of fear, confusion, and vulnerability. They are trapped and must rely on their wits to survive.\n- **Event 2 (Escape from the Initial Puzzle Chamber)**: Their state improves significantly as they escape, feeling a sense of relief and accomplishment. However, they are also driven by a desire for justice, setting the stage for their next actions.\n- **Event 3 (Investigation and Discovery of Sphinx Corp)**: They are determined and proactive, taking control of their situation by investigating and planning. Their state is one of focused resolve.\n- **Event 4 (Infiltration of Sphinx Corp and Second Puzzle Chamber)**: Despite their preparations, they face a setback as they encounter another puzzle chamber, placing them in a state of heightened fear and urgency. However, their experience and bond help them tackle this challenge.\n- **Event 5 (Final Confrontation and Escape)**: Emma and Jake reach a peak state of determination and teamwork, successfully solving the final puzzle and escaping. They emerge victorious, having overcome their challenges and achieved their goal of bringing down Sphinx Corp.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc can be classified by analyzing the change in the protagonists' state throughout the narrative. Initially, Emma and Jake are in a dire situation (low point), then they improve their condition by escaping (rise), only to face another challenge (setback) when they infiltrate Sphinx Corp. However, they ultimately overcome this challenge as well, achieving a higher state than before by succeeding in their mission and finding justice (higher rise).\n\nThis pattern resembles the **Cinderella** story arc, where the protagonist rises, faces a setback, and ultimately achieves a higher state. The protagonists start in a vulnerable state, rise by escaping the first puzzle chamber, face a significant setback by encountering another deadly challenge, but ultimately achieve a higher state by solving the final puzzle, escaping, and bringing down Sphinx Corp.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Zoey Davis.

Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: At the beginning, Zoey is proactive and determined, having just escaped an escape room and seeking to confront the Minos Corporation. Her state is one of empowerment and readiness for challenge.\n- **Event 2**: Zoey's state changes to one of horror and urgency as she realizes she and others are trapped in another deadly game. This marks a significant downturn in her condition as she faces immediate danger.\n- **Event 3**: After the beach room, Zoey experiences a mix of emotions - grief over the loss of companions, frustration with the group's dynamics, but also relief and determination to survive. Her condition is fraught with emotional turmoil but still focused on survival.\n- **Event 4**: Discovering the truth about the escape rooms and meeting Amanda Harper brings a sense of understanding and possibly empathy to Zoey's state. However, it also deepens her realization of the sinister nature of Minos and her own entrapment, making her condition more complex and possibly more desperate.\n- **Event 5**: The final event shows Zoey in a state of false security, believing she has overcome her challenges, only to be thrust back into danger. This reveals that despite her efforts and small victories, her overall condition has not improved significantly in terms of safety and security.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the changes in Zoey's state throughout the story, it seems that her condition starts with a sense of empowerment and readiness for challenge. However, as the story progresses, she faces numerous setbacks, dangers, and emotional challenges. Despite moments of relief and small victories, the overall trajectory of her condition is one of worsening circumstances, especially considering the final event where she is once again trapped in an escape room. This pattern does not fit the \"Rags to Riches,\" \"Man in a Hole,\" \"Cinderella,\" or \"Double Man in a Hole\" story arcs, as those typically involve an overall improvement in the protagonist's condition by the end. It also doesn't perfectly match \"Icarus\" or \"Oedipus,\" as those involve a rise followed by a fall, but Zoey's story is more about a series of challenges and dangers that escalate rather than a rise and fall. The closest match based on the provided description and the story's progression is \"Riches to Rags,\" as Zoey's condition worsens from the beginning to the end, considering her final state of being trapped again.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story can be identified as Alice, given that the narrative follows her journey and emotional state closely, especially in the latter parts of the story. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. Alice and her husband Tom rent a mid-century modern home in San Diego for a weekend getaway (sentence 6).\n2. Strange events occur at the house, including a bird crashing into the window and a shadowy figure watching them (sentence 7).\n3. The delivery driver is murdered, and Alice is unable to save him, leading to her being interrogated by the police (sentences 9-12).\n4. Tom investigates the house and discovers its dark history, including the story of Frederick Banner and his involvement in occult practices (sentences 13-20).\n5. Alice is confronted by Eldridge, who intends to use her in a ritual, but she and Tom (possessing Alice) manage to kill the sons of Frederick and escape (sentences 26-32).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1:** Alice's state is one of attempting to escape her stressful life as a doctor and find relaxation with her husband. She is hopeful for a better time.\n- **Event 2:** Alice's state becomes one of fear and confusion as she experiences unexplained phenomena. Her condition worsens as she feels unsafe.\n- **Event 3:** Alice's state deteriorates further as she is faced with the reality of murder and is interrogated by the police. She is under stress and potentially in danger.\n- **Event 4:** Although this event primarily focuses on Tom, it indirectly affects Alice by putting her in greater danger due to Tom's investigations. Her state remains precarious.\n- **Event 5:** Alice's state reaches a climax as she is directly threatened by Eldridge. However, through her actions and Tom's possession, she manages to overcome this threat. Despite the ordeal, she survives and escapes the immediate danger.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the progression of Alice's state throughout the story, it starts with her seeking relaxation and improvement in her life, then faces a series of worsening events that put her in danger, both physically and emotionally. The story's climax shows her in a desperate fight for survival, but she manages to overcome the immediate threat. However, considering the overall trajectory from a state of seeking betterment to facing significant dangers and traumas, the story leans towards a pattern where the protagonist's condition worsens over time due to the escalating threats and dangers.\n\nThe initial classification provided is \"Riches to Rags,\" which typically involves a protagonist starting in a high-status position and ending in a significantly lower state. While Alice's journey does involve a decline from a hopeful start to facing severe challenges, the story's complexity, with its supernatural elements and the ultimate act of survival and revenge, suggests a more nuanced interpretation might be necessary. However, focusing strictly on the protagonist's condition and the overall direction of change, the story does align with a \"Riches to Rags\" arc in the sense that Alice's situation and state deteriorate significantly from the beginning to the end, despite her ultimate survival.\n\n### 4.

quaint, colonial-style houses, lives a thoughtful teenager named Sarah Thompson within the tender embrace of her doting parents, Mark and Laura.\n3) Unlike many teenagers, Sarah's unique prowess lay in her deep introverted character and voracious curiosity for mysteries.\n4) Each free hour she found was lost in the riveting pages of detective novels like those by Agatha Christie and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.\n5) As the calendar marked December, Oakville transformed.\n6) But, within these harmonious happenings, Sarah was beginning to notice a strange pattern.\n7) Trivial things like moderate relocations of furniture or sudden appearances of cutlery in strange places started raising unsettling questions, sowing seeds of doubt and concern in her mind.\n8) As the nights grew longer, Sarah began to sense an unnatural thickness in the air.\n9) In disturbing interruptions of the night silence, she would hear cryptic whispers of miscreants, she noted the subtle displacement of household items, and most disconcerting of all, an uncanny feeling of being watched by an unknown entity.\n10) One clear December night, Sarah discerned a hazy figure through her bedroom window.\n11) With fear nestling in her heart, and curiosity fuelling her resolve, Sarah decided she couldn't let this masked intruder become a threat to her family.\n12) She chose to challenge this unknown terror.\n13) Determined, Sarah embarked on a journey to the Oakville police station, riding her faithful old bicycle under the chilly winter sky.\n14) To her dismay, the local police dismissed her allegations, attributing them to an overactive imagination which they believed was induced by her excessive indulgence in detective literature.\n15) This setback, however, did not dishearten Sarah.\n16) Her resolve hardened, and she decided to conduct her private investigation, much akin to the detectives in her novels.\n17) Sarah invested her considerable energy into observing the neighborhood through her wide-rimmed glasses and found shocking similarities in her neighbors' experiences.\n18) Combining the various shreds of gathered information, Sarah made a shocking connection.\n19) The disturbed homes had a shared history with a tragic fire that engulfed a part of Oakville four decades ago, claiming lives and properties.\n20) One fateful stormy night, amidst the crashing thunder and lightning flashes, Sarah had an unsettling encounter in her own warm living room with the very intruder she was seeking.\n21) The masked figure left a hastily scribbled warning note for Sarah, meant to deter her pursuit.\n22) Terrified yet defiant, overcoming the overwhelming fear, Sarah unearthed a newfound courage within herself.\n23) She continued with her investigative pursuits more determined than ever before.\n24) Tracking incidents at various locations across Oakville and connecting the cryptic clues left by the stalker, Sarah was successful in unveiling the man behind the mask – a woman named Martha Green who was purportedly a victim of the deadly fire.\n25) Undeterred by the grim reality and potential danger, Sarah, impelled by her belief in justice, confronted Martha, face-to-face, unmasking her and her deeds.\n26) Martha confessed to Sarah that she had no intentions to harm.\n27) She was, in fact, targeting these houses as her silent protest for all the injustices she had suffered.\n28) With wisdom and empathy surprising for her age, Sarah convinced Martha to give up her discreet protests and to seek justice in a legal manner.\n29) Martha agreed and vowed to surrender, leaving a wave of anon her decision.\n30) The two then traveled to the police station on a chilly morning, leaving the officers aghast and feeling regretful for soundlessly dismissing Sarah's plea.\n31) Keeping their word to Sarah, the police took Martha into custody while apologizing to the brave teen.\n32) Gradually, the town of Oakville found its way back to the peace and tranquility it was known for.\n33) However, Sarah's reputation had undergone a significant transformation.\n34) The once reticent teenager was now celebrated as a brave detective, and her name was whispered with respect and admiration whenever mentioned.\n35) In a cinematic contrast, Martha, the once-dreaded entity, was seen being driven away in a black and white police vehicle.\n36) The replays of her tear-streaked face in the rearview mirror added a touch of finality to this incredible tale, marking the end of the sinister wave that had shaken the town of Oakville.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to

Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the progression of Sarah's state throughout the story, it's clear that she faces a dilemma (the mysterious occurrences and the police's dismissal) and then finds a way out, ending in a better state than at the beginning. She starts with a sense of unease and doubt, falls into a deeper concern as the events escalate, but then rises as she takes control of the investigation, eventually overcoming her fears and solving the mystery.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Sam Hodges, the father and husband in the Hodges family. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **The Break-in and Vandalism**: The story begins with a break-in at the Hodges' home, where a masked individual is seen, and later, vandalism occurs, including a dead deer found in Rebecca's car trunk.\n2. **The Revelation of Sam's Affair**: It is revealed that Sam is having an affair with Julia, a paralegal at his law firm, which adds a layer of complexity to his character and the family's situation.\n3. **The Murder of Layne**: Sam kills Layne, believing him to be the stalker, only to later discover that he was incorrect, and the real stalker had been watching him the entire time.\n4. **The Confrontation at the Church**: Sam's panic and paranoia reach a peak at the church during a faith healing ceremony, where he mistakenly accuses a child of being the stalker due to a cast on the child's hand, not realizing the actual stalker has missing fingers.\n5. **The Final Confrontation and Revelation**: The story culminates in a dramatic confrontation where Sam is forced to reveal his dark past, including the rape of a girl named Molly in college, leading to a tragic outcome for all involved.\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **At the first event (The Break-in and Vandalism)**: Sam is concerned for his family's safety but also suspicious of his daughter's boyfriend, Layne. His state is one of caution and mistrust.\n- **At the second event (The Revelation of Sam's Affair)**: Sam's personal life is complicated by his affair, showing a lack of integrity and honesty, especially towards his wife. His state becomes more complex, with guilt and secrecy added to his concerns.\n- **At the third event (The Murder of Layne)**: Sam's actions lead to a tragic mistake, killing an innocent person. His state deteriorates to one of horror, guilt, and desperation.\n- **At the fourth event (The Confrontation at the Church)**: Sam's paranoia and guilt reach a boiling point, leading to a public outburst. His state is one of complete desperation and loss of control.\n- **At the fifth event (The Final Confrontation and Revelation)**: Sam is forced to confront his darkest secret and the consequences of his actions. His state ends in shame, loss, and a complete downfall from his initial position of a respected family man.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, it's clear that Sam starts in a relatively high position as a respected attorney and family man but gradually falls into a deeper and deeper hole due to his own actions and secrets. The story arc follows a pattern where the protagonist's condition worsens significantly from the beginning to the end, with moments of attempted recovery or hiding of his true state, but ultimately leading to a drastic downfall.\n\nThe story fits the **Oedipus** story arc type because Sam starts in a high position, falls due to his flaws (the affair, mistrust, and eventually the revelation of his past crime), attempts to recover or hide his situation, but ultimately faces another significant downfall when his darkest secret is revealed, leading to his complete loss of status, respect, and family trust.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\nThe protagonist of the story is Alex, the 'Genie' of the high school play who is transgender. Five major events in the story are:\n1. Alex decides to reveal his transgender identity to Sam (sentence 3).\n2. Alex delivers a compelling coming-out speech to hundreds of his peers (sentence 6).\n3. Alex challenges the notoriously grumpy gym coach to use the girl's locker room (sentence 9).\n4. Alex and Jessica share a slow dance at Prom Night and are crowned Prom King and Queen (sentences 16-17).\n5. The high school gym becomes a warm, welcoming space filled with acceptance as the school adopts a transgender awareness program (sentences 19-20).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes\n- **Event 1 (Revealing Identity to Sam):** Alex is in a vulnerable state, deciding to share a personal and potentially risky aspect of his life with a friend. This is a turning point because it marks the beginning of Alex's journey towards openness and self-acceptance.\n- **Event 2 (Coming-out Speech):** Alex shows bravery and determination, taking a significant step towards public self-acceptance and advocacy. His state has improved from vulnerability to empowerment.\n- **Event 3 (Challenging the Gym Coach):** Alex faces opposition but stands firm in his advocacy for transgender rights. This event shows Alex in a state of resilience and activism, further empowered from his previous actions.\n- **Event 4 (Prom Night Success):** Alex experiences acceptance and happiness, culminating in a moment of joy and recognition with his peers. His state has improved to one of acceptance and celebration.\n- **Event 5 (School-wide Acceptance):** Alex's efforts lead to a significant positive change in his environment, marking a peak in his journey towards acceptance and happiness. His state is one of fulfillment and success.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\nThe story arc type can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. Alex starts in a potentially vulnerable state (due to the risk of rejection or discrimination), rises to a state of empowerment and acceptance through his bravery and advocacy, faces challenges but overcomes them, and ultimately achieves a higher state of acceptance and happiness. This pattern matches the **Cinderella** story arc, where the protagonist rises, faces a setback, and ultimately achieves a higher state. In Alex's journey, the rise is his decision to be open about his identity and his advocacy, the setback could be considered the challenges he faces (like the confrontation with the gym coach or the potential for backlash), and the ultimate achievement is the widespread acceptance and the success at Prom Night, culminating in a positive change in his school environment.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story can be considered as Kelsa, given that the narrative revolves significantly around her experiences, struggles, and emotional journey as a transgender high school student. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n- Event 1: Kelsa and Khal begin to develop a mutual attraction in their art class (sentence 5).\n- Event 2: Khal decides to act on his feelings and gives flowers to Kelsa at lunch, publicly declaring his interest (sentence 11).\n- Event 3: Kelsa and Khal decide to go for a relationship despite the risk of losing friends, marking a significant commitment to each other (sentence 14).\n- Event 4: Kelsa faces a severe setback when she is banned from the women's locker rooms and bathrooms due to fabricated accusations by Em and Otis (sentence 24).\n- Event 5: Kelsa and Khal reconcile after overcoming several challenges, including social stigma, personal insecurities, and external obstacles, and they eventually part amicably as Kelsa prepares to leave for college (sentences 32-35).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Kelsa's state is one of cautious exploration, as she begins to develop feelings for Khal. This marks an improvement from her initial state of secrecy and potential loneliness.\n- **Event 2**: Kelsa's state improves further as she receives public acknowledgment of Khal's feelings, indicating a move towards openness and acceptance.\n- **Event 3**: This event signifies a peak in Kelsa's state, as she and Khal commit to their relationship despite potential backlash, showing courage and determination.\n- **Event 4**: Kelsa's state worsens significantly as she faces discrimination and isolation, being banned from the women's locker rooms and bathrooms, and dealing with rumors and misunderstandings.\n- **Event 5**: Kelsa's state recovers as she and Khal reconcile, and she finds a sense of closure and growth. Although they part ways, it's on amicable terms, and Kelsa seems more confident and prepared for her future.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the analysis, Kelsa's journey can be seen as starting from a place of vulnerability and secrecy, rising to a point of openness and commitment, facing a significant downfall due to external and internal challenges, and then recovering to a state of growth and acceptance. This pattern aligns with the **Oedipus** story arc type, which involves a protagonist starting high, falling, recovering, and then facing another significant downfall, but in Kelsa's case, the final state is one of recovery and personal growth rather than a downfall.\n\nThe Oedipus arc is characterized by a rise, a fall, a recovery, and sometimes another fall. In Kelsa's story, the rise is her blossoming relationship with Khal and her decision to be open about it. The fall is the discrimination and personal challenges she faces afterward. The recovery is her reconciliation with Khal, finding support, and ultimately parting on good terms as she moves forward with her life.\n\n### 4. Determined Story Arc Type\n\nOedipus"

a puzzle demanding Jack's expertise in putting together.\n9) Bringing his concerns to his superiors at the police headquarters resulted in dismissive laughter and gentle ribbing towards his supposed active imagination.\n10) Despite their lack of support, Jack couldn't simply brush off the brewing danger his instinct was warning him about.\n11) Choosing to act on his alert intuition rather than give ear to skeptical colleagues, Jack delved deeper into Stanley's background.\n12) To his horror, he uncovered a significant fact.\n13) Stanley was an ex-convict with a history intertwined with occult practices - facts that startled Jack and set off alarm bells in his mind.\n14) Immersed in his off-duty detective work, Jack did not realize that Stanley was watching him.\n15) That oversight led to a dangerous confrontation in a gloom-ridden alleyway, landing Jack with a few nasty bruises and a larger, more potent determination.\n16) Despite his physical injuries, Jack's determination only strengthened.\n17) He was certain the disaster threatening Middleton had roots in Stanley's arrival, and he was hell-bent on averting it.\n18) Decidedly alone in his defense of Middleton, Jack took on the role of a secret guardian, tracking Stanley's movements under the cover of the night, determined to catch him in the act.\n19) This dedication eventually led him to a shocking discovery -

an enduring commitment to shield their community from threats obscure and conspicuous.\n38) Jack, in his ever-modest demeanor, dismissed any heroic tag, highlighting the shared responsibility among all law enforcers to remain vigilant, always ready to face incognito threats lurking in their idyllic neighborhoods.\n39) Jack played a vital role in reuniting the rescued children with their euphoric families.\n40) His relentless pursuit of justice had once more reinstated a sense of safety in the heart of Middleton, reaffirming the town's faith in the law.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better (e.g., 0→1→2→4→10)\n- Riches to Rags: Protagonist starts high and ends lower (e.g., 10→9→8→6→0)\n- Man in a Hole: Protagonist falls into trouble but recovers (e.g., 6→2→1→4→10)\n- Icarus: Protagonist rises then falls dramatically (e.g., 2→4→9→5→1)\n- Double Man in a Hole: Two cycles of fall and recovery (e.g., 6→2→7→4→10)\n- Cinderella: Rise, setback, ultimate triumph (e.g., 1→7→4→1→10)\n- Oedipus: Start high, fall, recover, final fall (e.g., 10→4→7→9→1)",

Her condition is neutral, with a slight disadvantage due to her recent altercation.\n- **Event 2**: Lomito-Smith's state worsens as she discovers Ganning's body and the circumstances of his death. She is now in a dilemma, seeking justice and truth.\n- **Event 3**: Her state improves slightly as she uncovers the truth about Demarco's death, giving her a sense of purpose and vindication. However, this also puts her in greater danger.\n- **Event 4**: Lomito-Smith's state becomes more dangerous and precarious as she confronts corrupt officers. She faces a significant risk to her life and career.\n- **Event 5**: Ultimately, Lomito-Smith's state improves as she sees justice served through Demarco's spirit and finds a sense of peace and closure, both for herself and Taneesha.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the protagonist's condition throughout the story, it can be observed that Officer Lomito-Smith faces multiple dilemmas and recoveries. Initially, she is in a somewhat disadvantaged position returning to duty after an altercation. She then falls into a deeper dilemma upon discovering the truth about her colleagues' misconduct and the supernatural events surrounding it. However, she recovers and finds a new sense of purpose in uncovering the truth and seeking justice. This cycle repeats as she faces greater dangers and eventually finds a form of resolution and peace.\n\nThe story arc that best fits this pattern is the **Double Man in a Hole**, where the protagonist faces two cycles of dilemma and recovery. Lomito-Smith's journey involves falling into a hole (discovering the corruption and supernatural threat), recovering (uncovering the truth and finding a way to confront it), falling into another hole (facing direct danger from corrupt officers), and finally recovering (finding peace and justice).\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Arthur, a brilliant student who undergoes a significant transformation throughout the narrative. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Arthur's Debate Victory**: Arthur wins the National University Debate Championships, showcasing his intellectual prowess.\n2. **Discovery of the Letter**: Arthur finds an old letter from his late father, which sparks his interest in the indigenous village of Bison Hide Haven.\n3. **Arrival in Bison Hide Haven**: Arthur decides to leave his academic life behind and travels to Bison Hide Haven, where he is met with caution by the villagers.\n4. **Confrontation with Daren**: Arthur stands up to Daren, the local outlaw, and accepts a duel, marking a significant turning point in his journey.\n5. **The Sunset Showdown**: Arthur outdraws Daren in the sunset duel, earning the respect and acceptance of the villagers.\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1 (Arthur's Debate Victory)**: Arthur is in a state of outward success but feels an \"unsettling emptiness\" inside, indicating a lack of fulfillment despite his achievements.\n- **Event 2 (Discovery of the Letter)**: Arthur's state changes as he becomes intrigued by the story of Bison Hide Haven, showing a desire for something more meaningful than his current life. This marks a shift from emptiness to curiosity and a desire for change.\n- **Event 3 (Arrival in Bison Hide Haven)**: Upon arriving, Arthur is met with caution and is an outsider, indicating a drop in his social status from a respected student to a stranger in a new community. However, he is determined to learn and grow, showing resilience.\n- **Event 4 (Confrontation with Daren)**: Arthur's decision to stand up to Daren shows courage and a willingness to fight for what he believes in, marking a significant increase in his confidence and determination. This is a turning point where Arthur begins to assert himself and find his place.\n- **Event 5 (The Sunset Showdown)**: After outdrawing Daren, Arthur gains the respect and acceptance of the villagers, culminating in a higher state of social standing, personal fulfillment, and a sense of belonging. This event signifies Arthur's transformation from an outsider to a valued member of the community.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on Arthur's journey, the story arc can be classified by examining the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. Initially, Arthur is in a state of unfulfilled success, which can be considered a form of being in a \"hole\" due to his emotional and existential dissatisfaction. As the story progresses, he falls deeper into this hole by leaving behind the comforts and recognitions of his academic life, facing challenges and rejection in a new environment. However, through his determination, courage, and the lessons he learns, Arthur climbs out of this hole, ultimately achieving a higher state of fulfillment, respect, and belonging by the end of the story.\n\nThis pattern of falling into a dilemma (or a \"hole\") and then finding a way out to end up in a better condition aligns with the **Man in a Hole** story arc type. The key characteristic of this arc is the protagonist's journey from a lower state to a higher one, with significant challenges and growth along the way.\n\n### 4.

        "input": "Story, broken down into numbered sentences:\n1) In 1874, Will Andrews, the naive son of a pastor, has dropped out of Harvard and travels to Butcher's Crossing, a tiny frontier town in Kansas built on the buffalo hide trade.\n2) He wishes to see as much of the country as he can and experience the Wild West.\n3) Sold on the romanticism of going on a buffalo hunt, Will seeks out McDonald, a former acquaintance of his father's, who currently runs the waning buffalo trade for the town.\n4) When McDonald refuses to oblige the young man, Will falls in with Miller, an intense and experienced buffalo hunter who spins him a tale of a remote Colorado pass where one of the few remaining massive herds can be found.\n5) Though warned about Miller and the folly of this enterprise, Will puts up all of his money to fund the expedition.\n6) With Will's money, they purchase supplies and hire Charlie Hoge, a drunk, one armed, bible-thumper, to be wagon driver and camp cook, and Fred Schneider, a crude, but pragmatic, 'skinner' who insists on being paid a salary due to his doubts about Miller's stories.\n7) The journey to the pass is difficult for Will, who is thrilled and enchanted with the scenery, but unused to rigorous hardships.\n8) The team encounters many difficulties which make them doubt the veracity of Miller's claim and ability to lead them, and Will's sanity begins to falter, but eventually they reach the mountain pass to discover an untouched herd with thousands upon thousands of buffalo.\n9) Will is ecstatic and awed, believing the beautiful nature surrounding them is \"God\", elated at being able to experience something so beautiful.\n10) Miller begins his hunt.\n11) What starts as a thrilling adventure soon becomes an obsessive, methodical onslaught of endless slaughter.\n12) Miller revels in dropping hundreds of buffalo a day, leaving Will and Schneider scrambling to skin the carcasses, with Miller refusing to slow down his kills.\n13) The ceaseless rounds of blood and butchery wear on Will and his mental and physical health, as he begins to feel their presence is corrupting the sacred space of the pass.\n14) He becomes numb to the gore as time passes and the valley becomes filled with skinned corpses.\n15) After three weeks of constant butchery, Schneider points out that they have overstayed their intended time and already have more hides than they can carry.\n16) He proposes they stop and return before the weather turns and they become trapped.\n17) Miller refuses.\n18) He is obsessed and won't stop until every buffalo in the herd is dead.\n19) Will sides with Miller and the team stays to continue the slaughter despite Schneider's protests at the pointless waste of killing more than they can carry.\n20) Predictably, the team becomes trapped by a blizzard.\n21) They are now forced to live out the winter in the mountains.\n22) They are low on food, because they have killed all but a handful of the buffalo and left the previous carcasses to rot.\n23) Schneider is frustrated at becoming trapped because they wouldn't listen, and lashes out at Hoge, who has descended into paranoid religious mutterings.\n24) In revenge, Hoge poisons Schneider's food.\n25) Will's sanity slips further, and Miller obsesses over the triumph of returning to town with the largest haul ever seen once he's killed every single buffalo.\n26) The team settles in to endure a long, boring slog of survival as they wait the winter out.\n27) When spring comes, Hoge is killed after the poisoning is discovered, and the team is antsy to return.\n28) Unable to haul all of the 4,600 hides they have collected, they pile 1,600 in their wagon, and leave the remaining 3,000 with the intent to return for them.\n29) An exultant Miller is impatient to return to the town, triumphant with his haul, but their damaged wagon falls off a cliff, taking Scheider and the 1,600 hides with it, as Miller and Will numbly stare on.\n30) Will and Miller rush to town, hoping to get another wagon in order to return for the 3,000 remaining hides.\n31) But Butcher's Crossing is much changed.\n32) Largely abandoned and derelict, the pair are horrified to learn that the bottom has fallen out of the buffalo hide market while they were trapped for the winter.\n33) Had they returned the previous fall, as intended, instead of been greedy and stayed until every buffalo was killed, they could have sold their hides and become immensely wealthy.\n34) Now, with no buyers, the hides are completely worthless, and the town collapsed once its main source of commerce dried up.\n35) Robbed of his victory, Miller sets the old buffalo exchange building on fire.\n36) A much-changed Will says he has \"seen what [he] needed to see\" on the buffalo hunt when asked if the experience was worth it, and rides into the wilderness, alone.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better (e.g., 0→1→2→4→10)\n-

This pattern, where the protagonist rises to a peak (discovery of the buffalo herd and initial success) and then faces a drastic downfall (the slaughter's moral implications, the team's trap, and the market's collapse), aligns with the **Icarus** story arc type. The Icarus arc is characterized by a protagonist who starts low, rises to success, and then falls to a low point, which matches Will's journey from enthusiasm to disillusionment and financial loss.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Oliver, a young non-verbal autistic boy. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Oliver discovers the \"Misunderstood Monsters\" app and meets Larry** (sentences 4-6): This event introduces the supernatural element and marks the beginning of Oliver's interaction with Larry.\n2. **Oliver is bullied, and his phone is taken** (sentence 8): This event highlights Oliver's vulnerability and the challenges he faces due to his condition.\n3. **Larry appears and attacks one of the boys who bullied Oliver** (sentences 12-14): This event shows the consequences of Oliver's connection with Larry and how it affects those around him.\n4. **Sarah takes Larry's hand to save Oliver** (sentence 30): This event is a turning point where Oliver's mother sacrifices herself to protect him, changing Oliver's circumstances dramatically.\n5. **Oliver lives with Marty after Sarah's disappearance** (sentences 33-38): This final event shows the aftermath of Sarah's sacrifice and how Oliver's life has changed.\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Oliver's state is one of curiosity and possibly loneliness, given his interest in the \"Misunderstood Monsters\" app. His condition hasn't changed significantly from the beginning of the story, but this event sets the stage for future changes.\n- **Event 2**: Oliver's state worsens as he faces bullying and loses his primary means of communication. This event shows a decline in his well-being and safety.\n- **Event 3**: With Larry's appearance and attack, Oliver's state becomes more complex. While the bullies are punished, Oliver also becomes more entangled with the supernatural, which could be seen as both a form of protection and a source of danger. His condition is volatile and precarious.\n- **Event 4**: When Sarah takes Larry's hand, Oliver's state improves dramatically because he is saved from being taken by Larry. This act of sacrifice by his mother removes the immediate danger and shows a peak in Oliver's well-being, at least in terms of safety.\n- **Event 5**: After Sarah's disappearance, Oliver's state is one of loss and adjustment. He is now living with his father, and while there is an effort to rebuild and heal, the loss of his mother is a significant downfall. However, the final scene suggests a form of closure and hope, as Oliver sees his mother happy in another world.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the changes in Oliver's state throughout the story, we can observe that he starts in a vulnerable position, faces significant challenges and dangers, but then experiences a form of rescue and adjustment. His condition improves with his mother's sacrifice but then worsens again with her loss. However, the story ends on a hopeful note, suggesting that Oliver and those around him are finding ways to cope and possibly heal.\n\nThe story arc that best fits this pattern is the **Man in a Hole**. This arc is characterized by the protagonist falling into a dilemma and then finding a way out, often ending in a better state than where they began. While Oliver faces multiple challenges and the story takes a complex route, the overall trajectory from his initial vulnerability, through the dangers and losses, to the final scene of hope and adjustment, aligns with the **Man in a Hole** arc. The key aspect is the recovery and the eventual better state, despite the setbacks, which is evident in Oliver's ability to cope with his loss and find a new sense of security and hope.\n\n### 4.

The culmination of the story where Sarah takes over Morgan Industries, and Elaine is shown to be retired, reflecting on the future (sentences 23-26).\n\n### 2. Description of Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **Introduction of the HeartGuard**: At this point, Elaine is at the peak of her professional career, having created something revolutionary. Her personal life, however, is already showing signs of strain due to her preoccupation with work.\n\n2. **Sabotage of the HeartGuard**: This event marks a significant downfall for Elaine. Her professional reputation is shattered, and the credibility of her invention is undermined. This also reflects negatively on her personal life, as her relationship with her daughter continues to deteriorate.\n\n3. **Sarah's Heart Attack**: Elaine's state here is one of desperation and urgency. She is forced to use her unperfected device to save her daughter's life, which is a critical moment of truth for both her professional and personal life.\n\n4. **Dedication to Improving the HeartGuard and Reorganizing Life**: After saving Sarah's life, Elaine dedicates herself to securing the HeartGuard and to healing her relationship with her daughter. This marks a turning point where Elaine begins to balance her professional achievements with personal growth and connection.\n\n5. **Culmination of the Story**: By the end, Elaine has secured her legacy through her invention and has also repaired and strengthened her bond with her daughter. She is in a state of retirement, reflecting on the future, which suggests a sense of fulfillment and peace.\n\n### 3. Classification of Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc of Dr. Elaine Morgan follows a pattern where she rises to professional success, faces significant setbacks both professionally and personally, and then ultimately achieves a higher state of being through personal and professional redemption. \n\nInitially, Elaine is at a high point professionally but struggling personally. The sabotage of the HeartGuard and the strain in her relationship with Sarah represent significant downturns. However, the critical event of Sarah's heart attack and Elaine's subsequent actions to save her, improve the HeartGuard, and mend their relationship, mark a pivotal turn towards recovery and growth. \n\nBy the story's end, Elaine has not only redeemed her professional standing by securing the HeartGuard but has also achieved a profound personal victory by reconnecting with her daughter and ensuring her legacy. This trajectory—of rising, facing setbacks, and then ultimately achieving a higher state through overcoming those challenges—aligns with the **Cinderella** story arc type, which is characterized by a protagonist who faces adversity, overcomes it, and emerges in a better state than before.\n\n### 4.

he is consequently reliant on several specialized biomechanical devices, including a bed, a machine through which Caprice performs surgery on him, and a chair that twitches and rotates as it assists him with eating.\n9) Tenser and Caprice meet with bureaucrats in charge of the National Organ Registry, a governmental office designed to uphold the state's restrictions on human evolution by cataloging and storing newly evolved organs.\n10) One of the bureaucrats, the nervy Timlin, becomes captivated by Tenser's artistic goals.\n11) At a successful show of Tenser's, she tells him that \"surgery is the new sex\", a sentiment that Tenser and many other characters appear to embrace as repetitive cutting seems to be replacing traditional sex and masturbation as the preferred means of sexual gratification.\n12) A governmental police unit seeks to use Tenser to infiltrate a group of radical evolutionists.\n13) Without telling Caprice, Tenser meets a series of contacts through other biological performance art shows that lead him to the evolutionist cell.\n14) One of them, former cosmetic surgeon Nasatir, creates a zippered cavern in Tenser's stomach, which Caprice uses to access Tenser's organs in an oral sex act where she fellates his zipper wound and presumably his internal organs while he moans in erotic pleasure.\n15) Caprice continues to network with other performance artists, eventually choosing to receive decorative cosmetic surgery on her forehead.\n16) Tenser meets with Timlin, who reveals to him the agenda of the evolutionists: they have chosen to modify their digestive system to make them able to eat plastics and other synthetic chemicals.\n17) Their principal food is a purple processed \"candy bar\" of toxic waste, fatally poisonous to others.\n18) Lang is the leader of the cell; his son Brecken had been born with the ability to eat plastic, proving the inaccuracy of the government's critical stance on human evolution.\n19) Timlin tries to initiate sex with Tenser, but he says he is not good at \"the old sex\".\n20) Tenser is eventually approached by Lang, who wants Tenser and Caprice to reveal the cell's anti-government agenda through a public autopsy of Brecken that will highlight his evolved digestive system.\n21) After some deliberation, Tenser agrees.\n22) With Timlin, Lang, and many others watching, Tenser performs the autopsy, but it is revealed that Brecken's natural organ system has been surgically replaced.\n23) Lang flees the show in tears.\n24) Outside, he is approached by two agents who supposedly work for the corporation that manufactures Tenser's biomedical machines.\n25) Mimicking their earlier killing of Nasatir, they assassinate Lang by driving power drills into his head.\n26) Tenser's connection within the police unit admits that Timlin replaced Brecken's organs to keep the deviation in human evolution secret from the public.\n27) Saddened by Brecken and Lang's deaths, Tenser informs the police that he will no longer serve them, approvingly mentioning the cell's beliefs on evolution.\n28) Tenser struggles to eat in his chair.\n29) He asks Caprice to give him a bar of plastic.\n30) As Caprice records him, he eats it, looks into Caprice's camera, and sheds a tear.\n31) His mouth twitches into a smile as the chair finally quiets.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better (e.g., 0→1→2→4→10)\n- Riches to Rags: Protagonist starts high and ends lower (e.g., 10→9→8→6→0)\n- Man in a Hole: Protagonist falls into trouble but recovers (e.g., 6→2→1→4→10)\n- Icarus: Protagonist rises then falls dramatically (e.g., 2→4→9→5→1)\n- Double Man in a Hole: Two cycles of fall and recovery (e.g., 6→2→7→4→10)\n- Cinderella: Rise, setback, ultimate triumph (e.g., 1→7→4→1→10)\n- Oedipus: Start high, fall, recover, final fall (e.g., 10→4→7→9→1)",

Identify the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story can be identified as Saul Tenser, a performance artist with \"accelerated evolution syndrome.\" Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Tenser and Caprice meet with bureaucrats**: Tenser and Caprice discuss their artistic goals with the National Organ Registry.\n2. **Tenser agrees to infiltrate the evolutionist cell**: He decides to work with the government to infiltrate a group of radical evolutionists.\n3. **Tenser performs the autopsy of Brecken**: A public autopsy that reveals Brecken's natural organ system has been surgically replaced.\n4. **Lang is assassinated**: The leader of the evolutionist cell is killed by agents working for a corporation.\n5. **Tenser eats plastic and sheds a tear**: After learning the truth about Brecken and Lang's deaths, Tenser decides to eat plastic, symbolizing his acceptance of the evolutionists' beliefs.\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: Tenser is in a state of artistic expression and exploration, using his condition to create performance art.

Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the story. Initially, Tenser is in a unique but manageable situation (accelerated evolution syndrome), which could be considered a high point due to his success as a performance artist. However, as he becomes involved with the government and the evolutionist cell, his condition and emotional state fluctuate. The revelation of Brecken's altered body and Lang's assassination lead to a significant downfall in Tenser's emotional and possibly physical state. Finally, Tenser's decision to eat plastic could be seen as a recovery or a new beginning, but given the context, it's more about his acceptance of a new path rather than a return to a previous state.\n\nGiven the fluctuations in Tenser's condition, from a managed success, through betrayal and disillusionment, to a form of acceptance and new path, the story arc seems to follow a pattern of rise, fall, and then another significant change.\n\n### 4.

Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Charlie's state changes from comfortable to worried upon hearing about Rose's family estate. His concern for Rose and her family's situation sets him on a path of action.\n- **Event 2**: As the news spreads, Charlie's worry deepens, but he is also motivated by the community's outrage, potentially making him more determined to act.\n- **Event 3**: Charlie's decision to take matters into his own hands marks a significant shift from being reactive to proactive. His state changes from passive worry to active engagement.\n- **Event 4**: The unexpected twist introduces uncertainty and raises the stakes, potentially causing Charlie anxiety or doubt. However, this also tests his resolve and ability to adapt.\n- **Event 5**: Successfully achieving their goal, Charlie's state changes to one of triumph and relief. He not only solves the problem but also finds personal growth and possibly romantic fulfillment.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the progression of Charlie's state throughout the story, it's clear that he starts in a comfortable position, falls into a dilemma (upon learning about Rose's family estate and Deveraux's actions), and then finds a way out through his actions and the support of his friends. The story arc type that best fits this narrative is the **Man in a Hole** because Charlie initially faces a problem (the hole), then works his way out of it through determination and action, ending in a better state than where he began. This arc is characterized by a protagonist who faces a significant challenge, struggles through it, and emerges victorious and often personally transformed.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To classify the story arc type, let's follow the instructions step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the protagonist and 5 major events in the story:**\n   - The protagonist of the story is Blink, an aspiring artist.\n   - Five major events in the story are:\n     1. Hurricane Katrina decimates New Orleans (Event 2).\n     2. Blink and his friends are denied FEMA aid and consider a life of crime (Events 5 and 6).\n     3. The group decides to rob a casino (Event 7) and faces a shootout, leading to Andre's death (Event 9).\n     4. Blink and his friends attempt to navigate the criminal underworld, seeking help from The Saint and facing off against Lorenzo Bass (Events 17 and 31).\n     5. The final confrontation and resolution, where Blink survives a shootout and later publishes his graphic novel (Events 38 and 39).\n\n2. **Describe the protagonist's state and how it changed at each event:**\n   - **Event 1 (Hurricane Katrina):** Blink's life is severely disrupted by the hurricane, placing him in a difficult situation. His state changes from preparing for a wedding to dealing with the aftermath of a disaster.\n   - **Event 2 (Denied FEMA aid and considering crime):** Blink's situation worsens as he is denied aid and considers illegal activities to improve his situation. His state changes from seeking legal help to contemplating criminal acts.\n   - **Event 3 (Casino robbery and Andre's death):** Blink's decision to engage in crime leads to significant danger and loss, as his friend Andre is killed. His state changes from attempting to improve his situation through crime to facing the severe consequences of those actions.\n   - **Event 4 (Navigating the criminal underworld):** Blink and his friends face more dangers and challenges as they deal with criminal figures. His state remains precarious, with a constant threat of violence and legal repercussions.\n   - **Event 5 (Final confrontation and resolution):** Despite the risks, Blink survives and eventually publishes his graphic novel, achieving a long-held dream. His state changes from being embroiled in crime and danger to finding success and redemption through his art.\n\n3. **Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain the reasoning:**\n   - The story arc can be classified by examining how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the narrative. Initially, Blink faces significant challenges (Hurricane Katrina, denial of FEMA aid), which leads him to make risky decisions (engaging in criminal activity). He experiences a rise in his situation when he navigates the criminal underworld and eventually finds a way out through his art. However, this rise is preceded by a drastic fall into criminal activity and followed by a dangerous confrontation that could have ended in his death. The key characteristic of Blink's story is that he starts in a disadvantaged position, rises to a point of significant risk and challenge, faces a potential downfall, but ultimately ends in a better position than where he started, having found success and redemption.\n   - The story does not follow a simple **Rags to Riches** arc because Blink's path is marked by significant setbacks and dangers, including the death of a friend and his involvement in criminal activities. It's not **Riches to Rags** because Blink does not start in a high-status position. **Man in a Hole** could be considered because Blink falls into a dilemma (involvement in crime) and finds a way out (through his art), but this doesn't fully capture the complexity of his rise and fall. **Icarus** fits because Blink rises to a point of success (navigating the criminal underworld and eventually publishing his novel) but faces a drastic downfall (the dangerous confrontations and the death of his friends), and while he ends in a better state, the journey is marked by significant risks and challenges. **Double Man in a Hole** and **Cinderella** do not perfectly fit because Blink's story does not involve two clear cycles of dilemma and recovery or a simple rise, setback, and ultimate achievement without the deep involvement in criminal activity and its consequences. **Oedipus** also does not fit because Blink does not start in a high position and then fall; instead, he starts low and faces challenges as he rises.\n\n4. **Determined story arc type:**\nIcarus"

narratives.\n3) Jane quickly grows a strong following of passionate viewers ranging from every corner of the world, drawn in by her trademark smile, her thoughtful authenticity, and her avant-garde utilization of real-time comments and fan-instigated song suggestions, which she ingeniously incorporates into her evolving compositions.\n4) However, an ominous unseen entity with malevolent intentions latches onto her progressively popular webcast.\n5) Unbeknownst to Jane and her growing audience, this malevolent force uses her vibrant music stream as a bridge from the otherworldly to our reality, nesting within the limitless labyrinth of the Internet.\n6) Soon enough, as Jane's fanbase swells and her online persona becomes a musical sensation, she starts receiving odd comments during her audience-interaction live-chat sessions.\n7) These peculiar messages, disguised as intricate riddles and perplexing puzzles, begin to shape her performances in unforeseen ways.\n8) Among these mysterious messages often comes from an eerie user named 'Diabolic12', a user whose cryptic influence starts steering her exuberant melodies to take on a darker, more ominous tone.\n9) Jane, immersed in her artistic process, is none the wiser to the subtle manipulation of her music.\n10) Simultaneously, the fans who downloaded Jane's chillingly transformed compositions begin to experience hair-raising incidents.\n11) Screens spontaneously flicker, phones crash without explanation, and several even feel an unseen chilling touch against their skin, turning their comfortable living spaces into a house of haunts.\n12) As the unsettling incidents grow more frequent, Jane herself becomes a target.\n13) She begins to question her sanity as she experiences terrifying hallucinations involving menacing figures and hushed shadowy whispers, driving a wedge into her previously joyous creative process.\n14) Driven by the eerie happenings surrounding her music and urged by her innate curiosity, Jane embarks on a tireless investigation into this bizarre phenomenon.\n15) She dedicates long, nocturnal hours in the dimly lit local library, unearthing dusty old folklore that points towards something unnerving.\n16) Jane comes across an ancient legend about a banished demon by the name of Zephyros, yearning to return to the mortal realm, following millennium-long banishment.\n17) The chill down her spine deepens as she realizes that her music webcast seems to be the digital bridge Zephyros exploited to infiltrate into the human world.\n18) Every piano riff that Jane tenderly develops, and every lyric she pours her heart into, unknowingly serves as an eerie chant in this digital era, further bolstering Zephyros's power in the earthly realm.\n19) The revelation forces Jane to make a difficult decision: to abandon her passion or continue, risking her followers.\n20) It takes days of agonizing deliberation for Jane to arrive at a decision.\n21) Despite her profound sadness at the prospect of discontinuing her webcast, she resolves to confront the situation head-on.\n22) Damning the risks, she uses her platform to alert her audience about the looming threat of Zephyros.\n23) Her dedicated viewers, realizing the severity of the situation, begin getting creative.\n24) They combine their collective wisdom, pool resources, and strategize on ways to combat Zephyros.\n25) Zephyros cruelly morphs Jane’s inspiring melodies into abhorrent soundscapes that reverberate like tortured wails from damned souls, using distortions, screams, and excessive reverb to corrupt her music.\n26) Yet, Jane and her viewers remain resolute, united in their determination.\n27) They resolve to use Zephyros’ own influence against it by integrating the demon's haunting incantations into their original musical compositions.\n28) Their aim is to dilute its power by distorting the very incantations the demon relies on, in the hope of sending it back where it belongs.\n29) As the noble struggle intensifies, Jane's platform becomes the battleground for an unprecedented confrontation of sound and will, as they pit their unity and resolve against the horrifying might of Zephyrosism.\n30) The viewers attempt to counterbalance the gruesome melodies of Zephyros with a powerful composition of their own – a beautiful sonic tapestry imbued with courage, hope, and an unyielding determination to reclaim control over their lives from the encroaching demon.\n31) The collective composition, filled with sheer survival instinct and a defiant spirit, eventually dwindles the malevolent influence of Zephyros, creating an impenetrable force-field against the demon’s intrusion.\n32) Defeated and trapped in its digital prison once more, Zephyros is unable to harness Jane's melodic compositions for its benefit any longer.\n33) A visibly depleted but unbowed Jane re-emerges on her platform, reassuring her viewers that despite the harrowing ordeal, her spirit remains unbroken.\n34) Jane earnestly pledges to continue her exploration of music, promising an added focus on supernatural safety rules to safeguard her audience.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n-

Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Jane is in a state of discovery and growth, finding success and joy in her webcast. Her condition is improving as she gains a following and engages with her fans.\n- **Event 2**: Jane's state becomes potentially compromised, though she is unaware of the malevolent entity's influence. Her condition hasn't changed in her perception, but there's an external factor now affecting her webcast.\n- **Event 3**: Jane's state begins to deteriorate as she experiences terrifying hallucinations and her music takes on a darker tone. Her condition worsens due to the influence of the malevolent entity.\n- **Event 4**: Jane's state is one of investigation and realization.

Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Annie flies to London):** Annie is escaping the challenges of her life in Los Angeles, such as pandemic restrictions and homelessness, indicating a desire for change and possibly a low point in her life due to these frustrations.\n- **Event 2 (Annie steals Stretch’s car):** Annie's actions lead to more conflict and chaos, indicating a further decline in her situation as she engages in risky behavior and potentially damages her friendship with Stretch.\n- **Event 3 (Discovery about Angela):** Annie and Stretch are in a precarious and mysterious situation, indicating a state of uncertainty and danger. This event marks a point where Annie's condition could be seen as hitting a low due to the escalating strange and threatening circumstances.\n- **Event 4 (Angela kills Stretch):** This event represents a significant low point for Annie, as she loses her friend and is left alone to face the dangers that Angela poses. This is emotionally and situationally a deep hole for Annie.\n- **Event 5 (Annie kills Angela and the creature):** Annie emerges victorious but not without scars, both physically and emotionally. She has navigated through a series of dangerous and bizarre events, coming out on top but forever changed by her experiences.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the progression of Annie's condition throughout the story, it starts with her seeking escape from her frustrations, then plummeting into a series of dangerous and bizarre events, hitting a low point with the death of her friend, and finally emerging victorious but changed. This pattern suggests that Annie falls into a dilemma (flying to London and getting entangled in the mysterious events surrounding Angela) and finds a way out, ending in a better state than when she was at her lowest (having overcome the supernatural threats). However, the story's complexity, with its multiple layers of conflict and recovery, suggests a more nuanced arc than a simple \"Man in a Hole\" might imply. Yet, the core element of falling into a hole (the series of escalating dangers and mysteries) and then finding a way out (overcoming Angela and the creature) aligns with this arc type.\n\n### 4.

Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. Joey is forced to rob a remote home and they encounter a security guard, leading to the guard falling into an abandoned well (Sentences 1-2).\n2. Joey decides to visit the trapped guard, Hamby (later revealed to be Randy), and provide him with necessities, feeling guilty about leaving him trapped (Sentence 4).\n3. Matt discovers Joey's actions and tries to kill Hamby by dropping a pesticide canister into the well, revealing the depths of Matt's cruelty (Sentence 6).\n4. Joey learns the truth about the man in the well, Randy, and decides to help him escape in exchange for help in punishing Matt (Sentences 11-14).\n5. The final confrontation where Randy is killed by Carol, and Matt and Joey are reunited after a violent ordeal (Sentences 25-29).\n\n### 2.

Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the story. Given that Joey starts in a disadvantaged situation (being forced into crime), faces various dilemmas and challenges (guilt over leaving the guard, dealing with Matt's cruelty, allying with a fugitive), and ultimately ends in a better state (reconciled with his brother, safe, and having played a part in resolving the conflict), the story follows a specific pattern.\n\nJoey's journey is characterized by a fall into a dilemma (the initial robbery and its consequences) and a subsequent rise as he navigates through the challenges, makes difficult choices, and eventually finds a way out of his troubles, ending in a more positive state than where he started.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Jamie New, a 16-year-old gay boy who dreams of being a drag queen. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. Jamie's 16th birthday party, where his father fails to show up, and he receives a pair of expensive red high heels from his mother.\n2. Jamie's decision to perform as a drag queen at the local club, with the help of Hugo Battersby, the owner of the drag shop House of Loco.\n3. Jamie's performance as Mimi Me at the drag show, where he faces initial heckling but ultimately succeeds and gains confidence.\n4. Jamie's confrontation with his father, where he learns the truth about his father's disinterest and disappointment in him.\n5. The prom night, where Jamie decides to attend as himself, wearing a traditional girls' prom dress, and faces initial rejection from Hedge but is eventually supported by his classmates.\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1:** Jamie's state is one of disappointment and unfulfilled expectations due to his father's absence. However, he also experiences joy and support from his mother, symbolized by the gift of the high heels. His state is hopeful but tinged with sadness.\n- **Event 2:** Jamie's state evolves to one of determination and aspiration as he decides to pursue his dream of being a drag queen. With Hugo's mentorship, Jamie feels supported and encouraged, marking an improvement in his state from mere hope to active pursuit of his dreams.\n- **Event 3:** At the drag show, Jamie initially faces anxiety and fear of rejection. However, after successfully performing as Mimi Me, his state shifts to one of triumph and heightened confidence. This event marks a significant peak in Jamie's journey, where he overcomes his fears and gains acceptance and applause.\n- **Event 4:** The confrontation with his father leads to a downturn in Jamie's state. He experiences shock, hurt, and betrayal upon learning the truth about his father's feelings. This event marks a low point in Jamie's journey, where his sense of identity and self-worth is challenged.\n- **Event 5:** On prom night, Jamie's state reflects a mix of resilience, self-acceptance, and the desire for genuine connection. By choosing to attend as himself and facing the potential for rejection, Jamie demonstrates growth and a stronger sense of self. The support he eventually receives from his classmates further improves his state, ending on a note of acceptance and belonging.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc of Jamie New can be classified by analyzing the trajectory of his condition throughout the narrative. Initially, Jamie faces disappointment and unfulfilled expectations, marking a low point. As he pursues his dreams and finds support, his condition improves, leading to a peak of confidence and success at the drag show. However, this is followed by a significant downturn when he confronts the harsh reality of his father's feelings, marking another low point. Finally, Jamie recovers and grows, ending in a higher state of self-acceptance and social acceptance at the prom.\n\nThis pattern of rising to a peak, facing a setback, and ultimately achieving a higher state aligns with the **Cinderella** story arc type. The Cinderella arc is characterized by the protagonist's journey from a lowly state, through a series of challenges and setbacks, to a ultimately higher state of success and recognition. Jamie's story follows this arc, as he moves from feeling marginalized and unsupported, through the challenge of pursuing his dream and facing rejection, to finally finding acceptance and confidence in himself.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Pili, a Native Hawaiian sibling who moves to Oʻahu with her family. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. Pili wins a geocaching competition but has to relocate to Oʻahu instead of attending a summer camp (sentences 2-3).\n2. Pili discovers an old diary in her grandfather's art studio, which sparks her interest in finding a lost pirate treasure (sentence 4).\n3. Pili and her friends (including Casper, E, and Hana) embark on a treasure hunt, following the clues in the diary (sentences 17-20).\n4. The group faces various obstacles, including a cave, a lava-filled crevice, and a tunnel filled with rainwater, but eventually finds the treasure (sentences 20-28).\n5. The group realizes the treasure is an offering and awakens the Night Watchers, leading to a dramatic escape and a resolution where Pili's family decides to stay in Hawaiʻi (sentences 32-42).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: Pili is initially excited about the geocaching competition but then feels malaise due to the relocation. Her state is one of disappointment and adjustment to a new environment.\n- **Event 2**: Pili's discovery of the diary improves her state, as it gives her a new focus and excitement about the potential treasure hunt. Her condition improves from feeling down about leaving New York.\n- **Event 3**: As Pili begins the treasure hunt with her friends, her state is one of adventure and anticipation. This is an improvement from the initial adjustment struggles in Oʻahu.\n- **Event 4**: During the treasure hunt, Pili faces challenges and dangers, which could be seen as a downturn in her state due to the risks involved. However, the excitement and progress in the hunt likely keep her state elevated compared to the initial relocation blues.\n- **Event 5**: After awakening the Night Watchers and the subsequent escape, Pili's state could be seen as fearful or stressed. However, the resolution where her family decides to stay in Hawaiʻi and the emotional moment with her father's spirit suggests an overall positive outcome for Pili, improving her state from the initial displacement and adjustment issues.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story can be classified based on how Pili's condition changes throughout the narrative. Initially, Pili is in a state of disappointment and adjustment (low point). She then finds a new passion and excitement with the diary and the treasure hunt (improvement), faces challenges during the hunt (downturn), and finally reaches a resolution where she and her family find a new sense of belonging and closure (high point). This pattern suggests that Pili falls into a dilemma (the move and initial adjustment) and then finds a way out that ends with her in a better state than at the beginning.\n\nGiven this analysis, the story arc type that best fits Pili's journey is one where the protagonist faces a challenge, overcomes it, and ends in a better state than where they started, which aligns with the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc. However, considering the specific classification provided and the detailed progression of Pili's state through multiple cycles of challenge and recovery (initial move, finding the diary, the treasure hunt challenges, and the final resolution), it might more specifically fit into a pattern of facing two significant cycles of dilemma and recovery.\n\n### 4.

Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story follows a pattern where the protagonist (Jose) starts in a disadvantaged situation, faces significant challenges and setbacks, but ultimately achieves a better life. The story arc involves Jose rising to improve his family's life, facing a major setback (the threat of deportation), and then overcoming this challenge to achieve a higher state of well-being and security (permanent residency in the U.S.).\n\nThis pattern aligns with the **Cinderella** story arc type, where the protagonist rises, faces a setback, and ultimately achieves a higher state. The key elements are the initial disadvantaged position, the rise (Jose's initial successes in the U.S.), the setback (threat of deportation), and the ultimate triumph (gaining permanent residency).\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is James Foster, a novelist. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **The Accident**: James accidentally hits and kills a local man while driving under the influence (sentence 6).\n2. **The Introduction to Li Tolqa's Justice System**: James learns about and utilizes the unique justice system of Li Tolqa, where he can pay to have a clone of himself executed in his place (sentence 9).\n3. **The Transformation**: James is encouraged by Gabi and her group to transform into a libertine criminal, engaging in various heinous activities (sentence 17).\n4. **The Moment of Clarity and Panic**: James has a moment of clarity, realizes his situation, and attempts to flee (sentence 19).\n5. **The Final Confrontation and Transformation**: James is forced to kill a clone of himself, marking a complete transformation into the kind of person Gabi's group wanted him to become (sentence 26 and 27).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **At the beginning**: James is in a state of marital strife but is financially secure, having married into money.\n- **After the accident (Event 1)**: James's state worsens significantly as he faces the threat of death. However, he manages to escape this fate by paying for a clone to be executed in his place, slightly improving his situation but morally complicating it.\n- **Introduction to Li Tolqa's justice system (Event 2)**: This event initially improves James's condition, as he avoids death. However, it sets the stage for his further descent into moral and ethical compromise.\n- **The transformation (Event 3)**: James's state deteriorates as he engages in criminal and perverse activities, losing his moral bearings and becoming more entrenched in the group's lifestyle.\n- **The moment of clarity and panic (Event 4)**: For a brief moment, James attempts to regain control of his life and escape the situation, indicating a desire to improve his condition. However, this attempt fails, and he is pulled back into the group's influence.\n- **The final confrontation and transformation (Event 5)**: James's state reaches a new low as he is forced to commit a horrific act, symbolizing his complete transformation into a criminal devoid of his previous moral identity.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story follows James from a position of relative comfort and security into a deep moral and ethical downfall, punctuated by moments of attempted escape and recovery, only to end in a state of significant degradation and trauma. This pattern, where the protagonist starts in a high state, falls into a dilemma, attempts to recover or escape, but ultimately faces another significant downfall, aligns with the **Oedipus** story arc type. The Oedipus arc is characterized by a protagonist who begins in a position of power or happiness, suffers a reversal of fortune, and then, despite any attempts to recover, ends in a worse state than where they began.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Maya. Here are 5 major events in the story:\n\n1. **Event 1**: Maya tries to wake the hive to announce the arrival of spring, but the others go back to sleep (Sentence 1).\n2. **Event 2**: Maya and Willy are threatened with separation due to their partnership being seen as calamitous (Sentence 3).\n3. **Event 3**: Maya and Willy embark on a mission to return the golden orb (Smoosh, the ant princess) to Bonsai Peak, facing various challenges (Sentences 5-16).\n4. **Event 4**: Maya and Willy are trapped in a dark cave by Bumbulus, Henchie, and Boof, feeling they have failed their mission (Sentence 24).\n5. **Event 5**: Maya and Willy are rescued, and they successfully save Bonsai Peak and return to the hive, where they are congratulated and allowed to stay together (Sentences 25-32).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Maya is full of joy and enthusiasm, trying to share the news of spring's arrival. Her state is positive and energetic.\n- **Event 2**: Maya's state changes to one of concern and determination as she learns she and Willy might be separated. This introduces a challenge and a potential downfall.\n- **Event 3**: As Maya and Willy take on the mission, Maya's state becomes one of adventure and responsibility. Despite facing challenges, she shows resilience and determination, indicating an improvement or a rise in her condition as she works towards a goal.\n- **Event 4**: Being trapped and feeling they have failed represents a low point for Maya, a significant setback where her condition worsens.\n- **Event 5**: With the successful rescue and completion of their mission, Maya's state improves dramatically. She achieves a higher state than at the beginning, having saved Bonsai Peak, ensured she and Willy can stay together, and earned recognition.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the changes in Maya's state throughout the story, we observe a pattern where she starts in a positive state, faces a potential downfall (threat of separation), rises as she takes on a challenge (the mission to save Smoosh), faces a significant setback (being trapped), and ultimately achieves a higher state than at the beginning (successful completion of the mission and recognition). This pattern aligns with the **Cinderella** story arc type, where the protagonist rises, faces a setback, and ultimately achieves a higher state. The key elements here are the initial positive state, the introduction of a challenge or potential downfall, the proactive efforts to overcome this challenge, a significant setback, and finally, a triumphant conclusion that surpasses the initial state.\n\n### 4.

Everyman discovers the plot of an impending heinous crime and urgently appeals to his superiors, only to be met with dismissal (sentence 15).\n5. Everyman and his team successfully thwart a disastrous train bombing in downtown Washington D.C. (sentence 22).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **Event 1 (Proposal):** Everyman is in a state of professional eagerness and determination. His condition is one of optimism and ambition, seeking to make a name for himself in the NIA.\n\n2. **Event 2 (Noticing Unsettling Tendencies):** Everyman's state begins to shift towards unease and intrigue. He is more invested in the case but also starts to experience the psychological strain of dealing with a manipulative and dangerous individual like Carter.\n\n3. **Event 3 (Deciphering Signals):** Everyman's condition improves in terms of his professional progress, as he makes significant breakthroughs in understanding Carter. However, this success comes at the cost of his personal life and professional standing, indicating a mixed state of achievement and strain.\n\n4. **Event 4 (Discovery and Dismissal):** Everyman's state deteriorates as he faces dismissal and disbelief from his superiors. This rejection, despite his crucial findings, places him in a professionally vulnerable and personally desperate situation.\n\n5. **Event 5 (Thwarting the Crime):** Everyman's condition peaks as he achieves a major success, saving countless lives. However, this victory is short-lived due to Carter's death, which leaves Everyman with a mix of relief, grief, and the burden of unresolved mysteries.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be determined by analyzing the protagonist's condition throughout the major events. Initially, Everyman is in a relatively low state of professional standing but high in ambition (Event 1). As the story progresses, he rises to make significant discoveries and eventually prevents a major crime, reaching a peak (Event 5). However, his success is followed by a downfall in the form of Carter's death, leaving him with unresolved questions and a new, unintended role (Event 5 aftermath). This pattern of rising to success and then facing a drastic downfall aligns with the **Icarus** story arc type. In an Icarus story arc, the protagonist starts low, rises to a peak, and then falls to a low point again. Everyman's journey from an ambitious but inexperienced agent to a successful crime preventer, and then to a state of mixed victory and new, daunting responsibilities, reflects this pattern.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\n\nThe protagonist in the story is Bill Hagmaier, an FBI agent who interacts closely with Ted Bundy, a death row inmate.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. Bill's initial meeting with Ted Bundy (sentences 2-3), where they start to establish a relationship based on trust and the examination of factors that might contribute to serial killing behavior.\n2. The moment when Ted senses Bill getting too deep into his mind and decides to taunt him, leading to Bill accurately describing what Ted would do if he escaped (sentence 14), marking a significant point in their psychological interaction.\n3. Ted's revelation that he and Bill could easily change places, which deeply affects Bill (sentence 16), indicating a profound psychological impact on Bill.\n4. The confession of Ted's crimes to Bill, where he admits to 30 deaths (sentence 24), showing a peak in their interaction where Ted opens up significantly to Bill.\n5. The final interaction before Ted's execution, where Bill asks to be taken \"under the water\" and Ted shares harsh details of how he lured and killed a victim (sentence 32), leaving Bill overwhelmed and in tears, marking a significant emotional and psychological turning point for Bill.\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- At the first event, Bill is cautious but engaged, trying to understand Ted Bundy. His state is one of professional curiosity and caution.\n- By the second event, Bill has become more psychologically invested in understanding Ted, showing a deeper level of engagement and trust. His state has shifted to one of heightened emotional and psychological involvement.\n- The third event marks a significant psychological impact on Bill, as he is forced to confront the possibility that he and Ted are not so different. This revelation likely leaves Bill questioning his own nature and morality, placing him in a state of introspection and possibly turmoil.\n- At the fourth event, Bill's state is one of intense focus and determination to understand Ted, as evidenced by Ted's willingness to confess his crimes to him. Bill is deeply involved in the case, both professionally and personally.\n- The fifth event shows Bill in a state of emotional overwhelm and possibly horror at the details of Ted's crimes. He is visibly affected, to the point of tears, indicating a profound emotional and psychological impact.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc can be classified based on the protagonist's (Bill Hagmaier) condition throughout the narrative. Initially, Bill is in a professional and cautious state. As the story progresses, he becomes more emotionally and psychologically invested in his interactions with Ted Bundy, facing moments of deep psychological insight and turmoil. However, he also experiences moments of profound emotional impact, particularly towards the end of the story. \n\nGiven this progression, Bill's condition starts at a point of professional engagement, descends into deeper psychological and emotional turmoil as he delves deeper into Ted's psyche and confronts the darkness within himself, and ends in a state of emotional overwhelm but also a form of resolution or acceptance of the depths of human depravity he has witnessed.\n\nThis pattern suggests a narrative where the protagonist faces challenges and descends into a form of psychological or emotional \"hole\" but ultimately finds a way to cope or come to terms with his experiences by the end of the story. Thus, the story arc that best fits this description is the \"Man in a Hole,\" where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (in this case, psychological and emotional turmoil) and finds a way out, ending in a better or more resolved state than when he entered the dilemma.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To analyze the story arc of the given narrative, let's follow the instructions step by step.\n\n### 1. Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\n\n- **Protagonist:** The protagonist of the story is Jack Mancini.\n- **5 Major Events:**\n  1. The planning and decision to target Stuart Hawke's wealth (sentences 3-6).\n  2. Jack's internal conflict and his attraction to Alison, Hawke's daughter (sentences 12-13).\n  3. The confrontation with Hawke and the chaos that ensues, leading to Jack prioritizing Alison's safety (sentences 15-17).\n  4. Jack's decision to play a double agent to protect Alison and her family (sentences 24-25).\n  5. The final confrontation and resolution, where Jack helps bring down his former allies and finds redemption (sentences 32-35).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Planning to target Hawke):** Jack is in a state of criminal intent, looking to escape his past through illegal means. His condition is one of moral compromise and risk.\n- **Event 2 (Attraction to Alison):** Jack experiences an internal conflict, torn between his loyalty to his criminal brethren and his growing feelings for Alison, which symbolize a desire for a different, cleaner life. His condition becomes more emotionally complex and morally questioning.\n- **Event 3 (Confrontation with Hawke):** Jack's actions lead to chaos, but he chooses to prioritize Alison's safety, indicating a shift towards redemption and a desire to protect the innocent. His condition improves morally but worsens in terms of immediate danger and consequences.\n- **Event 4 (Decision to play a double agent):** Jack is in a state of high risk and moral dilemma, choosing to deceive his allies to protect others. This decision shows his commitment to leaving his criminal past behind and seeking a path to redemption. His condition is tense and precarious.\n- **Event 5 (Final confrontation and resolution):** Jack achieves a form of redemption by helping to bring down his former allies and ensuring the safety of Alison and her family. Despite being imprisoned, he finds a sense of peace and hope for a better future. His condition improves significantly, both morally and in terms of personal growth.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the protagonist's journey, we observe that Jack starts in a disadvantaged situation (a life of crime), falls into a deeper dilemma (internal conflict and risky actions), and then finds a way out through his decisions and actions, ending in a better state (redemption and hope for the future). This pattern fits the **Man in a Hole** story arc, where the protagonist faces a significant problem, hits a low point, and then recovers to a better state than where they started. However, considering the complexity of Jack's journey, which involves not just one but multiple cycles of dilemma and recovery (his initial criminal life, his internal conflict over Alison, his decision to betray his allies, and his final redemption), it could also be argued that the story follows a **Double Man in a Hole** pattern, given the multiple lows and recoveries.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Curt Goynes, a gangster in need of cash. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Event 1: Recruitment** - Curt Goynes is recruited for a blackmail scheme (sentence 1).\n2. **Event 2: The Hostage Situation** - Goynes, along with others, holds a family hostage as part of the scheme, leading to the death of Charley (sentences 2-4).\n3. **Event 3: The Discovery of the Fake Documents** - Jones discovers the documents retrieved by Wertz are fake, leading to a new set of instructions for Goynes (sentences 5-6).\n4. **Event 4: The Retrieval of the Real Document** - Goynes, Russo, and Wertz retrieve the real document, which turns out to be plans for a new car part (sentence 9).\n5. **Event 5: The Final Resolution** - Goynes resolves his situation with Watkins, receiving the $5,000 he originally sought and leaving for Kansas City (sentences 30-31).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **At Event 1 (Recruitment):** Goynes is in a disadvantaged situation, needing cash to leave town. His condition is low.\n- **At Event 2 (The Hostage Situation):** Goynes's condition improves slightly as he takes control by killing Charley and protecting the family, showing a moral compass and initiative.\n- **At Event 3 (The Discovery of the Fake Documents):** Goynes's condition worsens as he is ordered to kill Russo and the family, realizing he and Russo have been set up. This is a significant downturn.\n- **At Event 4 (The Retrieval of the Real Document):** Goynes's condition improves as he successfully retrieves the document and starts making plans to sell it, potentially gaining financially and resolving his initial need for cash.\n- **At Event 5 (The Final Resolution):** Goynes's condition ends on a high note relative to his starting point. He resolves his conflicts, receives the money he initially sought, and is able to leave for Kansas City, achieving a form of freedom and resolution to his initial problem.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the story. Given the fluctuations in Goynes's situation, from a low point of needing cash and being in dangerous situations, to moments of control and initiative, and finally to resolving his situation and achieving a form of success and freedom, the story exhibits characteristics of a \"Double Man in a Hole\" arc. This is because Goynes faces at least two significant cycles of dilemma (being in a bad situation) and recovery (improving his situation). The first cycle involves the initial recruitment and the complications arising from the hostage situation and the discovery of the fake documents. The second cycle involves the retrieval of the real document and the subsequent negotiations and dangers associated with selling it, culminating in his final resolution with Watkins and his departure.\n\nThe \"Double Man in a Hole\" arc fits because Goynes's story involves more than one significant downturn (being set up, facing danger) followed by recovery (resolving the situation, achieving financial gain, and personal resolution). This pattern of falling into a dilemma and then finding a way out, repeated over the course of the story, aligns with the characteristics of the \"Double Man in a Hole\" story arc.\n\n### 4.

This pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (captivity and false accusations) and then finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning.

The attempt by Yulian's team to capture Hutch, leading to his temporary capture and subsequent escape (sentences 22-24).\n5. The final confrontation where Hutch, along with his brother and father, defeats Yulian and his men (sentence 37).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1 (Burglary):** Initially, Hutch is portrayed as living a mundane life, feeling emasculated by his inability to defend his home. His state is one of emotional and psychological vulnerability.\n- **Event 2 (Confrontation with Thieves):** Hutch's attempt to retrieve his daughter's bracelet shows a proactive side, but his frustration upon not finding it leaves him in a state of heightened emotional distress. His condition has slightly worsened as he feels more helpless.\n- **Event 3 (Fight on the Bus):** This event marks a significant turning point. Hutch's actions demonstrate his hidden past and capabilities, improving his self-esteem and confidence. His condition has begun to improve as he starts to break free from his mundane, emasculated persona.\n- **Event 4 (Capture and Escape):** Despite being captured, Hutch's resourcefulness allows him to escape, further solidifying his confidence and showcasing his survival skills. His condition continues to improve as he regains control over his life and starts to confront his past directly.\n- **Event 5 (Final Confrontation):** In the final confrontation, Hutch, with the help of his family, defeats the antagonists, securing his family's safety and finding a path towards redemption and peace. His condition has significantly improved from the initial state, as he has overcome his emotional and psychological vulnerabilities, reclaimed his identity, and found a way to balance his past and present life.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the analysis, the story follows a narrative where the protagonist starts in a disadvantaged or vulnerable state, faces challenges and setbacks, but ultimately rises to overcome these challenges, ending in a better state than where he began. This pattern aligns with the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (in this case, his emasculated state and the danger posed by the Russian crime lord) and then finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning.\n\nThe key characteristic of the \"Man in a Hole\" arc is the protagonist's journey from a low point to a higher point, which is evident in Hutch's transformation from a seemingly ordinary, emotionally estranged man to someone who confronts his past, protects his family, and finds redemption.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\nThe protagonist of the story can be considered as Erika, given that the narrative extensively explores her actions, thoughts, and the impact she has on other characters, particularly Alex. However, the story's focus shifts significantly towards Alex as it progresses, making him a co-protagonist or even the main protagonist in the latter half. For the purpose of this analysis, we'll consider Alex as the protagonist because the story's resolution and the character's emotional journey are more closely tied to him.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. **Erika's Escape**: Erika murders Hugo and then manipulates Alex into giving her a ride, marking the beginning of her escape plan (sentences 6-10).\n2. **Forming a Bond**: Erika and Alex form a unique bond over art, leading to Alex inviting her to stay with him (sentences 12-14).\n3. **Discovery of Erika's Past**: Alex discovers Erika's true nature and her involvement in the murder at the asylum, marking a significant turn in their relationship (sentence 18).\n4. **Psychological Warfare**: Alex uses his therapy skills to manage Erika's behavior, engaging in a form of psychological warfare to protect his family (sentences 23-26).\n5. **The Final Confrontation**: Alex outsmarts Erika, traps her in her own psyche, and arranges for her apprehension by the police (sentences 27-31).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n- **At Event 1 (Erika's Escape)**: Alex is oblivious to the danger Erika poses. His state is one of kindness and professionalism, unaware of the threat that has just entered his life.\n- **At Event 2 (Forming a Bond)**: Alex's state improves as he forms a connection with Erika, seeing her as a resilient individual who could benefit from his help. He is hopeful and empathetic.\n- **At Event 3 (Discovery of Erika's Past)**: Alex's state worsens significantly as he discovers the truth about Erika. He moves from a state of trust and empathy to one of fear and dread for his family's safety.\n- **At Event 4 (Psychological Warfare)**: Alex's state is one of strategic engagement, using his skills to counter Erika's manipulations. He is proactive and determined to protect his family, indicating a level of control and agency.\n- **At Event 5 (The Final Confrontation)**: Alex's state improves as he successfully outsmarts Erika and ensures her capture. However, the experience leaves him with a lingering sense of unease and a tainted trust in humanity.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\nGiven the progression of Alex's state throughout the story, we can observe that he initially is in a positive state (oblivious but safe), then improves further (forming a bond), followed by a significant downturn (discovery of Erika's past), then regains control (psychological warfare), and finally ends in a better state than his lowest point but not without scars (the final confrontation). This pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist faces a dilemma, finds a way out, and ends better than at the beginning, but with a lasting impact from the experience.\n\n### 4.

        "input": "Story, broken down into numbered sentences:\n1) In January 2007, Estonian psychiatric patient Leena Klammer, a 31-year-old woman with a rare hormonal disorder called hypopituitarism that gives her the appearance of a 9-year-old child, orchestrates an escape from the Saarne Institute by seducing and killing a guard and hiding in the car of an art therapist named Anna.\n2) After breaking into Anna's house and killing her, Leena looks up missing American girls and finds that she bears a striking resemblance to Esther Albright, a girl from a rich family who went missing in 2003.\n3) Later, posing as a lost girl, Leena is approached by a Russian police officer and introduces herself as \"Esther\", claiming that her parents are in the United States.\n4) In Darien, Connecticut, wealthy artist Allen Albright and his wife Tricia, who has since come to terms with the disappearance of their daughter, are informed by Detective Donnan that \"Esther\" has been found.\n5) Tricia travels to the U.S. embassy in Moscow where she is \"reunited\" with Esther.\n6) Tricia brings Esther home and immediately starts to have doubts when she notices that Esther has forgotten about the death of her grandmother or that her painting skills have increased enormously compared to before she disappeared.\n7) Leena falls in love with Allen after they both start bonding over their painting skills, and tries to separate him from Tricia.\n8) While Tricia and Allen attend a charity gala hosted by Tricia, Donnan arrives at the house and steals a vinyl record from Esther's room which has Leena's fingerprints on it.\n9) He takes it back to his house, unaware that Leena has followed him, and analyzes the fingerprints to find it is not a match.\n10) Leena attacks Donnan and stabs him with a knife repeatedly, before Tricia arrives, having followed Leena.\n11) Instead of stopping Leena, Tricia opens fire on Donnan with a gun and kills him.\n12) Tricia reveals that she knows Leena is not Esther, who died four years earlier during an altercation with her older brother Gunnar, which Tricia covered up without Allen's knowledge.\n13) Tricia explains that she is only welcoming Leena to make Allen happy again and that if she refuses to cooperate, she would report her to the authorities for \"murdering\" Donnan.\n14) Leena reveals her true identity to Tricia, and the two then dispose of Donnan's body in a cellar hatch where the real Esther is buried and frame his disappearance as a vacation trip by forging an email to the police station.\n15) Tricia eventually terminates the deal but realizing that it would be too suspicious if \"Esther\" were to disappear again, Tricia and Gunnar pretend that Leena is still \"Esther\" in Allen's presence.\n16) Later, Tricia tries to poison Leena during dinner but Leena retaliates by feeding Tricia with a dead rat smoothie (the rat having died from eating Leena's poisoned food).\n17) She also attempts to push Tricia and Gunnar onto the railway tracks but is stopped by an incoming passenger.\n18) With Allen away at an art gallery exhibition, Leena tries fleeing by stealing Tricia's car, but she is soon found by a police officer.\n19) That night, Leena is brought back to the Albright house and Tricia and Gunnar finally decide to kill Leena for good.\n20) Tricia tries to stage a suicide, but Leena fights back and flees before Gunnar throws her down the stairs.\n21) Distracted by a phone call from Allen, who is returning home, Tricia and Gunnar search for Leena when she disappears.\n22) Gunnar eventually finds Leena in the art room but Leena shoots Gunnar with a crossbow and then stabs him to death with his fencing sword.\n23) An enraged Tricia and Leena fight in the kitchen, inadvertently setting the house alight in the process, and the pair flee to the roof as Allen returns home.\n24) Tricia and Leena both slip and end up clinging to the roof, begging Allen to save them, with Leena claiming Tricia attacked her, and Tricia trying to reveal the truth about Leena.\n25) Unable to save both of them, Allen chooses to help \"Esther\", causing Tricia to lose her grip and fall to her death.\n26) Allen then checks Leena's face, which causes her fake teeth to fall out.\n27) Realizing she is not Esther, Leena tries to defend herself by saying she did it for them and also confesses her love for him.\n28) Allen calls her a monster, causing an enraged Leena to accidentally push him off the roof.\n29) Leena then again dresses herself as Esther and leaves the burning house after cleaning off the blood on her face.\n30) Later, \"Esther\" is moved to an orphanage where she waits for a new family to adopt her.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Leena Klammer, a 31-year-old woman with a rare hormonal disorder that makes her appear like a 9-year-old child. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. Leena escapes from the Saarne Institute ( Sentence 1).\n2. Leena poses as \"Esther\" and is taken in by the Albright family (Sentences 4-5).\n3. Tricia discovers Leena's true identity and decides to use her to keep Allen happy (Sentence 12).\n4. Leena and Tricia's relationship deteriorates, leading to attempts on each other's lives (Sentences 16-20).\n5. The final confrontation where Leena fights Tricia and Gunnar, leading to their deaths and her escape (Sentences 22-29).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **Event 1 (Escape from Saarne Institute):** Leena is in a confined and controlled environment, but she manages to escape, which initially improves her state from captive to free.\n2. **Event 2 (Posing as \"Esther\"):** Leena's state improves significantly as she gains a new family and a life of luxury, moving from a life of confinement and possibly abuse to one of comfort and acceptance.\n3. **Event 3 (Tricia's Discovery):** Leena's state becomes precarious as Tricia knows her true identity but decides to keep her secret for her own reasons. This introduces a element of risk and unpredictability to Leena's life.\n4. **Event 4 (Deterioration of Leena and Tricia's Relationship):** Leena's state worsens as she and Tricia engage in a dangerous game of cat and mouse, with both attempting to harm or kill the other. This period is marked by high tension and constant threat to her life.\n5. **Event 5 (Final Confrontation):** Leena's state improves temporarily as she manages to outsmart and kill her adversaries, securing her freedom once again. However, she also faces the loss of her newfound \"family\" and the life she had built, and she must start anew.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the fluctuations in Leena's state throughout the story, it's clear that she faces significant challenges and dangers but also experiences periods of improvement and success. The story starts with Leena in a disadvantaged situation (in an institute), improves as she finds a new \"family\" and life, deteriorates as her secret is discovered and she faces threats to her life, and finally ends with her securing her freedom but losing the life she had built.\n\nThis pattern does not fit neatly into a simple \"Rags to Riches\" or \"Riches to Rags\" arc, as Leena's condition fluctuates significantly throughout the story. It also doesn't perfectly match the \"Icarus\" arc, as Leena does not rise to a position of power or success before falling. The \"Man in a Hole\" arc is the closest fit, as Leena falls into dilemmas (being discovered, facing threats) and finds ways out (killing her adversaries, securing her freedom), but the complexity of her situation and the multiple cycles of dilemma and recovery suggest a more nuanced interpretation.\n\nHowever, the provided classification is \"Man in Hole,\" which suggests focusing on the overall trend of Leena facing challenges and finding ways to overcome them, even if the story has more complexity than a single arc type can fully encapsulate.\n\n### 4.

Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Jake is in a position of control and success, having just led a successful rescue mission. His state is high, with a sense of accomplishment and respect from his peers.\n- **Event 2**: Jake's state remains positive as he accepts a new challenge, despite some personal reservations. His commitment to duty keeps him in a high state, albeit with a hint of apprehension about the future.\n- **Event 3**: The confrontation with General Lo introduces tension and conflict, but Jake's determination and sense of duty keep him focused. His state is still positive, with a growing sense of the mission's challenges.\n- **Event 4**: The discovery of the betrayal by his superiors and the subsequent loss of trust from Mira and possibly his own team hits Jake hard. His state plummets as he faces not only external enemies but also internal doubts and conflicts. This is a significant low point.\n- **Event 5**: After taking matters into his own hands and succeeding in exposing General Lo, Jake's state improves dramatically. He achieves a higher state than at the beginning, having found both personal and professional success, including a promotion and a romantic relationship with Mira, contributing to the peace in Ukraine.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. Jake starts in a high state (successful rescue), faces challenges and tensions (peacekeeping mission, confrontation with General Lo), experiences a significant downturn (discovery of betrayal and loss of trust), and then recovers to an even higher state (exposing General Lo, finding peace and love). This pattern of falling into a dilemma (or hole) and then finding a way out, ending better than at the beginning, is characteristic of the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc. However, given the specific classification provided and the detailed analysis, it seems the narrative might align more closely with a \"Double Man in a Hole\" due to the two significant cycles of dilemma and recovery Jake undergoes: the first being the challenges of the mission and the second, the deeper personal and professional crisis following the discovery of the betrayal, which he overcomes to achieve an even higher state.\n\n### 4.

and relentless tenacity, they gear up for a spectral showdown.\n18) A heightened vigour grips the narrative as they handpick ancient texts and sacred scriptures, endowing themselves with knowledge and courage to finally confront the enigmatic horror.\n19) Preparation ensues rapidly: they rehearse potent Gregorian chants sourced diligently from archaic Roman manuscripts, and acquire sacred water and silver crucifixes endorsed by the local cathedral.\n20) The real confrontation ensues during a hair-raising ouija board session.\n21) The film's scenes fluctuate in intensity, alternating between the stern duo employing their knowledge and guts to fend off horrifying spirits wrapped in Victorian garb, and the mysterious might of their exorcist verses.\n22) Amid the battlefield, the unanticipated arrival of Eleanor's spirit, casting an otherworldly blue luminescence, surfaces as the unexpected ally who vindicates her rightful place in their lineage.\n23) Her melodious lullaby-like whisper, guides Carol and Michael through this spectral adversity.\n24) The narrative inches towards its climax as dawn approaches, symbolizing victory, catharsis, and above all, liberation from the curse that had held them captive.\n25) Their unwavering spirit and unyielding struggle finally shatter the age-old familial curse, exorcising their bloodline from the confining spectral purgatory.\n26) As the curse breaks, Eleanor's spirit, now free from her nefarious chains, elegantly transitions towards the pacifying serenity of the afterlife.\n27) The formerly haunted mansion, now vacant of its spectral inhabitants, stands as a silent testament of Carol and Michael's victorious struggle.\n28) Victors of this supernatural combat, Carol, and Michael, make their exit from the mansion.\n29) Their departure marks the onset of a new beginning, an alleviated chapter for their lineage.\n30) Even as they move on, the burden of victory and fear intermingle.\n31) Leaving the de-haunted mansion behind, they cast one last lingering glance at the edifice that had tested their courage and conviction.\n32) Slowly, but surely, the duo blend back into their routine, indelibly affected by their ancestral engagement and yet, elevated by their triumphant encounter.\n33) The narrative concludes, leaving Carol and Michael standing under spots of their evolved identities, unchanged superficially yet profoundly mutated within.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better (e.g., 0→1→2→4→10)\n- Riches to Rags: Protagonist starts high and ends lower

        "output": "To classify the story arc type of the given narrative, let's follow the steps outlined.\n\n### 1. Identify the protagonist and 5 major events in the story.\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Carol, although the narrative often includes her friend Michael in their shared experiences and decisions. For the purpose of analyzing the story arc, we'll consider Carol as the primary protagonist, with Michael playing a significant supporting role.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n- **Event 1**: Carol discovers the untouched sewing room of her Grandma Eleanor (sentence 3), marking the beginning of her journey into the mystery.\n- **Event 2**: Carol and Michael decide to unravel the mystery of Eleanor's absence (sentence 5), indicating their commitment to solving the puzzle.\n- **Event 3**: They uncover the dark family history involving occultist magic and nefarious rituals (sentence 9), which deepens the mystery and introduces a sense of danger.\n- **Event 4**: The revelation of the ancestral curse and its connection to Eleanor's disappearance (sentence 14), which significantly raises the stakes and explains the supernatural events.\n- **Event 5**: The final confrontation and victory over the curse (sentences 20-25), culminating in the liberation of their lineage from the curse.\n\n### 2. Describe the protagonist's state and how it changed relative to the previous events.\n\n- **At Event 1**, Carol is in a state of curiosity and possibly concern for her grandmother's absence, but she is not yet entangled in the deeper, darker aspects of the mystery.\n- **By Event 2**, Carol's state shifts to one of determination and engagement, as she decides to investigate further with Michael. Her condition has improved in the sense that she is taking action, but she is also stepping into the unknown, which could potentially worsen her situation.\n- **At Event 3**, Carol's discovery of the family's dark past introduces fear and uncertainty, potentially worsening her state as she faces the reality of her family's history.\n- **By Event 4**, the revelation of the ancestral curse signifies a low point for Carol, as she faces not just a personal mystery but a supernatural threat to her lineage. Her state is worse due to the increased danger and complexity of the situation.\n- **At Event 5**, with the final confrontation and victory, Carol's state improves significantly. She not only solves the mystery of her grandmother's disappearance but also liberates her family from a curse, ending in a much better state than where she began.\n\n### 3. Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain your reasoning.\n\nThe story arc can be classified based on how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the narrative. Given that Carol starts in a state of curiosity and concern, falls into a deeper, more dangerous situation as the mystery unfolds, and then emerges victorious and liberated at the end, her journey follows a pattern where she faces a significant challenge (falling into a \"hole\") and then finds a way out, ending in a better state than she began.\n\nThis pattern matches the **Man in a Hole** story arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma and then finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning. The key elements of this arc are the protagonist's initial descent into trouble and their eventual rise to a resolution that improves their initial state.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story can be considered as Kay, the daughter of Edna, as the story revolves around her efforts to find and care for her mother, and her emotional journey throughout the narrative.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. **Discovery of Edna's Disappearance and the Strange House Condition** (Sentences 1-5): Kay and her granddaughter Sam find the house locked from the inside, with a strange black mold-like substance and furniture adorned with Post-it notes.\n2. **Edna's Return and Initial Assessment** (Sentences 6-9): Edna returns, and despite initial concerns, she is found to be mostly of sound mind, except for a large black bruise on her chest.\n3. **Deterioration of Edna's Condition and Supernatural Events** (Sentences 10-18): Edna's behavior becomes more erratic, and supernatural elements become more pronounced, including her sleepwalking, accusations towards Sam, and the discovery of a hidden passageway.\n4. **Descent into Horror** (Sentences 19-29): The situation escalates with Sam getting lost in the corridors, Edna's physical and mental condition worsening, and the house's condition deteriorating further.\n5. **Confrontation and Resolution** (Sentences 30-39): Kay and Sam flee from Edna, who has become disfigured and contorted, leading to a final confrontation and the realization of Edna's true state, culminating in a peaceful yet ominous ending.\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: Kay is concerned and proactive, taking initiative to find her missing mother.\n- **Event 2**: Kay is relieved that Edna is found but becomes increasingly worried about her mother's health and the strange occurrences in the house.\n- **Event 3**: Kay's state worsens as she experiences nightmares and deals with Edna's deteriorating behavior, indicating a decline in her emotional and psychological well-being.\n- **Event 4**: Kay's situation becomes more desperate and frightening as the supernatural events escalate, and Edna's condition deteriorates significantly.\n- **Event 5**: Kay reaches a point of horror and resignation, ultimately accepting her mother's fate and finding a moment of peace, but the story ends with a hint that she might suffer a similar fate, leaving her future uncertain.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. At the beginning, Kay is in a concerned but proactive state. As the story progresses, her situation and emotional state deteriorate due to the escalating strange events and her mother's condition. Despite moments of tenderness and resolution, the overall trajectory of Kay's condition is one of decline, from a state of hopeful concern to one of despair and acceptance of a horrific reality, with a hint of a potential future downfall.\n\nThis pattern fits the **Riches to Rags** story arc type, where the protagonist starts in a relatively higher state (concerned but proactive) and ends in a significantly lower state (despair and acceptance of horror, with a potential for future downfall).\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonists in the story are Lois and Richard, a lively and easy-going couple. Five major events in the story can be identified as follows:\n\n1. **Introduction to the idyllic life**: Lois and Richard are introduced in their idyllic 18th-century farmhouse, preparing for the holidays (sentences 1-3).\n2. **The salty cookie mishap**: Lois mistakenly swaps sugar for salt while baking Christmas cookies, leading to a comical moment (sentences 6-7).\n3. **The snowman competition**: The couple engages in a friendly competition with neighborhood kids to build the biggest snowman, which faces a setback when it starts melting prematurely (sentences 9-10).\n4. **The power outage**: The evening festivities are interrupted by a power outage, but Lois and Richard make the best of it (sentences 17-18).\n5. **The conclusion and reflection**: The gathering concludes with the guests singing Christmas carols, and Lois and Richard reflect on the day's events (sentences 23-24).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Lois and Richard are in a happy, preparatory state for the holidays, enjoying each other's company and the festive atmosphere.\n- **Event 2**: The couple experiences a minor setback with the salty cookie mishap, but their reaction is more amused than distressed, showing resilience and a light-hearted approach to mistakes.\n- **Event 3**: The snowman competition brings a sense of community and fun, despite the melting setback. Their state remains positive, focusing on the enjoyment of the activity rather than the outcome.\n- **Event 4**: The power outage could potentially dampen the mood, but Lois and Richard's ability to adapt and find alternative, enjoyable activities (roasting marshmallows, shadow charades) keeps their state upbeat and resourceful.\n- **Event 5**: The conclusion of the story finds Lois and Richard in a reflective, joyful state, appreciating the day's events and already planning for the next year's festivities. This shows a return to a high point, similar to their initial state but possibly enriched by the day's experiences.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the events and the protagonists' states throughout, the story can be analyzed in terms of how Lois and Richard's condition changes. Initially, they are in a good state, then face minor setbacks (the salty cookies, the melting snowman), but each time, they recover and even improve their situation by finding joy and laughter in the mishaps. The power outage, another potential downturn, is turned into a positive experience. Finally, they end the story in a high state, reflecting on the successful day and looking forward to the next year.\n\nThis pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonists face challenges but consistently bounce back, ending in a better or at least as good a state as they began with. This resilience and the cyclical nature of facing and overcoming setbacks align with the **Double Man in a Hole** story arc, where the protagonist faces two cycles of dilemma and recovery. However, upon closer examination, the story more closely resembles a narrative where the protagonists' overall state remains positive, with minor dips that are quickly recovered from, which doesn't perfectly fit the traditional definition of any single story arc provided but most closely aligns with a pattern of consistent resilience and positivity.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To classify the story arc type, let's first identify the protagonist and major events in the story.\n\n1. **Identify the protagonist and major events:**\n   - The protagonist can be considered as Art, given that his emotional journey and decisions play a pivotal role in the narrative's progression and climax.\n   - Five major events in the story are:\n     1. Art begins to speculate that the government and the scientists are wrong about the impending doom (Event 11).\n     2. Art discovers a dead family on the side of the road, leading to his realization of the reality of their situation (Event 15).\n     3. Art decides not to take the pill and runs away, only to be found by Simon (Events 14 and 17).\n     4. The group decides it's time to take their pills, and Art passes out, with his parents giving the pills to his siblings (Events 20 and 21).\n     5. Art wakes up after everyone else has taken the pills and died (Event 31).\n\n2. **Describe the protagonist's state and how it changed:**\n   - **Event 11:** Art is distressed and begins to question the authority's narrative, showing a shift from resignation to curiosity and hope. His state changes from passive acceptance to active questioning.\n   - **Event 15:** After discovering the dead family, Art is shocked and screams, indicating a realization of the dire situation. His state changes from hopeful questioning to fearful realization.\n   - **Events 14 and 17:** Art's decision not to take the pill and his subsequent running away show determination and a will to live. However, being found and returned home indicates a loss of control over his fate. His state changes from determined to helpless.\n   - **Events 20 and 21:** Art passes out, and his parents give the pills to his siblings, indicating a point of no return for those around him. Art's state appears hopeless as he is unaware of the impending death of his family.\n   - **Event 31:** Art wakes up to find everyone dead, but he himself is alive. This event shows a significant change in Art's state from apparent hopelessness to survival, albeit in a tragic context.\n\n3. **Classify the story arc type:**\n   - Given Art's journey, the story starts with Art in a relatively stable, albeit grim, situation (hosting a Christmas dinner amidst an impending catastrophe). As the story progresses, Art's condition worsens emotionally and psychologically as he faces the reality of death and the loss of his family ( Events 11 to 21). However, the final event (31) shows Art alive, which could suggest a turn for the better. \n   - Despite this final twist, considering the overall narrative and focusing on the emotional and situational journey of Art, the story can be seen as following a **Riches to Rags** arc. Art starts in a high-status position (relatively safe with his family) and ends in a significantly lower state (alive but alone and surrounded by death). The final turning point, while offering a glimmer of hope, does not negate the overall downward trajectory of Art's condition throughout the majority of the story.\n\n4. **Determined story arc type:**\nRiches to Rags"

Sarah faces her lifelong nemesis in a final showdown at the annual Christmas parade (sentence 14).\n5. With Lobo finally apprehended, Portland is safe, but Jacob falls severely injured in the confrontation (sentence 15 and 16).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Sarah's state is one of being haunted by her past and then shocked by the mysterious envelope. This event introduces a new challenge, shifting her from a state of attempted recovery to one of heightened alertness and concern.\n- **Event 2**: Recognizing the wolf emblem, Sarah's state becomes more fearful and nostalgic, revisiting past traumas. This deepens her emotional turmoil, making her more determined but also more vulnerable.\n- **Event 3**: Discovering a traitor within their ranks, Sarah feels betrayed, which adds to her stress and complicates her mission. Her state becomes more urgent and suspicious, as she now has to consider internal threats in addition to the external ones.\n- **Event 4**: Facing Anthony Lobo, Sarah's state is one of high tension and determination. This confrontation is a climax where she must use all her skills and experience to overcome her adversary. It represents a significant moment of courage and resilience for her.\n- **Event 5**: After apprehending Lobo and dealing with the aftermath, including Jacob's injury, Sarah's state evolves to one of relief, sadness, but ultimately resilience and strength. She has overcome her fears and adversaries, making peace with her past and preparing for future challenges.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the story. Initially, Sarah is in a state of vulnerability due to her past (sentence 1). As the story progresses, she faces numerous challenges that test her resolve and capabilities, such as the mysterious threats, the return of a thought-to-be-dead adversary, and a betrayal within her own ranks. These challenges worsen her condition, making her more fearful and stressed. However, she consistently finds ways to confront and overcome these challenges, culminating in a final showdown where she defeats her lifelong nemesis. Despite the victory coming at a personal cost (Jacob's injury), Sarah emerges stronger, having made peace with her past and ready to face future trials.\n\nThis pattern fits the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (the return of Anthony Lobo and the series of crimes) and finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning. Sarah starts in a vulnerable state, falls deeper into challenges and fears, but ultimately rises to overcome them, ending in a stronger and more resilient state.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Ross Ulbricht, the creator of the Silk Road website. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. Ross comes up with the idea for Silk Road (sentence 3).\n2. Ross starts the website and adopts the alias \"Dread Pirate Roberts\" (sentences 4 and 6).\n3. Silk Road gains popularity, and Ross makes millions (sentence 8).\n4. Law enforcement, led by DEA agent Rick Bowden, begins investigating Silk Road (sentence 10).\n5. Ross is eventually arrested and faces the legal consequences of his actions (sentences 15 and 27).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Ross comes up with the idea for Silk Road):** Ross is in a state of aspiration, looking to challenge government control and regulations. His condition is one of potential, with the idea for Silk Road representing a path to achieving his goals.\n- **Event 2 (Ross starts the website and adopts the alias \"Dread Pirate Roberts\"):** Ross's condition improves as he takes action on his idea, starting the website and creating an alias to operate anonymously. He is now a proactive entrepreneur, albeit in illegal activities.\n- **Event 3 (Silk Road gains popularity, and Ross makes millions):** Ross's condition peaks as Silk Road becomes successful, and he amasses a fortune. He is at the height of his power and influence within the dark web.\n- **Event 4 (Law enforcement begins investigating Silk Road):** Ross's condition begins to deteriorate as he faces the threat of law enforcement. Despite his initial success, the investigation signals the beginning of his downfall.\n- **Event 5 (Ross is eventually arrested and faces legal consequences):** Ross's condition reaches its lowest point as he is arrested and faces the consequences of his actions. His liberty, wealth, and anonymity are all lost.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the description of Ross's state at each major event, the story arc type can be classified. Initially, Ross is in a state of potential, then his condition improves as he starts and successfully runs Silk Road, reaching a peak. However, with the investigation and eventual arrest, his condition worsens significantly, ending in a much lower state than where he began.\n\nThe story follows a pattern where the protagonist starts in a relatively low position (aspiration without action), rises to a high point (success with Silk Road), and then falls to a lower point (arrest and loss of liberty). This pattern most closely aligns with the **Icarus** story arc type, where the protagonist rises to success but then faces a drastic downfall. However, given the specific details and the fact that Ross's condition starts low, rises, and then falls to an even lower point than where he started (considering his initial aspirations and eventual incarceration), the story also reflects elements of a **Riches to Rags** narrative, especially when focusing on the transition from wealth and influence to incarceration.\n\nGiven the provided classification and the details of the story, the best fit seems to be **Riches to Rags**, as it emphasizes the protagonist's significant downfall from a position of power and wealth to one of loss and incarceration, which is the overarching theme of Ross Ulbricht's story.\n\n### 4.

Describe the protagonist's state and changes at each event\n\n- **Event 1**: Alice is initially reluctant to care for Frank, fearing it will interfere with her work. Her state is one of solitude and focus on her research. This event sets a baseline for her isolation.\n- **Event 2**: As Alice begins to bond with Frank, her state changes to one of gradual openness and connection. She starts to see the value in their relationship, marking a positive shift from her initial loneliness.\n- **Event 3**: The discovery that Frank's mother is Vera introduces a complex mix of emotions for Alice, including surprise, potential heartache, and a deepened sense of responsibility towards Frank. This complicates her state, adding layers of emotional depth and a renewed sense of purpose in caring for Frank.\n- **Event 4**: The drama and danger of Frank's runaway attempt and the subsequent rescue effort plunge Alice into a state of distress and urgency.

As the story progresses, she faces challenges and complications, particularly with the introduction of Frank and the revelation about Vera. However, she also experiences moments of connection, love, and ultimately, a sense of belonging and purpose. The story's progression shows Alice falling into a dilemma (caring for Frank, dealing with her past) but then finding a way out that leads to a better state than where she started.

The Red Coyotes raid the town of Gibson, desecrating Samuel Hartley's mansion (sentences 2-3).\n2. Evan discovers Hartley's involvement in illegal gold trafficking with the Red Coyotes (sentence 7).\n3. The revelation of Evan's own tormented past with an outlawed gang (sentence 11).\n4. The kidnapping of Lily by a rogue Coyote, leading to Evan's personal crisis (sentence 18).\n5. The final confrontation where Evan confronts the Red Coyotes, leading to their defeat and the restoration of peace in Gibson (sentences 20-25).\n\n### 2. Description of Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Red Coyotes' raid):** Evan's state is one of responsibility and determination as he takes on the task of restoring balance in the town. His condition is neutral, as he is faced with a challenge but has not yet been personally affected.\n  \n- **Event 2 (Discovery of Hartley's involvement):** Evan's state becomes more complex, as he uncovers a web of corruption that involves one of the town's respected members. His condition slightly worsens due to the increased complexity of the situation and the moral challenge it presents.\n\n- **Event 3 (Revelation of Evan's past):** This event significantly affects Evan's state, as his past is exposed, potentially jeopardizing the trust the townsfolk have in him. His condition worsens, as he faces not only external challenges but also internal conflict and the risk of losing the town's support.\n\n- **Event 4 (Kidnapping of Lily):** Evan's state becomes deeply personal and critical, as his past and present collide with the kidnapping of someone he cares about. His condition worsens further, as he is torn between his duty to the town and his personal feelings, facing a nightmarish personal crisis.\n\n- **Event 5 (Final confrontation):** In the final event, Evan's state transforms as he confronts his past and the Red Coyotes. By revealing his tainted side and acting bravely, he resolves both his internal conflict and the external threat. His condition improves significantly, as he gains the respect and support of the townsfolk, and peace is restored to Gibson.\n\n### 3. Classification of Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the analysis of the protagonist's condition throughout the story, the narrative follows a pattern where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (the raid, the discovery of corruption, the revelation of his past, and the personal crisis with Lily's kidnapping) and then finds a way out, ending in a better state than at the beginning (with the defeat of the Red Coyotes, restoration of peace, and a newfound respect from the townsfolk). This pattern aligns with the **Man in a Hole** story arc type, where the protagonist's condition improves from the first turning point to the last turning point, despite facing significant challenges and setbacks along the way.\n\n### 4.

The family home is raided, and Jake's parents are killed (sentences 1-3).\n2. Jake volunteers to join the Dalton gang for a train heist (sentences 4-6).\n3. The gang discovers Pearl and decides to return her to Potemkin for a reward (sentences 7-9).\n4. The gang is attacked by witches in Potemkin, and many members are killed (sentences 13-15).\n5. Jake makes a deal with Maria to save his brother Duncan, and Duncan rides off to start a new life (sentences 29-30).\n\n### 2. Describe the protagonist's state at each event\n\nAt event 1, Jake's state is one of trauma and loss, having just witnessed his parents' murder and his home being burned down.\n\nAt event 2, Jake's state has changed to one of determination and risk-taking, as he volunteers to join the Dalton gang. He is trying to move on from his past and find a new sense of purpose.\n\nAt event 3, Jake's state is one of uncertainty and potential hope, as the gang discovers Pearl and decides to return her to Potemkin. He may see this as an opportunity for redemption or a chance to make things right.\n\nAt event 4, Jake's state has changed to one of fear and desperation, as the gang is attacked by witches and many members are killed. He is fighting for survival and trying to protect his brother.\n\nAt event 5, Jake's state is one of resignation and sacrifice, as he makes a deal with Maria to save his brother Duncan.

Classify the story arc type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, it appears that Jake's state worsens over time. He starts in a traumatic situation, but then takes risks and tries to find a new sense of purpose. However, things take a turn for the worse as he faces danger and loss, and ultimately, he is forced to make a difficult sacrifice to save his brother. This pattern of worsening conditions is consistent with the \"Riches to Rags\" story arc type, but it can also be argued that Jake's initial state is already quite low, and he does experience some moments of hope and determination before things take a turn for the worse. However, considering the overall trend of Jake's condition, it seems that his state deteriorates significantly over the course of the story.\n\n### 4. Determined story arc type\n\nRiches to Rags"

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist in this story can be considered as the group of four close-knit childhood friends—Nhat, Bao, Hien, and Trang—since the story revolves around their collective experiences and journey. However, for the sake of analysis, we can focus on the group's condition as a whole, considering their unity and shared goals as the core of the protagonist's identity.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. The announcement of growing political tensions (sentence 3) disrupts the friends' harmonious gathering.\n2. The friends are separated during the bombardment, and Trang is lost (sentence 6).\n3. The discovery of Jake, an American soldier, and the decision to aid him (sentence 8), leading to a pledge of mutual help in finding Trang.\n4. The discovery that Trang has been seized by a militant separatist group (sentence 13), prompting a rescue mission.\n5. The successful rescue of Trang and the group's return to Saigon, bearing scars but transformed (sentence 17).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **Initial Harmony (Before sentence 3):** The friends are in a state of joy and anticipation, sharing their dreams and aspirations. Their condition is positive and hopeful.\n2. **Disruption and Loss (Sentence 6):** The protagonist's state changes drastically as they face the harsh reality of war, leading to fear, uncertainty, and the loss of one of their own. Their condition worsens significantly.\n3. **Alliance and Determination (Sentence 8):** Despite the challenges, the friends find a new sense of purpose and determination. They form an alliance with Jake, which brings a glimmer of hope and a plan to rescue Trang. Their condition starts to improve as they find a way to act against their adversity.\n4. **Complication and Danger (Sentence 13):** Learning that Trang is held by a militant group introduces a new level of complexity and danger to their situation. The protagonist's state becomes more precarious, with increased risks and challenges ahead.\n5. **Resolution and Transformation (Sentence 17):** After successfully rescuing Trang and surviving their ordeal, the friends return home, scarred but stronger. Their condition has improved significantly from the low point of losing Trang and facing the dangers of war. They are now more united and transformed by their experiences.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, we observe a pattern where the friends start in a positive state, fall into a deep dilemma (loss and separation), and then work their way out of it through determination, alliances, and brave actions. The story arc type that best fits this pattern is the \"Man in a Hole\" arc. This arc is characterized by the protagonist falling into a problem or dilemma and then finding a way out, ending up in a better or at least a significantly improved state than when they were at their lowest.\n\nThe reasoning behind this classification is as follows:\n- The story begins with the friends in a harmonious and hopeful state.\n- It then descends into chaos and loss with the outbreak of war and the separation of the friends.\n- The friends hit their lowest point when Trang is lost and they are forced to navigate the dangers of war alone.\n- However, through their bravery, the formation of new alliances (with Jake), and their determination, they manage to rescue Trang and emerge from their ordeal stronger and more united.\n- The final state of the friends is one of hope and resilience, despite the scars they bear, indicating a significant improvement from their lowest point.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Lily, the 14-year-old sister who, along with her siblings, is evacuated from Manchester to the village of Oakworth. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Event 1: Introduction and Evacuation** - The story begins with the evacuation of Lily and her siblings from Manchester to Oakworth.\n2. **Event 2: Discovery of Abe** - The children find an African-American soldier, Abe McCarthy, in their hideout with an injured leg, and Lily decides to help him.\n3. **Event 3: Confrontation with the Truth** - Lily learns that Abe is a deserter and decides to help him escape, marking a significant decision that affects the story's progression.\n4. **Event 4: Capture and Detention** - Abe and Lily are caught by the US Military Police and detained, representing a low point for Lily.\n5. **Event 5: Resolution and Abe's Release** - The children successfully stop the train carrying Abe, and he is released after explaining his situation to a senior African-American general.\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: Lily's state is one of uncertainty and displacement as she and her siblings are evacuated from their home. This is a challenging situation but not necessarily a low point in terms of her personal condition or morale.\n- **Event 2**: Upon discovering Abe, Lily's state becomes more engaged and empathetic. She decides to help him, which shows her kindness and willingness to take risks. This could be seen as a rising action in her personal story arc as she takes on a new challenge.\n- **Event 3**: Learning the truth about Abe's desertion could potentially lower Lily's state as she faces the moral complexity of her decision to help him. However, her resolve to assist him despite the risks indicates a growth in her character, showing she is willing to stand up for what she believes in, even if it's challenging.\n- **Event 4**: Being caught and detained represents a significant downturn for Lily. She faces consequences for her actions and sees the person she was helping in danger. This is a clear low point in her story arc.\n- **Event 5**: The final event, where Abe is released, marks a high point for Lily. Her efforts, along with those of her friends and family, lead to a successful outcome. This resolution indicates an improvement in her state from the low point of being detained.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the progression of Lily's state throughout the story, it starts with her in a challenging situation (evacuation), rises as she finds purpose in helping Abe, faces a setback with the capture, and ultimately achieves a higher state with Abe's release and the positive outcome of their actions. This pattern fits the **Cinderella** story arc type, where the protagonist rises, faces a setback, and ultimately achieves a higher state. The initial challenging situation (evacuation), the growth and challenges (helping Abe and facing consequences), and the final positive resolution (Abe's release) align with the Cinderella arc's characteristics.\n\n### 4.

a cholera outbreak decimating them and leaving her to negotiate life’s cruel trials alone and unsupported.\n4) In her isolated grief, an empathetic elderly figure from the neighborhood, Ming, a former calligraphy master happens upon her, his highly esteemed status generating a level of curiosity.\n5) Ming, despite grappling with the grim grasp of the times and the dearth of available resources, manages to share what little supplies he has, and takes up the mantle of providing shelter for the grieving Chun-Hei.\n6) What follows are scenes filled with raw emotion, allowing the audience to witness Chun-Hei's efforts to adapt to her strange new life under Ming's roof, offering a sobering insight into her ongoing grief.\n7) Gradually adjusting to life with Ming, Chun-Hei unexpectedly uncovers a concealed ancient mahogany box, nestled in a dusty corner of Ming's humble dwelling.\n8) Within this box a trove of history lies hidden – old parchment family letters and beautifully preserved jade artifacts – narrating a history completely foreign to her.\n9) These timeless relics serve as a bridge between her present and a past steeped in audacious courage and grand sacrifices, unveiling the secrets of her noble lineage.\n10) Recognizing the bond that Chun-Hei forms with these artifacts, Ming takes it upon himself to introduce her to the traditional art forms of Han Chinese painting.\n11) This noble art, and the survival skills Ming imparts - such as foraging for plants, starting fires, and catching fish - serve to strengthen their bond and provide a shared language between them.\n12) But Ming doesn't stop here.\n13) He goes further to teach Chun-Hei the ancient Chinese practices of healing, equipping her with essential survival skills for the hardships that lay ahead.\n14) Weeks give way to months, and with the passing of time, Ming evolves in Chun-Hei's eyes from just an elderly friend to a surrogate family figure.\n15) However, just as she begins to find stability, despair looms large once again.\n16) Ming falls prey to a serious illness, characterized by debilitating coughs and raging fevers.\n17) Suddenly, Chun-Hei finds herself once again hurled into a whirlpool of uncertainty and fear.\n18) Taking inspiration from her ancestor's bravery, Chun-Hei plucks up the courage to make a desperate attempt to save the ailing Ming.\n19) She dares to navigate the treacherous outskirts of Kuala Lumpur, braving the dangers of a war-torn city to procure food, medicine, and other critically needed resources.\n20) Her fight against adversity captures the attention of a group of Red Cross aid workers, who are in the area and witness her extraordinary efforts for survival.\n21) Recognizing her courage and steadfastness, and driven by a belief that she deserves a safer life, the aid workers extend an invitation for her to relocate to a refugee camp set up in Singapore.\n22) The prospect of a future devoid of imminent danger is enticing, but leaves Chun-Hei grappling with the heartbreaking thought of leaving Ming behind.\n23) She finds herself torn between the loyalties she feels towards Ming on and the promise of a secure future.\n24) This conflict culminates in a scene that pulls at the heartstrings, as she confesses her predicament to a visibly deteriorating Ming.\n25) Ming, in an act of overwhelming selflessness, urges Chun-Hei to choose the future that promises her safety and survival, even at the cost of leaving him behind.\n26) A series of emotional discussions and thoughtful introspection prompts Chun-Hei to make the difficult decision to leave Malaysia.\n27) As she prepares to embark on her new life journey, she promises the ailing Ming that she will come back to him once the chaos prevalent in their homeland subsides.\n28) Chun-Hei's departure scene, filled with raw emotion and longing goodbyes, embodies the turmoil caused by political upheaval and a rampant disease.\n29) As she departs for Singapore, she firmly clutches the mahogany box filled with ancestral artifacts – symbols of the strength that helped her endure the harshest of times.\n30) The penultimate scene provides us with a resilient Chun-Hei ready to embark upon the red rescue ship, destined for her new life in Singapore.\n31) As the ship sets sail towards the equator, Chun-Hei holds onto her ancestral artifacts, her silhouette standing firm against the gusts of sea winds, indicating her preparedness for future challenges.\n32) She manifests the enduring spirit of resilience, a brave figure standing tall on the stern of the ship, her eyes emitting an unwavering spirit against the backdrop of the expansive South China Sea.\n33) Chung-Hei's tumultuous history and ties to colonial Malaysia no longer haunt her, but shape into a source of relentless strength.\n34) The last image the audience sees is an inspiring portrayal of Chun-Hei's incredible character strength, cast against the shadow of a tumultuous national history.\n35) The enduring theme of survival in the face of adversity echoes throughout the narrative, reinforcing the characters' resilience and determination.\n36) The story of her journey from Malaysia to Singapore captivates the audience's attention, instigating a reflection on her life amidst the ruins of colonial Malaysia.\n37) The film concludes, leaving the audience with a powerful testament to courage, determination, and survival amidst adversities.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better (e.g., 0→1→2→4→10)\n- Riches to Rags: Protagonist starts high and ends lower (e.g., 10→9→8→6→0)\n- Man in a Hole: Protagonist falls into trouble but recovers (e.g., 6→2→1→4→10)\n- Icarus: Protagonist rises then falls dramatically (e.g., 2→4→9→5→1)\n- Double Man in a Hole: Two cycles of fall and recovery (e.g., 6→2→7→4→10)\n- Cinderella: Rise, setback, ultimate triumph (e.g., 1→7→4→1→10)\n- Oedipus: Start high, fall, recover, final fall (e.g., 10→4→7→9→1)",
        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Chun-Hei, a young woman grieving the loss of her family. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **The loss of her family to cholera** (sentence 3): This event sets the initial condition of Chun-Hei's life, marking her as a grieving and isolated individual.\n2. **Meeting Ming and finding shelter** (sentence 5): This event changes Chun-Hei's state from isolation to having a form of support and shelter, albeit still grieving.\n3. **Discovering the ancient mahogany box and learning about her lineage** (sentence 7 and 8): This event shifts Chun-Hei's focus from mere survival and grief to a connection with her past and a sense of noble lineage, potentially empowering her.\n4. **Ming's illness and Chun-Hei's decision to find help** (sentences 16 and 18): This event plunges Chun-Hei back into uncertainty and fear, forcing her to confront the possibility of losing another person she cares about.\n5. **Chun-Hei's departure for Singapore** (sentences 26 to 31): This event marks a significant change in Chun-Hei's life, as she leaves behind the turmoil of Malaysia for a safer future in Singapore, symbolizing her growth and resilience.\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1 (Loss of family)**: Chun-Hei is in a state of grief and isolation. Her condition is at a low point.\n- **Event 2 (Meeting Ming)**: Chun-Hei's state improves slightly as she finds shelter and support, but she is still grieving. Her condition is better than at the start but still challenging.\n- **Event 3 (Discovering the mahogany box)**: Chun-Hei begins to connect with her heritage and finds a new sense of purpose. Her condition improves further as she starts to heal and find meaning.\n- **Event 4 (Ming's illness)**: Chun-Hei's state deteriorates again as she faces the potential loss of another loved one. Her condition worsens, filled with uncertainty and fear.\n- **Event 5 (Departure for Singapore)**: Despite the sadness of leaving Ming behind, Chun-Hei's decision to go to Singapore represents a move towards a safer, more secure future. Her condition improves as she embodies resilience and determination for a better life.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story does not follow a simple **Rags to Riches** arc because Chun-Hei's condition fluctuates significantly throughout the story, with periods of improvement followed by setbacks. It's not a **Riches to Rags** story since Chun-Hei ends in a better state than she began. The **Man in a Hole** arc is closer because Chun-Hei falls into dilemmas (loss of family, Ming's illness) and finds ways out, but the story's complexity, with its multiple downturns and recoveries, suggests a more nuanced classification.\n\nThe **Icarus** story arc, which involves a rise to success followed by a drastic downfall, does not perfectly fit because Chun-Hei's story is more about resilience and ultimate growth rather than a tragic fall. The **Cinderella** arc, involving a rise, a setback, and then a higher achievement, seems more applicable because Chun-Hei rises from her grief with Ming's help, faces a setback with his illness, and ultimately achieves a higher state by deciding to move to Singapore for a safer life.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\nThe protagonist of the story is Mary Lennox. The five major events in the story are:\n1. Mary being sent to her uncle's manor in Yorkshire, England, after being found abandoned in British India (sentences 1-2).\n2. Mary discovering the secret garden and meeting Dickon, who offers to help heal Jemima (sentences 11-20).\n3. Mary being punished for stealing the pearl necklace and then finding letters between her mother and aunt, which leads to a deeper connection with Colin (sentences 21-23).\n4. The fire at the manor, where Mary helps save Lord Craven and witnesses the beginning of a reconciliation between Lord Craven and his son Colin (sentences 24-28).\n5. The final scene where Lord Craven rebuilds the estate, and Mary, Dickon, and Colin enjoy the secret garden, symbolizing a newfound happiness and healing for all characters involved (sentence 31).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n- **Event 1:** Mary starts in a disadvantaged and emotionally repressed state, having lost her parents and been forgotten. Her condition is one of sadness and isolation.\n- **Event 2:** As Mary discovers the secret garden and meets Dickon, her state begins to improve. She starts to show kindness and a desire to help others (Jemima and later Colin), indicating a positive change in her emotional state.\n- **Event 3:** Despite being punished, Mary's discovery of the letters and her decision to share them with Colin deepens her connection with others and starts to heal her own emotional wounds. This shows a further improvement in her condition as she begins to form meaningful relationships.\n- **Event 4:** During the fire, Mary's bravery and selflessness in saving Lord Craven and ensuring Colin's safety demonstrate significant personal growth. Her actions are no longer solely focused on her own needs but on the well-being of others, indicating a positive shift in her character.\n- **Event 5:** In the final scene, Mary is depicted as part of a happy, healing community. She has formed strong bonds with Colin, Dickon, and indirectly with Lord Craven, showing a complete turnaround from her initial state of loneliness and emotional repression.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\nBased on the analysis, Mary's condition improves significantly from the beginning to the end of the story. She starts in a state of disadvantage, both emotionally and circumstantially, and ends in a much better state, having formed meaningful connections and undergone significant personal growth. This pattern aligns with the **Rags to Riches** story arc type, where the protagonist's condition improves from the first turning point to the last turning point.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist in the story is John Thompson. Five major events in the story are:\n1. John discovers a concealed trapdoor in the treehouse, leading him to an underground labyrinth (sentence 3-4).\n2. John becomes the primary suspect in the disappearance of Bethany Dunhill, leading to a whirlpool of mistrust and finger-pointing from the community (sentence 7-8).\n3.

John infiltrates one of the cult's secret rituals but is discovered, leading to a dangerous pursuit (sentence 13-15).\n5. John, with the help of the police, confronts and defeats the cult, leading to the rescue of Bethany and the beginning of John's redemption (sentence 19-20).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: John's state is one of seeking refuge and solace, haunted by his addiction but finding serenity in the treehouse. This event sets him on a path of discovery and potential change.\n- **Event 2**: John's state worsens as he becomes a suspect, facing suspicion and hostility from the community. His condition deteriorates due to the external pressure and his own internal struggles with addiction.\n- **Event 3**: John's state begins to improve as he uncovers the truth about the cult. This gives him a sense of purpose and direction, potentially marking a turning point in his struggle with addiction.\n- **Event 4**: John's state becomes more precarious as he is hunted by the cult. This event introduces significant danger and raises the stakes, testing John's resolve and courage.\n- **Event 5**: John's state improves dramatically as he succeeds in rescuing Bethany and contributing to the defeat of the cult. This success, coupled with his decision to renew his quest for sobriety, indicates a significant positive change in his condition.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the narrative. Given that John starts in a disadvantaged situation (struggling with addiction and personal loss), faces significant challenges and dangers (becoming a suspect, being hunted by a cult), but ultimately ends in a better situation (having helped defeat the cult, rescuing a victim, and renewing his quest for sobriety), his condition improves from the beginning to the end. This pattern, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (or several) and finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning, aligns with the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc type. The key characteristic of this arc is the protagonist's ability to overcome adversity and emerge in a superior state, which is evident in John's transformation from a haunted, addicted individual to someone on the path to redemption and recovery.\n\n### 4.

However, she navigates these challenges, finds amusement and joy in them, and ultimately ends in a better state than where she began, having stepped out of her comfort zone and found a new lease on life.\n\nThis progression—facing a dilemma and finding a way out, ending better than at the beginning—aligns with the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc type. The key characteristic of this arc is the protagonist's journey from a lower or troubled state to a higher or resolved state, which is exactly what Amelia experiences.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To classify the story arc type, let's follow the instructions step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the protagonist and 5 major events in the story:**\n   - The protagonist of the story can be considered as Clancy Finch, as the story revolves around her family and her actions drive a significant part of the plot.\n   - Five major events in the story are:\n     1. Clancy is invited to a party by her crush Travis Schultz but is grounded by her parents (sentences 1 and 5).\n     2. Clancy and her friend sneak out to go to the party, but before they can enjoy it, they discover that Clancy's parents have been taken by unknown individuals (sentences 7-11).\n     3. The kids discover that Clancy's mother, Margot, was in the Witness Protection Program and follow clues she left to find her (sentences 14-18).\n     4. They locate Margot and her father but also discover that Margot's ex-fiancé, Leo, is the head of a crime syndicate and has been manipulating events (sentence 28).\n     5. The family, along with their allies, manages to outsmart the syndicate, recover the stolen crown, and have Leo arrested (sentences 29-32).\n\n2. **Describe the protagonist's state and how it changed at each event:**\n   - **Event 1:** Clancy is excited about the party invitation but ends up grounded after arguing with her mother. Her state changes from hopeful to restricted and frustrated.\n   - **Event 2:** Clancy's state shifts from frustration to worry and fear as she discovers her parents are in danger. This introduces a significant dilemma.\n   - **Event 3:** Clancy's state changes from fear to determination as she and her friends work to find her parents. This marks a turning point where she begins to take action.\n   - **Event 4:** Upon discovering the truth about Leo and the syndicate, Clancy's state might change to one of shock or disbelief, but her determination to rescue her parents and solve the situation remains strong. This introduces a new layer of complexity to her dilemma.\n   - **Event 5:** Finally, Clancy's state improves as she and her family successfully overcome the challenges, recover the crown, and see justice served. This marks a resolution where Clancy's condition improves significantly from where it started.\n\n3. **Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain the reasoning:**\n   - The story starts with Clancy in a relatively normal, albeit frustrated, state. She then falls into a significant dilemma when her parents are taken, marking a downturn in her condition. As the story progresses, Clancy and her allies work to resolve this dilemma, facing additional challenges and setbacks along the way. Ultimately, they succeed in overcoming these challenges, leading to an improvement in Clancy's condition beyond where she started. This pattern of falling into a dilemma and then finding a way out, ending in a better state than at the beginning, is characteristic of the **Man in a Hole** story arc type.\n\n4. **Determined story arc type:**\nMan in a Hole"

Armstrong started receiving a torrent of threats from Roberts' followers.\n20) In the aftermath of his impressive performance, Roberts found himself questioning his beliefs and regretting his role in fostering racial discrimination, his mind filled with a newfound admiration for Armstrong.\n21) An internal struggle began to brew in him- should he continue to adhere to long-standing biases or acknowledge Armstrong's undeniable talent and moral courage?\n22) In an unprecedented move, Roberts decided to issue a public apology during his live radio segment.\n23) This bold on-air confession sparked a firestorm of negative reactions, leaving his professional reputation effectively in tatters.\n24) Despite the crushing public backlash, a sense of relief surged through Roberts.\n25) The radio apology turned out to be the end of an era - Roberts' entrenched radio career.\n26) This marked the beginning of a challenging journey of self-reformation and the unlearning of deeply ingrained biases.\n27) Roberts' sweeping broadcast initiated a paradigm shift in the radio journalism industry which changed it forever.\n28) Meanwhile, in the wider world, Armstrong commenced a nationwide tour using his music as a catalyst for societal change.\n29) Having retreated into privacy and self-reflection, Roberts introspected deeply on the harm he caused by wielding his radio platform irresponsibly.\n30) Acknowledge his past transgressions, Roberts vowed to dedicate the rest of his life towards rectification of the racial biases he had propagated and towards promoting equality.\n31) The film ends with a scene depicting a touching human moment- Roberts reaching out to Armstrong, suggesting a potential beginning of an unexpected but profound friendship.\n32) While the road to change was just beginning and attitudes did not change overnight, the radio incident had sparked a citywide chain reaction that initiated a period of transformation in societal views.\n33) The incident, etched in history as 'The Battle of the Airwaves,' was a turning point in music history.\n34) It triggered fundamental shifts in attitudes towards race, music, and the role of radio journalism, and laid the groundwork for an era that would eventually lead to a breakthrough in the media industry.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better (e.g., 0→1→2→4→10)\n- Riches to Rags: Protagonist starts high and ends lower (e.g., 10→9→8→6→0)\n- Man in a Hole: Protagonist falls into trouble but recovers (e.g., 6→2→1→4→10)\n- Icarus: Protagonist rises then falls dramatically (e.g., 2→4→9→5→1)\n- Double Man in a Hole: Two cycles of fall and recovery (e.g., 6→2→7→4→10)\n- Cinderella: Rise, setback, ultimate triumph (e.g., 1→7→4→1→10)\n- Oedipus: Start high, fall, recover, final fall (e.g., 10→4→7→9→1)",
        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist in the story is Harold Roberts, a radio show host. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. **Event 1**: Roberts invites Louis Armstrong to his radio show with the intention of challenging Armstrong's beliefs on racial equality (sentence 7).\n2. **Event 2**: The day of the radio show arrives, and Roberts commences the verbal duel with Armstrong (sentence 14).\n3. **Event 3**: Armstrong responds fervently to Roberts' antagonistic questions, leaving Roberts and the listeners dumbfounded (sentence 17).\n4. **Event 4**: Roberts issues a public apology during his live radio segment for his role in fostering racial discrimination (sentence 22).\n5. **Event 5**: Roberts decides to dedicate his life to rectifying the racial biases he propagated and promoting equality, marking a significant change in his life and career (sentence 30).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **At Event 1**: Roberts is in a position of power and influence, using his radio show to shape public opinion, but his intentions are sinister as he plans to undermine Armstrong's beliefs.\n- **At Event 2**: Roberts' state remains one of confidence and control as he initiates the confrontation with Armstrong on his radio show.\n- **At Event 3**: Roberts' state begins to deteriorate as he is outmaneuvered by Armstrong's impassioned responses, leading to a loss of control over the narrative of his show.\n- **At Event 4**: Roberts hits a low point, professionally and morally, as he apologizes for his actions, which leads to a significant backlash against him, damaging his reputation.\n- **At Event 5**: Roberts' state improves as he finds a new path, dedicated to rectifying his past wrongs and promoting equality, indicating a personal growth and redemption.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc can be classified based on how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the narrative. Initially, Roberts is in a high-status position but with questionable moral integrity. He then faces a significant downfall due to his confrontation with Armstrong and the subsequent public apology, which damages his professional reputation. However, instead of continuing in a downward spiral, Roberts undergoes a transformation, seeking redemption and personal growth. This pattern does not fit the \"Rags to Riches,\" \"Riches to Rags,\" \"Icarus,\" or \"Oedipus\" story arcs perfectly because it involves a fall followed by a rise that is more about personal redemption than a return to a previous state of power or success.\n\nThe closest match is the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (Roberts' downfall after the radio incident) and then finds a way out, ending in a better state (Roberts' redemption and personal growth). However, the traditional \"Man in a Hole\" arc typically involves the protagonist overcoming external challenges to achieve a better state. In this story, Roberts' transformation is more internally driven, focusing on his moral and personal growth rather than external success.\n\nDespite this nuance, the overall trajectory of Roberts' character, from a position of influence to a moral and professional low, followed by a rise into a state of personal redemption and growth, aligns most closely with the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, given the available options.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To classify the story arc type, let's first identify the protagonist and major events in the story.\n\nThe protagonist of the story appears to be Alfred, as the story revolves around his transformation and growth. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. Alfred's encounter with Seriphia, which leads to his downfall ( sentences 7-13).\n2. Eldric's intervention and Alfred's subsequent alliance with him (sentences 14-16).\n3. Alfred's training and growth under Eldric's guidance (sentence 17).\n4. The final confrontation with Seriphia, where Alfred plays a crucial role in defeating her (sentences 20-23).\n5. Eldric's death and Alfred's newfound responsibility to protect Nordhelm (sentences 24-27).\n\nNow, let's describe the protagonist's state at each event and how it changed relative to the previous events:\n- At event 1, Alfred is in a state of arrogance and ignorance, which leads to his downfall at the hands of Seriphia. His condition worsens as he is drained of his pride-induced energy.\n- At event 2, Alfred's state changes as he forms an alliance with Eldric, marking the beginning of his recovery and growth. His condition improves as he finds a new sense of purpose.\n- At event 3, Alfred's state continues to improve as he undergoes rigorous training and becomes adept in combat, signifying a significant transformation from his previous self.\n- At event 4, Alfred's state reaches a peak as he plays a crucial role in defeating Seriphia, demonstrating his newfound strength and bravery.\n- At event 5, Alfred's state changes again as he faces the loss of Eldric and the weight of responsibility to protect Nordhelm. Although he is saddened by Eldric's death, he emerges with a newfound sense of determination and purpose.\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, the story arc type can be classified as follows:\nThe story starts with Alfred in a high state (as a prince), but he falls into a dilemma (after encountering Seriphia). He then finds a way out of this dilemma (through his alliance with Eldric and subsequent growth) and ends in a better state (as a stronger, wiser, and more responsible leader). However, this classification seems to fit the \"Man in a Hole\" arc. But considering the overall story and the fact that Alfred faces two significant challenges (his initial downfall and then the responsibility after Eldric's death), it could also be argued that he faces two cycles of dilemma and recovery, which would align more closely with the \"Double Man in a Hole\" story arc type.\n\nDouble Man in Hole"

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Vesemir, a witcher. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. Vesemir saves a noble child from a leshen and discovers it was controlled (sentences 1-2).\n2. Vesemir is arrested for killing two knights in a bar fight (sentence 7).\n3. Vesemir and Tetra find Kitsu, and after a series of events, Vesemir decides to confront Deglan about the creation of monsters (sentences 11-15).\n4. Vesemir confronts Tetra, who has captured the mages and is holding them hostage, leading to a fierce battle (sentences 23-25).\n5. Vesemir mortally wounds Illyana, kills the mages, and later takes the witcher recruits under his wing (sentences 27-33).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: Vesemir is in a position of power and skill, able to save a child from a dangerous creature. His state is positive, with a sense of accomplishment.\n- **Event 2**: Vesemir's state worsens as he is arrested, indicating a loss of freedom and potentially a threat to his life or reputation.\n- **Event 3**: Vesemir's condition improves slightly as he gains more information about the controlled leshen and decides to take action against those responsible for creating monsters. He is proactive and seeking justice.\n- **Event 4**: Vesemir's state becomes more complicated and dire. He is engaged in a fierce battle, and despite his skills, he faces significant challenges, including illusions that threaten his perception of reality.\n- **Event 5**: Vesemir's condition takes a drastic turn for the worse. He inadvertently harms someone he cares about (Illyana), kills the mages, and faces the reality of his actions and the future of witchers. However, he also takes on a new responsibility (caring for the recruits), which could be seen as a step towards redemption or a new beginning.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the changes in Vesemir's state throughout the story, we can see that he faces significant downturns (arrest, battle with Tetra, harming Illyana) but also moments of resolution or new beginnings (deciding to confront Deglan, taking the recruits under his wing). The story does not follow a simple linear improvement or decline. Instead, Vesemir falls into dilemmas (arrest, moral crisis about the creation of monsters, the battle with Tetra) and finds ways out, but not without scars or significant losses. This pattern, where the protagonist faces challenges, overcomes them, but then faces another set of challenges, suggests a specific story arc type.\n\nThe initial decline into a dilemma (arrest), followed by actions that lead to more complications (battle, moral crisis), and then a final turn that involves both loss (Illyana's death, killing the mages) and a new beginning (taking care of the recruits), indicates that Vesemir's story is one of facing and overcoming challenges, but with significant personal costs.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To classify the story arc type of the given story, let's follow the steps outlined in the task.\n\n1. **Identify the protagonist and 5 major events in the story:**\n   - The protagonist of the story is Tom, the agile and seasoned automotive executive of Tesla.\n   - Five major events in the story are:\n     1. Tom's cyber-truck is rendered stranded amidst a tempest due to a jagged iron spike (sentence 4).\n     2. Tom ventures into the looming shadow of the ominous mansion (sentence 7).\n     3. Tom discovers the age-worn journals in the subterranean basement and learns about the past tenant's pursuit of a portal to reach alternate dimensions (sentence 13).\n     4. Tom inadvertently activates dormant machinery, initiating sequences that have remained unstirred, leading to paranormal phenomena (sentence 15).\n     5. Tom and Sebastian manage to close the destructive interdimensional rift (sentence 26).\n\n2. **Describe the protagonist's state and how it changed relative to the previous events:**\n   - **Event 1 (Tom's truck is stranded):** Tom's state changes from being in control and safe to being stranded and vulnerable. His condition worsens due to the unforeseen storm and the accident.\n   - **Event 2 (Tom ventures into the mansion):** Tom's state changes from being alone and stranded to finding potential shelter and safety. However, the mansion's ominous nature introduces uncertainty and potential danger, so his condition is still precarious.\n   - **Event 3 (Discovery of journals):** Tom's state changes from mere survival mode to curiosity and engagement. He starts to uncover the mysteries of the mansion, which could potentially improve his understanding and situation, but also deepens his involvement in the unknown.\n   - **Event 4 (Activation of machinery):** Tom's state deteriorates significantly as he faces paranormal phenomena and an interdimensional rift, putting him in greater danger than before. His condition worsens due to the activation of the machinery and the ensuing chaos.\n   - **Event 5 (Closing the rift):** Tom's state improves dramatically as he and Sebastian succeed in closing the rift, restoring order, and ensuring safety. This event marks a significant improvement in Tom's condition from the previous events, as he not only resolves the immediate crisis but also discovers more about his family's past and finds a new purpose.\n\n3. **Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain the reasoning:**\n   - The story arc type can be classified based on how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the story. Initially, Tom is in a good state as a successful executive but faces a series of challenges that worsen his condition (stranded, facing the unknown in the mansion, dealing with paranormal activities). However, through his actions and discoveries, he eventually improves his situation by resolving the crisis (closing the rift) and gaining new insights (about his grandfather and the mansion's secrets).\n   - This pattern follows the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (or multiple dilemmas) and finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning. Tom's journey from being a stranded executive to uncovering the secrets of the mansion, facing supernatural challenges, and ultimately finding a way to restore order and connect with his family's legacy, exemplifies this arc. He starts in a relatively good position, falls into several challenges, and ends in a better position, both in terms of his personal growth and his understanding of his family's past.\n\n4. **Determined story arc type:**\n   Man in a Hole"

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story can be identified as Glen, given that the narrative revolves significantly around his experiences, perceptions, and interactions, especially with Cyndi and the unfolding mystery involving Art and the asylum.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. Glen's car runs over a spike strip, and he seeks refuge in Art and Cyndi's home (sentences 1-3).\n2. Art persuades Glen to sleep with Cyndi, which is later revealed to be a hypnotic suggestion (sentence 6).\n3. Glen discovers that he and Cyndi are patients in a mental asylum, and their interactions were part of their therapy or a result of hypnotic suggestions (sentence 11).\n4. Shannon helps Glen and Cyndi escape the asylum (sentence 20).\n5. Glen, Cyndi, and Shannon finally escape the asylum for good, but Glen remains partially in a trance (sentences 26-28).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Glen is in a vulnerable state, seeking refuge. His condition is one of need and dependency.\n- **Event 2**: Glen's state changes to one of compliance under hypnotic suggestion, indicating a loss of control over his actions. This event marks a significant downturn in his autonomy.\n- **Event 3**: The revelation about the asylum and hypnotic suggestions places Glen in a state of confusion and disorientation, realizing his perceptions were manipulated. This is a low point, as he understands he has been living under false pretenses.\n- **Event 4**: With Shannon's help, Glen and Cyndi escape, marking an improvement in Glen's state as he begins to gain freedom and potentially insight into his situation.\n- **Event 5**: Glen's final state is one of partial liberation, both physically from the asylum and psychologically from some of the hypnotic suggestions. However, he remains partially in a trance, indicating that while he has made progress, he is not fully recovered or in control.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. Glen starts in a vulnerable state, falls deeper into a situation where he loses control (under hypnotic suggestion), then hits a low point with the revelation about the asylum. He then experiences a rise as he escapes the asylum, but ends in a state that is somewhat improved yet still compromised (partially in a trance).\n\nThis pattern does not fit the \"Rags to Riches\" or \"Cinderella\" arcs, as Glen does not end in a significantly better state than where he started. It doesn't fit \"Riches to Rags\" since Glen does not start in a high-status position. The \"Man in a Hole\" and \"Double Man in a Hole\" arcs are also not perfect fits because Glen's escape and subsequent state do not indicate a complete recovery or a return to a better state than the beginning. The \"Icarus\" arc does not apply as Glen does not rise to a peak of success before falling.\n\nHowever, considering the Oedipus story arc type, which involves a protagonist who starts high, falls, recovers, and then faces another significant downfall, Glen's story can be seen to loosely fit this pattern if one considers his initial refuge-seeking state as a baseline, his descent into hypnotic manipulation as a fall, his escape as a recovery, and his final state of being partially in a trance as another downfall, albeit one that is part of a complex, ongoing struggle rather than a complete collapse.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is William Duncan, a family man whose life takes a dramatic turn after his daughter's tragic death. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Kat's Death**: The event that sets the story in motion, where William's daughter Kat is killed by Danny, one of Donnie's sons.\n2. **William's Revenge Begins**: William intentionally lets Danny go free and then kills him, marking the beginning of his quest for revenge.\n3. **Ambush and Wife's Death**: William and his wife Jen are ambushed by Rory and Donnie, resulting in Jen's death and leaving William for dead.\n4. **William's Training and Preparation**: After surviving the ambush, William escapes from the hospital, trains himself, and prepares to take down Donnie and Rory.\n5. **Final Confrontation and William's Death**: The climax of the story where William confronts and kills Donnie and Rory but ultimately succumbs to his injuries.\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **At Kat's Death**: William's state changes from a peaceful family life to one of grief and anger, setting him on a path of revenge.\n- **As William's Revenge Begins**: William's state shifts from being a law-abiding citizen to a vigilante, driven by a desire for vengeance. This marks a significant downfall in his moral and legal standing.\n- **After the Ambush and Wife's Death**: William hits a low point, having lost his daughter and now his wife, and being left for dead. This is a significant worsening of his condition.\n- **During William's Training and Preparation**: William starts to recover and regain control, preparing himself physically and mentally to take down his enemies. This marks an improvement in his condition as he moves from being a victim to becoming an active agent of revenge.\n- **At the Final Confrontation and William's Death**: William achieves his goal of revenge but at the cost of his own life. This can be seen as both a peak in terms of achieving his objective and a trough in terms of his physical and emotional state, as he dies.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc of William Duncan can be classified based on the pattern of his condition throughout the story. Initially, William is in a high state, enjoying a peaceful life with his family. The death of his daughter sets off a chain of events that leads to a significant downfall (the death of his wife and his own near-death experience), followed by a recovery phase where he trains and prepares for revenge. Ultimately, he faces another significant downfall with his death, despite achieving his goal of revenge.\n\nThis pattern of starting high, falling, recovering, and then facing another significant downfall aligns with the **Oedipus** story arc type. The Oedipus arc is characterized by a protagonist who starts in a position of power or happiness, suffers a reversal of fortune, recovers or adjusts to their new circumstances, but ultimately suffers another, often final, downfall.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story can be considered as the family unit, particularly focusing on Edward, as the narrative often revolves around his beliefs and actions. However, for the sake of analysis, we'll consider Edward as the central figure through whom the story's progression is largely viewed.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. **Introduction of the \"divine nectar\"** ( Sentence 2): Edward introduces a lychee-flavored beverage from his spiritual journey in Tibet, which he believes has holy properties.\n2. **The onset of strange phenomena** (Sentence 6): After consuming the \"divine nectar,\" the family starts experiencing strange and unexplained events.\n3. **Tension and rift within the family** (Sentence 14): Edward's fervent belief in the spiritual properties of the drink creates tension and rifts within the family, isolating him from the others.\n4. **Discovery of the root cause of the phenomena** (Sentence 20): Lily and Mandy discover that the strange events are rooted in their psychological landscape, stemming from their unresolved fears and insecurities.\n5. **Resolution and newfound understanding** (Sentence 31): Edward apologizes for his actions, and the family comes to a newfound understanding and appreciation for each other, having learned to confront their fears and grow from their experiences.\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Introduction of the \"divine nectar\")**: Edward is filled with renewed vigor and a sense of spiritual fulfillment. His condition is positive, reflecting his enthusiasm and belief in the \"divine nectar.\"\n- **Event 2 (The onset of strange phenomena)**: The family's experience of strange phenomena introduces uncertainty and tension. Edward's condition, while still optimistic due to his faith, begins to show the first signs of potential conflict as the family's reactions are mixed.\n- **Event 3 (Tension and rift within the family)**: Edward's condition worsens as his beliefs cause rifts within the family, leading to isolation. This marks a low point in his relationship with his family members.\n- **Event 4 (Discovery of the root cause of the phenomena)**: This event marks a turning point for Edward and the family. While it doesn't immediately resolve the tension, it sets the stage for understanding and growth. Edward's condition begins to improve as he starts to see the error in his rigid beliefs.\n- **Event 5 (Resolution and newfound understanding)**: Edward's condition significantly improves as he apologizes and the family comes together, stronger and more united. This event shows a marked improvement from the low point of tension and isolation.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the analysis, the story arc type can be classified by observing the protagonist's (Edward's) condition throughout the narrative. Initially, Edward is in a positive state, introducing the \"divine nectar\" with enthusiasm. However, as the story progresses, his condition worsens due to the tension and rifts caused by his beliefs. This decline is followed by a turning point where the family discovers the root cause of their troubles, leading to a path of resolution and growth. Ultimately, Edward's condition improves as he learns from his mistakes, apologizes, and the family reunites on a stronger footing.\n\nThis pattern, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (the rifts and isolation caused by his beliefs) and then finds a way out (through apology and newfound understanding), improving his condition from the start, fits the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc type.\n\n### 4.

Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story can be considered as the Anderson family as a whole, since the narrative revolves around their collective experiences and adventures. However, if we were to pinpoint a central character, Max, the family's Golden Retriever, plays a pivotal role in initiating and driving the plot forward.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. The introduction of the treasure map (Event 12).\n2. The family's decision to embark on a treasure hunt (Event 13).\n3. The point at which the treasure hunt starts to strain the family's relationships and daily life (Event 25).\n4. The confrontation with the villains, Larry and Barry, and their subsequent arrest (Events 29-32).\n5. The discovery of the treasure and the realization of its historical significance (Events 36-43).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1 (Introduction of the treasure map):** The Anderson family is in a state of mundane routine. The discovery of the map introduces excitement and anticipation, improving their state from ordinary to extraordinary.\n  \n- **Event 2 (Decision to embark on a treasure hunt):** The family decides to pursue the adventure, indicating a willingness to leave their mundane lives behind. Their state changes from passive to active, as they take on a new challenge with enthusiasm.\n\n- **Event 3 (Strain on family relationships):** As the treasure hunt progresses, it begins to take a toll on the family's life, causing stress and strain on their relationships. Their state worsens from a united, excited front to a fractured, stressed one.\n\n- **Event 4 (Confrontation with villains):** The family faces a significant challenge with the confrontation but emerges victorious with Max's help. This event marks a turning point where their state improves from stressed and fractured to relieved and united again.\n\n- **Event 5 (Discovery of the treasure):** The discovery of the historical artifacts, though initially disappointing, leads to a profound realization of the treasure's significance and earns the family recognition and respect. Their state changes from potential disappointment to one of pride and fulfillment.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc can be classified based on how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the narrative. Initially, the Anderson family is in a mundane state (low point). The introduction of the treasure map and their decision to pursue it mark an improvement in their condition (rising action). However, as the hunt progresses, it causes strain, representing a downturn (falling action). The successful confrontation with the villains and the ultimate discovery of the treasure, which leads to their recognition and a better life, signify an improvement in their condition (rising action again).\n\nGiven these fluctuations, the story resembles a **Double Man in a Hole** arc. The first cycle involves the family moving from a mundane life (hole) to excitement and adventure (out of the hole), then back into stress and strain (into another hole). The second cycle starts with them overcoming the villains and discovering the treasure, leading to a final state of fulfillment and recognition (out of the hole again).\n\n### 4.

His condition improves.\n- **Event 4:** Marmaduke reaches a peak, competing in the World Dog Championship and overcoming challenges, showing significant improvement and redemption.

This pattern matches the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist falls into a problem, works to resolve it, and ends up in a better position than at the start.\n\n### 4.

Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe story revolves around two main characters, Amelia and Evan, but for the purpose of analyzing the story arc, we can consider Evan as the primary protagonist since the story significantly explores his journey from facing writer's block to finding inspiration and love.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. Evan decides to leave New York for Los Angeles to overcome his writer's block (Event 5).\n2. Evan meets Amelia at a card game and wins, earning a home-cooked dinner (Event 10).\n3. The chaotic evening leads to a power outage, during which Evan and Amelia share stories, kindling a spark in Evan's creativity (Event 15).\n4. Evan overcomes his writer's block and begins writing his novel, inspired by his experiences with Amelia (Event 33).\n5. Evan confesses his feelings to Amelia, and they both realize their love for each other, culminating in Evan's triumph over his creative stagnation and personal growth (Event 38).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1 (Evan leaves for LA):** Evan's state is one of frustration and creative blockage. He is seeking a change to overcome his writer's block.\n- **Event 2 (Meets Amelia):** Evan's state improves slightly as he meets someone new and interesting, but he is still struggling with his writing.\n- **Event 3 (Power outage evening):** Evan's state improves significantly as the evening sparks his creativity, providing him with exciting material for his book.\n- **Event 4 (Overcomes writer's block):** Evan's state is one of triumph and productivity, having overcome his creative stagnation.\n- **Event 5 (Confesses feelings to Amelia):** Evan's state reaches a peak of personal and professional fulfillment, having found love and successfully written his novel.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the story. \n- Initially, Evan is in a state of disadvantage (writer's block), which can be considered as the \"rags\" part of a story arc.\n- As the story progresses, Evan's condition improves significantly. He finds inspiration, overcomes his writer's block, and finds love, which can be seen as moving towards \"riches.\"\n- There are no significant downturns after Evan's initial improvement, indicating a consistent upward trajectory in his condition.\n\nGiven this progression, the story fits the **Rags to Riches** arc, where the protagonist starts in a disadvantaged situation and ends in a much better one, with continuous improvement from the first turning point to the last.\n\n### 4.

This event improves their condition from the previous state of confusion, as they are now engaged in a thrilling and unexpected adventure.\n- **Event 4:** The debate over the manuscript's credibility and the subsequent chaos introduce a state of tension and comedic absurdity. While their condition might seem to worsen due to the conflict, the overall tone of the story keeps the situation humorous and engaging. This event can be seen as a temporary downturn before they resolve the situation.\n- **Event 5:** Reflecting on their adventure at Arnold's estate, the group's state is one of contentment and strengthened friendship. They have overcome their misadventures and are now in a better condition than at the start, having shared a unique and bonding experience.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\nThe story arc type can be classified based on how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the story. Given the events outlined:\n- The group starts in a positive state, looking forward to meeting in person.\n- They then face a series of misadventures and confusions, which can be considered a downturn.\n- However, they quickly recover and experience an uplift with the exciting discovery of the manuscript.\n- A temporary conflict arises over the manuscript, but it is resolved in a comedic and positive manner.\n- Finally, they end in a better state than they began, with strengthened friendships and memorable experiences.\n\nThis pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonists face challenges, recover, and ultimately end in a better state than they started. The presence of two significant cycles of dilemma (the meeting spot confusion and the manuscript debacle) and recovery (finding the manuscript and resolving the conflict) indicates a specific story arc type.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To analyze the story arc, let's first identify the protagonist and major events in the story.\n\nThe story revolves around four friends (Sharon, Carol, Vivian, and Diane), but for the purpose of this analysis, we can consider the group as a collective protagonist or focus on the character that undergoes the most significant development. However, since the story is more about their collective journey and less about individual character development, we'll analyze the story based on the group's experiences.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. The friends decide to take a bachelorette trip to Italy (sentence 4).\n2. They fall victim to theft at the train station, losing their luggage, including Diane's urn with her husband's ashes (sentence 8).\n3. They experience a series of adventures and personal connections in Venice, including Sharon meeting Ousmane and Carol reconnecting with Gianni (sentences 12-16).\n4. The group faces legal trouble after a misunderstanding with the police, leading to their brief incarceration (sentence 25).\n5. The friends ultimately make it to Tuscany, where Vivian's wedding takes place, along with an unexpected marriage between Diane and Mitchell (sentences 29-31).\n\nNow, describing the protagonist's (group's) state and how it changes at each event:\n- At event 1, the group is in a state of anticipation and excitement, looking forward to their trip and Vivian's upcoming wedding. Their condition is positive, eager for adventure.\n- By event 2, the group's state worsens as they become victims of theft, losing their belongings and Diane's urn, which contains sentimental value. This is a clear downturn in their condition.\n- At event 3, the group's state improves as they enjoy their time in Venice, forming new connections and experiencing personal growth. This marks a recovery from the previous low point.\n- Event 4 sees the group's state decline again as they face legal issues and are jailed, which is another downturn.\n- Finally, at event 5, the group's state improves significantly as they not only make it to the wedding but also experience additional joy with Diane and Mitchell's marriage. This event marks a higher point than where they started, as they've grown through their experiences and formed deeper bonds.\n\nGiven these observations, the story arc type can be classified based on the pattern of the group's condition throughout the story. The group faces a dilemma (theft), recovers and experiences growth (in Venice), faces another setback (legal trouble), and ultimately ends in a better state than they began (the successful and joyful conclusion of the trip with the weddings).\n\nThe determined story arc type is Double Man in a Hole."

Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **Initial Return**: Jake is in a state of obligation and possibly emotional turmoil due to his return to a place he left 20 years ago and the task of dealing with his mother's estate. His condition is somewhat negative due to the circumstances.\n2. **Discovery and Meeting**: Jake's state becomes more engaged and possibly hopeful as he meets Rachel and becomes involved in her quest.

This is a low point for Jake, indicating a downturn in his condition after the progress made.\n5. **Resolution and New Beginning**: Despite the initial rejection, Jake finds the strength to declare his love and takes steps to help Rachel find her birth mother. The story ends with Rachel returning to him, indicating a significant improvement in Jake's condition from the start of the story. He has confronted his past, found love, and seems to be on a path towards healing and new beginnings.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story follows Jake as he falls into a dilemma (dealing with his mother's death and estate, confronting his past) and finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning (finding love, reconnecting with his past, and moving towards healing). The protagonist's condition improves from the first turning point (returning home) to the last turning point (Rachel's return), with fluctuations in between (especially the low point after Rachel's initial rejection). This pattern fits the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist faces a dilemma, hits a low point, but ultimately recovers and ends in a better state than where they started.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To classify the story arc type, let's break down the story into its key components.\n\n### 1. Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story can be considered as the group of teenagers, including Steven, Alex, Lisa, and the Anderson siblings (Mark, George, Henry, and Jennifer), as the story revolves around their collective experiences and actions. However, if we were to pinpoint a central figure, Jennifer emerges as a key protagonist due to her pivotal role in the climax of the story.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. **The Discovery of the Antique Lantern**: The Anderson siblings find an antique, Victorian-style lantern in their attic, which sparks their curiosity and leads to the unfolding of the story's events (sentence 6).\n2. **The Activation of the Temporal Portal**: The siblings, by manipulating the lantern, inadvertently activate a temporal portal, bringing two time travelers and later, futuristic creatures into their world (sentences 10-12).\n3. **The Realization of the Catastrophe**: The time travelers inform the group about an imminent disastrous event threatening Riverdale, prompting the teenagers to take action (sentences 20-22).\n4. **The Battle Against the Futuristic Creatures**: The group faces off against the invading androids and half-human, half-robotic creatures, leading to a climax where Jennifer plays a crucial role in manipulating the temporal device to send the invaders back (sentences 32-40).\n5. **The Resolution and Victory**: The teenagers, with the guidance of the time travelers, successfully defeat the invaders, save their town, and then decide to keep their adventure a secret, bonding over their shared experience (sentences 41-48).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1 (Discovery of the Lantern)**: The protagonist (Jennifer and her siblings) is in a state of curiosity and excitement, looking for ways to enhance their DIY film project. Their state is one of innocence and anticipation.\n- **Event 2 (Activation of the Temporal Portal)**: The protagonist's state shifts to one of shock, fear, and confusion as they encounter the time travelers and the futuristic creatures. This marks a significant downturn in their state, moving from a carefree and creative mindset to one of peril.\n- **Event 3 (Realization of the Catastrophe)**: The realization of an impending disaster deepens the protagonist's state of fear and anxiety but also sparks a sense of determination and responsibility. They begin to transition from victims to heroes.\n- **Event 4 (Battle Against the Futuristic Creatures)**: During the battle, the protagonist's state is one of intense fear, panic, and determination. They are fighting for their town's safety and their own lives. This is the lowest point for the protagonist, as they face their greatest challenge.\n- **Event 5 (Resolution and Victory)**: After successfully defeating the invaders and saving their town, the protagonist's state changes to one of relief, pride, and a sense of accomplishment. They have overcome their fears and the challenges, emerging victorious and more united than ever.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, we observe a pattern where the protagonist starts in a relatively positive state (curiosity and excitement), falls into a dilemma (fear, confusion, and peril), and then finds a way out, ending in a better state than where they began (relief, pride, and accomplishment). This pattern aligns with the **Man in a Hole** story arc, where the protagonist faces a significant problem, hits a low point, and then recovers, emerging stronger or in a better situation than before.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Samantha (Sam), as the narrative revolves around her interactions, decisions, and emotional journey.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. Sam becomes enamored with Billy, who seems to take an interest in her (sentence 2).\n2. Sam's parents ground her and leave her home alone, leading to her decision to pursue a more adult persona to impress Billy (sentence 4).\n3. Billy convinces Sam to host a Halloween party, which ends in disaster (sentences 9-14).\n4. Sam discovers the truth about Billy's intentions and witnesses the horrific actions of the aliens, leading her to take action to rescue her brother and friends (sentences 18-23).\n5. The final confrontation and resolution, including the defeat of the aliens and the subsequent capture by the armed soldiers (sentences 29-37).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **Event 1 (Sam becomes enamored with Billy):** Sam's state is one of infatuation and hope for a relationship. She is in a relatively positive state, looking forward to potentially impressing Billy.\n2. **Event 2 (Sam's parents ground her):** Sam's state worsens as she feels restricted and possibly ashamed due to being grounded. However, she sees this as an opportunity to change and impress Billy, so there's a mix of negative feelings and hopeful anticipation.\n3. **Event 3 (The Halloween party disaster):** Sam's state deteriorates significantly as she realizes Billy's true intentions and faces physical threats from him. She is betrayed, scared, and embarrassed.\n4. **Event 4 (Sam takes action against the aliens):** Sam's state improves as she finds the courage to act against the aliens to save her brother and friends. She is determined, brave, and proactive, indicating a positive shift in her condition.\n5. **Event 5 (Final confrontation and resolution):** Sam's state becomes complex; she experiences relief and possibly pride in helping to defeat the aliens but then faces uncertainty and fear as she and her friends are captured by the soldiers. This capture and the subsequent events leave her in a state of vulnerability and uncertainty.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the changes in Sam's state throughout the story:\n- She starts in a hopeful, positive state (enamored with Billy).\n- Her state worsens as she faces grounding, betrayal, and physical threats ( Events 2 and 3).\n- She then experiences an improvement in her state as she takes action against the aliens (Event 4).\n- Finally, her state becomes one of vulnerability and uncertainty as she is captured (Event 5).\n\nThis pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist starts in a relatively good position, falls into difficulties, recovers to some extent, but then faces another significant challenge or downfall. This does not perfectly fit the \"Riches to Rags\" classification provided, as that implies a consistent decline from a high starting point to a low ending point without significant recovery. Instead, Sam's journey involves a rise, a fall, a recovery, and then another complication, which more closely aligns with the \"Oedipus\" story arc type, where the protagonist starts high, falls, recovers, and then faces another downfall.\n\n### 4.

His condition could be considered as falling into a potential dilemma due to Rodrick's influence.\n- **Event 2:** Greg's state worsens as he is exploited and locked in the basement by Rodrick, but he manages to gather blackmail material, indicating a potential for future leverage or improvement in his condition.\n- **Event 3:** Greg's condition improves slightly as he and Rodrick clean up, avoiding immediate punishment, but he is still at odds with Rodrick.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonists in the story are Madison Carter and Noah Mitchell, who are both central characters around whom the plot revolves. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n- Event 1: The introduction of Madison and Noah amidst their high-pressure jobs at Two Peak Enterprises, with a budding romance (sentences 1-4).\n- Event 2: The discovery of a discrepancy in a billion-dollar deal that raises alarm bells, leading to a secret investigation (sentence 9).\n- Event 3: The realization that their respected boss is behind the corruption, followed by swift and vicious retaliation (sentences 15-16).\n- Event 4: Madison and Noah securing evidence and taking a moral stand to expose their boss's unscrupulous activities (sentences 18-20).\n- Event 5: The aftermath of exposing the corruption, leading to the downfall of Two Peak Enterprises and the protagonists deciding to leave the world of finance (sentences 24-26).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: At the beginning, Madison and Noah are in a high-status position professionally but face the challenge of keeping their relationship secret. Their condition is relatively stable, with a positive personal development (budding romance) amidst professional demands.\n- **Event 2**: Upon discovering the discrepancy, they move into a state of tension and risk, as their investigation could lead to professional and personal repercussions. Their condition becomes more precarious compared to the initial stability.\n- **Event 3**: With the revelation of their boss's corruption and the subsequent retaliation, Madison and Noah's situation worsens significantly. They face not only professional jeopardy but also physical danger, marking a low point in their condition.\n- **Event 4**: By securing evidence and deciding to expose the corruption, Madison and Noah take a significant risk but also embark on a path of moral redemption. Their condition starts to improve as they take control of their situation and stand up for what is right, despite the risks.\n- **Event 5**: After the exposure and the downfall of Two Peak Enterprises, Madison and Noah emerge as heroes and decide to leave the aggressive world of finance for a quieter life. This marks a significant improvement in their condition, as they achieve a form of personal and professional liberation, albeit with a note of suspense at the very end.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the narrative. Starting from a relatively stable and high point (successful careers and a budding romance), Madison and Noah fall into a dilemma (discovery of corruption and subsequent dangers) and then find a way out by taking a moral stand and exposing the truth. This leads to an ultimate improvement in their condition, as they transition to a new, presumably better life, leaving behind the corruption and stress of their previous world.\n\nThis pattern fits the **Man in a Hole** story arc, where the protagonist falls into a difficult situation but eventually recovers and ends up in a better state than where they began. The key elements are the initial fall into trouble (discovery of corruption and retaliation), the struggle to overcome it (investigation and moral stand), and the eventual rise to a better condition (exposure of truth and new life).\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To analyze the story arc, let's first identify the protagonist and major events in the story.\n\n1. **Protagonist Identification and Major Events**:\n   - The protagonist of the story is Emily Meyers.\n   - Five major events in the story are:\n     1. Emily learns she will be receiving the promotion (Event 5).\n     2. Luke's resentment over not being promoted leads to tensions in his relationship with Emily (Event 7).\n     3. Emily attempts to advocate more for Luke in the workplace, but it backfires (Event 12).\n     4. Emily receives a $575,000 commission check after a successful trade (Event 15).\n     5. Emily threatens Luke with a knife, demanding an apology for raping her, and eventually, Luke apologizes and leaves (Events 30-32).\n\n2. **Protagonist's State at Each Event**:\n   - **Event 5**: Emily's state improves significantly as she receives the promotion, indicating a rise in her professional status and potentially her personal confidence.\n   - **Event 7**: Emily's state begins to deteriorate as the tension in her relationship with Luke increases due to his resentment. This introduces a personal conflict that complicates her otherwise successful professional life.\n   - **Event 12**: Emily's state worsens both professionally and personally. Her attempt to help Luke backfires, leading to professional embarrassment and further strain on their relationship.\n   - **Event 15**: Emily's state improves professionally with the receipt of the commission check, indicating a peak in her career success. However, this event also marks a point where her personal relationship with Luke continues to deteriorate.\n   - **Events 30-32**: Emily's state hits a low point personally and professionally. She has been raped by Luke, her professional success is tainted by the knowledge that Luke accuses her of trading sexual favors for her promotion, and she is forced to confront the end of their relationship in a violent and traumatic manner.\n\n3. **Story Arc Classification**:\n   The story starts with Emily in a relatively good state, being in a secret relationship and having a promising career. She then experiences a significant professional rise with her promotion but faces personal and professional challenges as her relationship with Luke deteriorates and she faces complications at work. Despite achieving professional success (receiving the commission check), her personal life descends into violence and trauma, culminating in a dramatic confrontation with Luke. This pattern, where the protagonist starts in a relatively high state (in terms of personal relationship and career prospects), rises professionally but faces significant personal and professional setbacks, leading to a drastic downfall in personal terms, aligns with the **Riches to Rags** story arc type. The key characteristic of this arc is the overall decline from a high starting point to a lower ending point, both in personal and professional terms, despite temporary successes.\n\n4. **Determined Story Arc Type**:\nRiches to Rags"

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is the Slayer, an enigmatic figure known for his lethal abilities. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **The Assignment**: The Slayer receives a mission from Mr. X to assassinate El Patron (sentence 7).\n2. **The Confrontation with Maria**: The Slayer faces a heated confrontation with Maria, who is suspicious of his activities and pleas with him to abandon his deadly intent (sentence 21).\n3. **Maria's Kidnapping**: El Patron's entourage kidnaps Maria, drawing the Slayer into a personal feud (sentence 27).\n4. **The Rescue Mission**: The Slayer embarks on a mission to save Maria, leading to a confrontation with El Patron and his guards (sentence 29).\n5. **The Escape**: The Slayer and Maria escape the chaotic crime scene with the help of Officer Lopez and flee into the unknown (sentence 38).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **At the Assignment**: The Slayer is in a state of professional engagement, receiving a mission that aligns with his skills but also triggers memories of his past and his desire to leave it behind. His state is one of internal conflict but with a clear professional direction.\n- **At the Confrontation with Maria**: The Slayer's state worsens as he faces emotional turmoil. His relationship with Maria and her pleas for him to change his ways deepen his internal conflict, making his situation more complicated and emotionally challenging.\n- **At Maria's Kidnapping**: The Slayer's state becomes one of desperation and urgency. The personal nature of the conflict escalates his emotional investment, and he is driven by a desire for rescue and retribution.\n- **At the Rescue Mission**: The Slayer's state is one of determination and focus. Despite the risks, he is resolute in his mission to save Maria, indicating a peak in his emotional and professional commitment.\n- **At the Escape**: The Slayer's state improves as he and Maria escape, indicating a move towards a better situation. They are no longer in immediate danger, and there's a glimmer of hope for a new beginning, symbolized by their fleeing into the unknown.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, it can be observed that the Slayer starts in a situation of internal conflict due to his past and his relationship with Maria. As the story progresses, he faces a significant downturn with Maria's kidnapping, which complicates his situation and forces him into a dangerous rescue mission. However, he manages to rescue Maria, and they escape together, indicating an improvement in his situation from the start.\n\nThe story arc type that best fits this progression is the **Man in a Hole**. This is because the Slayer falls into a dilemma (Maria's kidnapping and the ensuing conflict) and finds a way out (rescuing Maria and escaping), ending in a better state than when he started (with hope for a new beginning with Maria). The **Man in a Hole** story arc is characterized by the protagonist's condition worsening before it improves, which aligns with the Slayer's journey from internal conflict, through desperation and danger, to eventual escape and the possibility of redemption.\n\n### 4.

hidden figures in the slum world of Corvinton.\n8) Unable to ignore a potential route away from life in the slums, Sammy, more anticipation than trepidation, stepped into a dingy, improvised boxing ring.\n9) Fueling his bouts with raw, desperate energy, Sammy started to rack up a trail of victories that only ensnared him deeper into the violent world of underground boxing.\n10) Mike Walsh, a once-famous prizefighter now overshadowed by lost opportunities and desolate dreams, observed Sammy's amateur boxing career from the tattered sidelines, seeing potential in the desperate boy.\n11) Throwing Sammy a lifeline, Mike offered him a mentorship in fighting.\n12) It was the promise of an opportunity for Sammy to escape the crushing poverty of the slums.\n13) However, this newfound direction in life was met with vehement resistance at home.\n14) Sammy's mother, Rhoda, emphasized that remaining part of this fighting world would only exacerbate their despair.\n15) Dismissing his mother's emotional pleas, Sammy committed himself to a course with Mike, creating a challenging mentorship that nurtured his raw capabilities into finesse.\n16) Through Mike's rigorous training and strategic insights, Sammy earned recognition beyond the slum, his natural talent refined into a formidable art.\n17) Each resounding victory in the boxing ring slowly tapered their past experiences of hunger and debt into vague memories, each subsequent fight win propelling them out of their destitution.\n18) But just when rays of hope began to penetrate their grim existence, life struck a devastating blow.\n19) Sammy's vivacious younger brother, Caleb, succumbed to a nasty bout with pneumonia.\n20) The high cost of medical intervention remained a far-off dream, even with Sammy's burgeoning fight earnings.\n21) Faced with this painfully harsh reality, Sammy found himself pushed to extremes, resorting to a perilous path in an attempt to save his brother.\n22) He signed up for a notoriously lethal boxing match with monumentally high stakes, its reputation known far beyond the underground circuits of Manhattan.\n23) Emerging from the barbaric match covered in blood, Sammy was not only severely injured but also penniless.\n24) He had lost the fight and his only chance to save Caleb.\n25) Adding to his woes, his devastating defeat cost him a golden opportunity at the statewide boxing heavyweight title.\n26) Carrying the burden of broken dreams and physical pain, Sammy trudged home to Rhoda, whose disappointment and sorrow were more wounding than any physical impairment.\n27) Sammy wagered everything and yet gained nothing - his prize money had evaporated, Caleb was nearing death, and his mother's faith in him was shattered.\n28) Drowning in guilt and despair one morning, he woke in their crumbling shack to the heart-shattering news - Caleb had lost his battle with pneumonia.\n29) The grim reality of his loss clouded Sammy's vision, making him question his future in boxing, the only solace he had from the realities of slum life.\n30) Confiding in Mike over his uncertainties, Sammy listened to Mike's tales of personal regret and the downward spiral that sank his promising career prematurely.\n31) The melancholic story stirred something within Sammy and sparked a reflection on his boxing career and personal life.\n32) Encouraged by his mother's disappointed pleas, comforted by prayers, Sammy returned to the worn-out gym, setting himself on a path of redemption and perseverance.\n33) Hours slipped into days, and days into weeks as Sammy once again immersed himself in training with renewed spirit and determination sparked by his loss.\n34) Ultimately, Sammy once again found himself under the dazzling lights of the statewide boxing arena, surrounded by a lively crowd buzzing with excitement.\n35) His cocky opponent, Steven \"Iron Knuckles\" Green - the arrogant reigning champion, was quick to belittle Sammy's humble origin, snidely dismissing Sammy's place in the ring with him.\n36) Provoked by the insults and the unfair reality of his circumstances, Sammy channeled his anger, his pain, his sorrow into the battle amid the electrifying atmosphere of the crowded arena.\n37) Their furious fists collided with explosive force, their unwavering spirits locked in a duel of dignity and determination - each aiming to claim the prestigious championship.\n38) The showdown was intense, pushing both fighters to their limits, testing their mental fortitude and physical stamina.\n39) Yet, against insurmountable odds, Sammy defied the impossible and emerged victorious.\n40) His win signified a redemption arc, a badge of resilience, and an unexpected rise to prominence.\n41) An unexpected hero of the Corvinton Slum, Sammy lifted the golden championship belt high, his eyes glistening with gratified tears reflected in the victory belt.\n42) In the crowd, his mother Rhoda was overcome with emotion.\n43) Her tears flowed freely down her worn-out face, rejoicing at her faith in Sammy, which had now been restored.\n44) Sammy, the boy once confined to fetching water in bare feet in the shanty, now basked in his triumph as a beacon of hope and embodiment of unyielding determination.\n45) Trampling over societal prejudices and expectations, Sammy demonstrated that one’s humble beginning doesn't dictate the future.\n46) His momentous victory was not solely his own.\n47) It represented Caleb's unfulfilled dreams, whose presence was deeply missed, yet felt with every victory lap.\n48) The laurels he earned extended beyond personal acknowledgment; it resonated within Rhoda, within the heart of every slum resident, within the contagious spirit of Caleb.\n49) The attained success brought fame, but more importantly, it created an avenue for financial security - a reality alien to his family's previous life.\n50) Sammy set aside a part of his winnings to establish The Caleb Foundation in honor of his late brother, ensuring that the children of the slum received proper education and a chance to break free from their cycle of poverty.\n51) Caleb's dreams found expression within others, his nonexistence marked by an enduring legacy invoked every time a slum child huddled over a textbook in the newly established learning center.\n52) With his newfound managerial status, Sammy started to lobby actively for improved facilities, including clean water and better healthcare services within the shanty.\n53) From a neglected street urchin moonlighting as a water carrier to an international icon serving as a beacon of hope, Sammy's trajectory was uplifting and inspiring.\n54) Upon reflection, he realized that boxing had not arisen chaos in his life, as his mother had anticipated; instead, it unveiled a world of untapped possibilities and transformative change.\n55) From his fresh intervention in a neighborhood clash to the thunderous applause filling the state's largest boxing arena, Sammy understood boxing was, indeed, his destiny.\n56) Amid the cacophony of adulation, Sammy clutched his championship belt, a triumphant tear escaping his eyes as he relished his sudden metamorphosis.\n57) No longer was he the overlooked barefoot boy wandering the rough streets of Corvinton, but was now a recognized face.\n58) Now standing tall as a heavyweight champion, Sammy wasn't just a beacon for the inhabitants of the shantytown, he became the shared voice of anyone who believed in his journey, sharing his struggles and dreams of victory.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better (e.g., 0→1→2→4→10)\n- Riches to Rags: Protagonist starts high and ends lower (e.g., 10→9→8→6→0)\n- Man in a Hole: Protagonist falls into trouble but recovers (e.g., 6→2→1→4→10)\n- Icarus: Protagonist rises then falls dramatically (e.g., 2→4→9→5→1)\n- Double Man in a Hole: Two cycles of fall and recovery (e.g., 6→2→7→4→10)\n- Cinderella: Rise, setback, ultimate triumph (e.g., 1→7→4→1→10)\n- Oedipus: Start high, fall, recover, final fall (e.g., 10→4→7→9→1)",

Classify the Story Arc Type\nThe story follows George Foreman through two major cycles of improvement and decline. Initially, he rises from a life of poverty and violence to become a successful boxer, which can be seen as the first \"man in a hole\" scenario where he improves his condition. However, he then falls into another dilemma due to his personal issues and losses, only to find his way out again through his spiritual transformation and eventual return to boxing, culminating in regaining his championship title. This pattern of falling into a dilemma, finding a way out, and then facing another dilemma before ultimately recovering and ending in a better state than where he started is characteristic of the **Double Man in a Hole** story arc.\n\n### 4.

Kevin finds Kaylee in the basement without eyes or a mouth, and the voice tells him it wants to play (sentence 19).\n5. Kevin inserst a knife into one of his eyes under the voice's command, and the story descends into chaos and surrealism (sentence 21).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Kevin's state changes from a normal, albeit injured, child to one facing an inexplicable and frightening situation as his house disappears. His condition worsens as he moves from a state of normalcy to one of fear and confusion.\n- **Event 2**: While this event initially seems to offer some resolution or comfort with the appearance of their parents, it ends in further disappearance and mystery, leaving Kevin (and Kaylee) in a state of heightened anxiety and uncertainty. Kevin's condition does not improve; if anything, the brief appearance of their parents only serves to deepen the mystery and fear.\n- **Event 3**: This event marks a significant point of terror for Kaylee, and by extension, Kevin, as the supernatural elements become more aggressive and personal. Kevin's state becomes one of heightened fear and protectiveness towards his sister, but overall, his condition worsens as the situation becomes more dire.\n- **Event 4**: Finding Kaylee in such a horrific state in the basement is a traumatic event for Kevin. His condition worsens significantly as he is faced with the reality of what has happened to his sister and the malevolent force at play. This event marks a point of no return in terms of Kevin's psychological and physical well-being.\n- **Event 5**: Kevin's decision to insert a knife into his eye under the voice's command signifies a complete breakdown of his psychological state and a severe deterioration of his physical condition. This act is a culmination of the horrific events he has endured, marking the lowest point in his condition throughout the story.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the progression of Kevin's state throughout the story, it's clear that his condition continuously worsens from the initial strange event to the final, horrific act. There is no significant improvement or recovery in his state; instead, each event contributes to a downward spiral of fear, trauma, and eventually, physical harm. This pattern aligns with the **Riches to Rags** story arc type, where the protagonist starts in a relatively better state (in this case, a normal life, albeit with an initial injury) and ends in a significantly worse state (traumatized, physically harmed, and psychologically broken).\n\n### 4.

        "input": "Story, broken down into numbered sentences:\n1) Sanjay Patel, affectionately known to everyone around him as \"Alex,\" is a smart and ambitious 16-year-old.\n2) Born in America and of Indian origin, he's a junior at a sports-oriented high school in Brooklyn, New York City.\n3) Despite not being much of a sports enthusiast, he struggles to fit into his school's hyper-athletic culture, while trying to stay true to his Indian heritage and himself.\n4) Allured by the graceful game of basketball, Alex secretly spends all his spare time in the gloomy, forsaken corners of the school's expansive indoor basketball court when no one is around.\n5) It is here that he studiously perfects his shots, dribbling skills, and layups while mentally absorbed in his world of idolized NBA legends.\n6) Fueled by isolated moments of surging confidence and spurred on by ambition, Alex audaciously attends the tryouts for his school's esteemed varsity basketball team.\n7) He surprisingly excels in the solo drills but his efforts are undermined by the scoffing and mocking from his naturally more robust, physically larger peers.\n8) In the midst of these unsettling high school trials and tribulations, Alex's traditional Indian family, who had moved from Mumbai a few years before Alex was born, find themselves relocating within Brooklyn due to a job opportunity for Alex's father.\n9) This places them next door to a foreboding figure known as Frank \"Walt\" Walter.\n10) Frank Walter, a towering white middle-aged male who happens to be an ex-NBA player, is an imposing figure around the neighborhood.\n11) His magnified reclusion has led everyone around him to believe he's a misanthrope.\n12) He busies himself with nursing unresolved past issues linked to an

training schedule, from refining fundamental shooting techniques to advanced strategic gameplay.\n18) Parallel to their training, the narrative gradually brings to light the extent of Walt's enigma—his sudden retirement from NBA due to a career-ending kneecap injury incurred during a potentially championship-winning game, which haunted him into isolation.\n19) As Walt begins to openly share his unspoken journey, his mentorship becomes more than just basketball training.\n20) It transforms into a life-lesson-packed experience, teaching Alex resilience, acceptance, and patience which coincidentally aids Walt to reconcile with his own buried past.\n21) The duo foster an unlikely bond mirrored by their shared love for basketball, comforted by the solace of their deserted indoor court.\n22) Walt slowly finds himself re-engaging with the community that he had distanced himself from, while Alex helps him with tasks such as grocery shopping and light cleaning around his neglected apartment.\n23) Six relentlessly arduous months later, a confident Walt finally convinces Alex to audition for the varsity basketball team again.\n24) This time, it won't be an act of mere audaciousness, but a show of his true unyielding potential.\n25) The day of the tryouts finally arrives.\n26) Thinking back to their countless hours of practice, drills, and shared wisdom, Alex courageously puts his best foot forward.\n27) He performs exceptionally well in the solo and team sessions, impressing everyone present.\n28) However, he is met with degrading racial discrimination from his predominantly white peers.\n29) His classmates jeer at his average height and unfamiliar Indian origins.\n30) However, the coach, a stern but fair man, sees the spark in Alex, valuing raw talent over narrow-minded bigotry, and boldly places him on the team's roster.\n31) An elated Alex further stuns his teammates and spectators with his stellar shooting skills and strategy in the inter-school matches, becoming the backbone for the team's winning streak—a testament to Walt's training and Alex's unwavering dedication.\n32) Amidst this upward trajectory, Alex goes through an unsettling episode during an away game.\n33) He suffers racial hostility from his own teammates.\n34) Heartbroken, he finds himself questioning if the passion for the sport he loves dearly is worth the constant struggle against cultural displacement and unwarranted hostility.\n35) Returning home desolate from the game, he confides his agonizing experience with Walt, who patiently listens to his young protégé's distress.\n36) Walt, having seen his fair share of bigotry, comments on the universality of their shared experiences.\n37) He became targeted after his career-ending injury and now Alex for his racial background.\n38) Walt imparts wisdom from his playing years, advising Alex to maintain his self-respect, disregard the harmful opinions of others, and to always put his heart and best efforts into the game.\n39) Walt's words provide a substantial morale boost, fortifying Alex's courage to confront not just his disparagers, but anyone who challenges his passion for the sport.\n40) Against all odds, he evolves into an invaluable player for his team.\n41) The day of the state championships arrive amidst this transformation.\n42) Despite the mixed feelings of excitement and anxiety, the team gears up for the final game.\n43) It's a nail-biting match, swinging back and forth between the competing teams.\n44) Adrenaline coursing through him, Alex pulls off

sport, applauding with pride in their hearts.\n47) His classmates, including those who once ridiculed him, are left in awe of his remarkable performance.\n48) This victory is a turning point; classmates who once derided him now admire him, and his team who once scorned him now cherish him.\n49) Alex’s victory party, held at a local community center, is a multicultural celebration attended by his Indian family, Walt, classmates and the entire basketball team.\n50) The tight-knit atmosphere and shared sense of accomplishment becomes a testament to unity and shared understanding.\n51) The next day at school, the air feels different.\n52) There's an elevated respect in the eyes of teachers and students alike, a newfound quietude that speaks loads about the shifted dynamics.\n53) In the frenzy of newfound social status at school and neighborhood, Alex remains humble, focused and with increased determination.\n54) His victory paves the way for new beginnings, not just for him but also for his school.\n55) Fueled by Alex's heroic win, it now aspires to cultivate a diverse sports environment.\n56) Change is noticeable even in Walt's life.\n57) The forgotten ex-NBA player transforms into an acclaimed mentor, admired for his efforts to guide a young talent towards an extraordinary triumph.\n58) Despite all these advancements, Walt and Alex continue to share precious hours on the court in training, relishing their shared victory.\n59) The storyline concludes with a quintessential Brooklyn sunset casting a warm glow on Alex, his parents, Walt and the basketball court.\n60) They

supposedly, it was an enchanted prison for a powerful and ill-tempered witch, captured by a wise shaman centuries before their time.\n30) Soon, whispers of Jane's encounter with the paranormal spread like wildfire around Silverint, their amicable townsfolk now treating her more skeptically, as if she were a magnet for unnatural energies.\n31) Jane found herself being treated differently.\n32) The food from the local diner had a strange, sour taste, and even Dash resorted to snarling every time she made an attempt to pet him.\n33) Distressed, lonely, and feeling the isolation more than ever, Jane yet refused to give in to the malevolent entity.\n34) Drawing upon her final reserves of energy, she fortified her resolve and swore to reclaim her peaceful life from the manifestations.\n35) Bearing her ordeal, Jane turned to Father Patrick, the town's well-respected priest and spiritual guide.\n36) She also sought help from Octavia, an elderly woman revered for her knowledge of historical lore and antiques, hoping to find a solution.\n37) They revealed to Jane an ancient local legend, a popular but largely untested folk tale about a mythical vault hidden deep within the heart of Thorne island.\n38) Folklore suggested that this vault contained magic powerful enough to reverse Jane’s chilling encounters.\n39) Octavia, glancing ominously at Jane, shared a puzzling clue: the vault would only make itself visible during the rare event of a lunar eclipse.\n40) This, she divulged, was to occur just the following night.\n41) High on nerves, Jane began her intense preparations as per the detailed rituals from Silverint's lore.\n42) She read ancient texts, memorized enchantments and mentally rehearsed the sacred rites necessary to combat the unseen enemy.\n43) Sensing her resolve, the vindictive spirit took a terrifying step.\n44) The peaceful tranquility of Jane's house ruptured into flames.\n45) Once a serene solace, her home now seemed to be a war zone, engulfed in an inferno and trying to consume her.\n46) Jane barely managed to escape the inferno, risked her life and dashed out into the darkness, only escaping with minor burns and a relentless spirit, fueled further by the desperate countermeasures the entity took.\n47) On the night of the lunar eclipse, armed with nothing but her courage and a series of chants, Jane set off into the eerie wilderness of Thorne, braving supernatural obstacles set by the vengeful spirit, towards the unseen vault.\n48) As she confronted the ghastly apparition, adrenaline coursing wildly through her veins, the only weapon she found she possessed was her  unwavering courage, resolute determination, and the disappearance of her previous reservations.\n49) With her relentless will, she fought and triumphed, successfully trapping the malevolent entity, trapping it back into the confines of the lustrous brass locket.\n50) She lodged the now dormant locket into an ancient stone niche within the concealed vault and sealed it shut, just as the last fragment of the lunar eclipse dissipated into the ebony sky.\n51) Life gradually began to find its way back to Jane.\n52) The town's folks' previously wary outlooks softened, Dash’s playful spirit resurfaced, and Jane began to see a glimmer of her old, tranquil life.\n53) Jane’s lifestyle morphed significantly in the succeeding days.\n54) She began to frequent Silverint more often and started to build forts of friendship with the once estranged townsfolk.\n55) Jane had gone from the reclusive 'island woman' to becoming a symbol of resilience, a beacon of courage and a testament to determination for the entire town.\n56) In conclusion, Jane is seen calmly watching the sun rise from her fixed up cabin porch, the sense of fulfillment and empowerment radiating from her was infectious, giving the audience a final sense of satisfaction after her considerable journey.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better (e.g., 0→1→2→4→10)\n- Riches to Rags: Protagonist starts high and ends lower (e.g., 10→9→8→6→0)\n- Man in a Hole: Protagonist falls into trouble but recovers (e.g., 6→2→1→4→10)\n- Icarus: Protagonist rises then falls dramatically (e.g., 2→4→9→5→1)\n- Double Man in a Hole: Two cycles of fall and recovery (e.g., 6→2→7→4→10)\n- Cinderella: Rise, setback, ultimate triumph (e.g., 1→7→4→1→10)\n- Oedipus: Start high, fall, recover, final fall (e.g., 10→4→7→9→1)",

Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1 (Sailing into Silverint)**: Jane's state is one of necessity and slight reluctance to engage with the outside world. She is still in control of her life and peaceful existence.\n- **Event 2 (Receiving the Locket)**: Jane's state becomes one of curiosity and slight unease, but she is still hopeful and intrigued by the possibility of the locket's power.\n- **Event 3 (The Locket's Influence)**: Jane's state deteriorates significantly as she experiences fear, confusion, and a loss of control over her life due to the paranormal events.\n- **Event 4 (Seeking a Solution)**: Jane's state is one of determination and desperation.

She has successfully overcome the darkness and is on the path to rebuilding her life, even improving it by engaging more with the community.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. Initially, Jane is in a peaceful state, then she falls into a dilemma with the introduction of the locket and its dark influence, and finally, she finds a way out of this hole by defeating the malevolent entity and reclaiming her life. This pattern of falling into a problem and then rising above it to an even better state than before matches the **Man in a Hole** story arc. The key characteristics of this arc are present: the protagonist starts in a good place, faces a significant challenge (the hole), and then emerges from this challenge in an even better state than before, having grown or changed positively.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To classify the story arc type, we first need to identify the protagonist and major events in the story.\n\n1. **Identify the protagonist and 5 major events:**\n   - The protagonist of the story is Lou, an ex-CIA field agent.\n   - Five major events in the story are:\n     1. Lou's initial introduction, where she's living a reclusive life with her dog Jax, dealing with arthritis (sentence 1).\n     2. The moment when Hannah interrupts Lou's suicide attempt, informing her that Vee is missing (sentence 8).\n     3. The revelation that Lou is an ex-CIA field agent and her subsequent actions to track down Philip and rescue Vee (sentence 13).\n     4. The confrontation at the beach where it's revealed that Philip is Lou's son, and she gets injured (sentence 18).\n     5. The final confrontation where Lou fights Philip, apologizes, and then both go under the water's surface as a CIA agent fires on them (sentence 25).\n\n2. **Describe the protagonist's state and how it changed:**\n   - **Event 1:** Lou is in a disadvantaged state, living as a loner and dealing with health issues.\n   - **Event 2:** Lou's state worsens as she's about to commit suicide, indicating a deep emotional or psychological low. However, this event also marks a turning point as she decides to act to help Hannah.\n   - **Event 3:** Lou's state improves significantly as she takes action, using her CIA skills to track down Philip. This shows a recovery and a sense of purpose.\n   - **Event 4:** Lou's state worsens again as she gets injured by her son and faces the consequences of her past actions.\n   - **Event 5:** Lou's final state is one of resolution and acceptance. She apologizes to her son, and her actions lead to a form of redemption, even though it ends in her apparent demise.\n\n3. **Classify the story arc type:**\n   - Given the pattern of Lou's state throughout the story, we see that she starts in a disadvantaged position (loner with health issues), falls into a deeper hole (suicide attempt), then rises as she takes action and uses her skills to help others, faces another downfall (injury and confrontation with her past), and finally ends in a state of resolution and redemption.\n   - This pattern matches the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc type because Lou falls into a dilemma (her initial reclusive state and subsequent suicide attempt) and finds a way out (taking action to help Hannah and confronting her past), ultimately ending in a better state emotionally (having found a form of redemption) than at the beginning, despite the physical outcome.\n\n4. **Determined story arc type:**\nMan in a Hole"

Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Introduction to John's High-Stakes Conversation** (Sentence 2-3): John is introduced, deeply engaged in a crucial phone call regarding his potential position as Managing Director within the Empire.\n2. **Emily's Investigation and John's Anxiety** (Sentence 5-7): Emily starts investigating John, leading to an increase in his anxiety levels as she probes into his personal and professional life.\n3. **Discovery of Threats to the Empire** (Sentence 10-12): John discovers mysterious letters and cryptic messages hinting at a danger shadowing the Empire, which further escalates his situation.\n4. **Confronting the Conspiracy** (Sentence 18-20): John confronts the mastermind behind the threats, and he and Emily decide to unite forces against their common enemy.\n5. **Resolution and New Beginning** (Sentence 21-25): John successfully uncovers the traitors, saves the Empire, and earns the position of Managing Director, marking a significant improvement in his condition.\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: John is in a state of high stakes, striving for a prestigious position. His condition is one of ambition and slight uncertainty.\n- **Event 2**: With Emily's investigation, John's state changes to one of increased anxiety and defensiveness, indicating a deterioration in his comfort and security.\n- **Event 3**: Upon discovering the threats to the Empire, John's state worsens as he faces not only personal scrutiny but also professional danger, plunging him into a deeper dilemma.\n- **Event 4**: When John decides to confront the conspiracy, his state begins to shift towards action and determination. Although he's still in a precarious situation, he's taking control, which is a step towards recovery.\n- **Event 5**: After resolving the conspiracy and achieving his goal, John's state improves dramatically. He's succeeded in his professional aspirations and has also gained respect and admiration, marking a significant positive change from his initial state.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the narrative. Initially, John is in a high-stakes situation but not necessarily in a bad state. He then falls into a deeper dilemma due to Emily's investigation and the discovery of threats to the Empire. However, he manages to find a way out of these problems by confronting the conspiracy and eventually succeeds in his goals, ending in a better state than where he started.\n\nThis pattern aligns with the **Man in a Hole** story arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma and then finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning. John's journey from facing personal and professional challenges to overcoming them and achieving success fits this archetype.\n\n### 4. Determined Story Arc Type\n\nMan in a Hole"

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\nThe protagonist of the story is Hal.

His state changes from submission back to an attempt at dominance.\n- **Event 3**: Hal's attempt at control is shattered by Rebecca's blackmail, leading to rage and humiliation. His state worsens, moving from attempted dominance back to a deeper submission and emotional distress.\n- **Event 4**: Hal hits a low point, realizing he cannot control Rebecca or the situation, and is forced into sexual acts against his will. His state is one of utter despair and loss of control.\n- **Event 5**: Through the roleplay, Hal finds a form of resolution and a new path forward with Rebecca, suggesting a reconciliation and a new dynamic in their relationship. His state improves, moving from despair to a form of acceptance and newfound understanding.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\nGiven the protagonist's condition throughout the story, it starts with Hal in a powerful position (about to become CEO), faces significant challenges and humiliations (especially during the blackmail and sexual coercion), and ends with a form of resolution and a new path forward. This pattern does not fit the \"Rags to Riches\" or \"Riches to Rags\" perfectly because Hal's journey is more complex, involving falls and recoveries. It doesn't fit \"Icarus\" because Hal doesn't rise to a peak of success before falling. The closest match is the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc because Hal falls into a deep dilemma (blackmail, humiliation, loss of control) but finds a way out through the final roleplay, ending in a better state than his lowest point. However, considering the complexities and the double cycle of dilemma and recovery (first, the initial submission and attempt to regain control, and second, the deeper fall into despair and the final recovery through the roleplay), it might also suggest elements of a \"Double Man in a Hole\" or a nuanced \"Cinderella\" story arc where the protagonist faces setbacks but ultimately achieves a higher state of being or understanding.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Sam Johnson, a former marine turned cybersecurity expert. Five major events in the story can be identified as follows:\n\n1. **Introduction to Sam's Skepticism**: Sam's initial skepticism towards the world's escalating dependence on androids, particularly with the unveiling of the new android model, Nemesis (sentences 4-6).\n2. **The Onset of Cyber Attacks**: The city's tranquility is shattered by ferocious cyber attacks, prompting Sam to investigate (sentence 7).\n3. **Discovery of Nemesis's Power**: Sam uncovers the terrifying and astonishing power of Nemesis to create clay minions that can imitate anyone (sentences 10-11).\n4. **Formation of the Future Force and First Victory**: Sam forms the \"Future Force\" and they achieve their first victory against the clay minions (sentences 12-19).\n5. **Final Battle and Victory Over Nemesis**: The final battle where the Future Force, led by Sam, defeats Nemesis using a code-virus (sentences 24-34).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: Sam is in a state of skepticism and concern about the reliance on androids. His condition is one of caution and vigilance.\n- **Event 2**: The cyber attacks introduce a significant challenge, placing Sam in a more urgent and dangerous situation. His condition worsens as he faces a considerable threat to the city and its inhabitants.\n- **Event 3**: Discovering Nemesis's power, Sam's situation becomes even more dire, as he now understands the magnitude of the threat. His condition is at a low point, faced with a powerful and dangerous enemy.\n- **Event 4**: With the formation of the Future Force and their first victory, Sam's condition improves significantly. He has found a way to counter the threat and has achieved a success, marking a turning point in his situation.\n- **Event 5**: The final victory over Nemesis represents the peak of Sam's condition in the story. He has solved the problem, saved the city, and found closure on his suspicions about Nemesis.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the narrative. Initially, Sam is in a cautious state, which worsens with the onset of cyber attacks and the discovery of Nemesis's powers. However, he then improves his situation by forming the Future Force, achieving victories, and ultimately defeating Nemesis. This pattern shows that Sam faces a significant dilemma (the threat of Nemesis and the cyber attacks) and finds a way out, ending in a better condition than where he started.\n\nThe story does not follow a \"Rags to Riches\" arc because Sam does not start in a completely disadvantaged position; he is already a skilled cybersecurity expert. It does not follow \"Riches to Rags\" because Sam's condition improves by the end. The \"Icarus\" pattern does not apply because Sam does not rise to a peak only to fall; instead, he overcomes challenges to achieve a victory. The \"Cinderella\" and \"Oedipus\" patterns also do not fit perfectly because Sam's story is more about overcoming external challenges rather than internal transformations or tragic downfalls.\n\nThe closest pattern is the \"Man in a Hole\" because Sam falls into a dilemma (the cyber attacks and Nemesis's threat) and then finds a way out, ending in a better condition. However, given the complexity and the specific classification provided, the story could be seen as following a \"Double Man in a Hole\" pattern if one interprets the formation of the Future Force and the first victory as a recovery, followed by another challenge (the final battle) and another recovery (the final victory). But based on the major events outlined, it more straightforwardly aligns with the \"Man in a Hole\" narrative, where the protagonist faces a problem, works to resolve it, and ends up in a better state.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story can be identified as Minh, Trini's daughter, as the story significantly revolves around her emotional journey, her desire to become a Power Ranger, and her ultimate involvement in the battle against Robo-Rita.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. **Trini's Death**: The story begins with Billy calling in the Power Rangers to fight Robo-Rita, resulting in Trini's vaporization (sentence 2).\n2. **Minh's Involvement**: Minh learns about her mother's fate and later wants to join the fight against Robo-Rita, feeling angry and left out when Billy and Zack don't want her involved (sentence 7).\n3. **Capture and Heroism**: Minh is captured by Robo-Rita but saves Billy by jumping in front of a blast, which bonds the morpher to her (sentences 19-22).\n4. **Battle Participation**: Minh, now a morphed Ranger, participates in the battle to destroy Robo-Snizzard and Robo-Rita, using the Megazord (sentences 24-25).\n5. **Victory Celebration**: The final scene shows Minh celebrating the victory with Billy and Zack, indicating her acceptance and integration into the Power Rangers family (sentence 27).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1 (Trini's Death)**: Minh's state is one of loss and grief, having just learned about her mother's death. This event sets her on a path of seeking involvement and justice.\n- **Event 2 (Minh's Involvement)**: Minh's state changes to one of frustration and determination. She wants to be part of the fight but is initially excluded, showing a desire to grow and contribute.\n- **Event 3 (Capture and Heroism)**: Minh's state shifts dramatically as she faces danger and makes a heroic sacrifice, marking a significant point of growth and acceptance by the Rangers.\n- **Event 4 (Battle Participation)**: Minh's state is one of empowerment and belonging. She is now a recognized member of the team, fighting alongside the other Rangers.\n- **Event 5 (Victory Celebration)**: Minh's state is one of joy, acceptance, and a sense of new beginnings. She has found her place among the Power Rangers and is moving forward from her grief.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the story. Minh starts in a disadvantaged situation (loss and grief), faces setbacks (frustration and exclusion), but ultimately ends in a much better state (empowerment, belonging, and joy). This pattern follows the **Man in a Hole** story arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (Minh's desire for justice and her mother's death) and finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning (Minh becoming a Power Ranger and finding her place).\n\n### 4.

He then rises with the help of Frederick and later Brenda, faces a setback due to Frederick's betrayal, but ultimately achieves a higher state of success and personal fulfillment. This pattern matches the **Cinderella** story arc type, where the protagonist rises, faces a setback, and ultimately achieves a higher state. The key elements of the Cinderella arc are present: the initial low point (facing rejection), the rise (meeting Frederick and succeeding at Tech Titans), the setback (Frederick's betrayal), and the ultimate achievement of a higher state (success with Brenda and the flagship store).\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Dexter Reed. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. Dexter's house burns down due to his invention failure (sentence 2).\n2. Dexter decides to work at Good Burger again (sentence 11).\n3. Dexter and Ed sign the contract with MegaCorp (sentence 16).\n4. Dexter and Ed discover MegaCorp's true intentions and the consequences of their contract (sentence 17).\n5. Dexter, Ed, and the Good Burger employees successfully stop the launch of Mega Good Burger and MegaCorp is shut down (sentences 29-31).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Dexter's house burns down):** Dexter is at a low point, having lost his home and business due to his invention's failure. This is one of the lowest points in his condition throughout the story.\n  \n- **Event 2 (Dexter decides to work at Good Burger again):** Dexter's condition has slightly improved as he now has a place to stay (with Ed) and a job, providing him with some stability and income. However, he is still far from his goal of becoming a successful entrepreneur.\n\n- **Event 3 (Dexter and Ed sign the contract with MegaCorp):** Dexter's condition seems to improve financially as he considers the potential benefits of the deal for himself and Ed. He believes this could be a step towards financial stability and success.\n\n- **Event 4 (Dexter and Ed discover MegaCorp's true intentions):** Dexter's condition worsens significantly as he realizes his mistake in signing the contract. The employees are to be fired, and Good Burger will lose its original charm. This is a setback for Dexter, both personally and in terms of his relationship with others.\n\n- **Event 5 (Dexter, Ed, and the Good Burger employees stop the launch of Mega Good Burger):** Dexter's condition improves dramatically. Not only does he help save Good Burger, but he also makes amends with his sister and niece. Additionally, Ed and Ed 2 figure out how to make permanent ice, which leads to a significant financial gain for Good Burger, indirectly benefiting Dexter.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the analysis of Dexter's condition throughout the story, it can be observed that he starts at a low point (losing his home and business), then experiences a series of ups and downs. Initially, he faces failure and rejection, which places him in a disadvantaged situation. As the story progresses, he finds some stability and considers opportunities for financial gain, which suggests an improvement in his condition. However, he then faces a significant setback with the discovery of MegaCorp's intentions, which worsens his condition. Finally, he ends the story on a high note, having helped save Good Burger, making amends with his family, and indirectly benefiting from the success of Good Burger.\n\nThe story arc that best fits this pattern is the \"Rags to Riches\" arc because Dexter starts in a disadvantaged situation (losing his home and business due to invention failures) and ends in a much better situation (having saved Good Burger, made amends, and indirectly benefiting from its success). Although he faces setbacks along the way, his overall trajectory from the beginning to the end of the story is one of improvement.\n\n### 4. Determined Story Arc Type\n\nRags to Riches"

        "output": "To classify the story arc type of the given story, we first need to identify the protagonist and key events in the narrative.\n\n1. **Identify the Protagonist and Major Events:**\n   - The story seems to focus on multiple characters, but if we had to identify a central figure around whom the story revolves, it could be argued that Frank, the young widower, is the protagonist due to his significant character development and emotional journey.\n   - Five major events in the story are:\n     1. Frank's struggle with sudden fatherhood and his introduction (sentence 5).\n     2. The decision to take a trip to Fiji, which is sparked during the Ohio State-Michigan football game (sentence 8).\n     3. The group's arrival in Fiji and the challenges they face, including a postponed flight and a tropical storm (sentences 14 and 17).\n     4. The climax of the story, where despite the storm, connections are made, and significant personal moments occur, such as Frank and Amanda finding connection and Sam serenading Olivia (sentence 21).\n     5. The group's return to San Francisco, realizing they have formed a bond that resembles a found family (sentence 27).\n\n2. **Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes:**\n   - **Event 1:** Frank is introduced in a state of struggle, coping with the loss of his wife and the challenges of being a new father. His condition is low due to grief and the difficulties of single parenthood.\n   - **Event 2:** The decision to go to Fiji represents a turning point where Frank begins to look for a way out of his current predicament, seeking escape and possibly a new beginning. His condition starts to improve slightly as he finds a distraction and potential for happiness.\n   - **Event 3:** In Fiji, despite the initial challenges, Frank is among people who care for him, and this social support starts to uplift him. However, the challenges they face could also be seen as a temporary setback.\n   - **Event 4:** The connections made during the storm signify a significant improvement in Frank's condition. He finds companionship and possibly love with Amanda, which is a major positive development.\n   - **Event 5:** By the end of the story, Frank has formed meaningful bonds with the people he traveled with, effectively creating a new family dynamic that supports him and his son. This marks a substantial improvement in his condition from the beginning of the story.\n\n3. **Classify the Story Arc Type:**\n   - The story follows Frank as he faces significant personal challenges (the loss of his wife and the struggles of single parenthood), then finds a path towards improvement and happiness through his journey to Fiji and the connections he makes there. This journey involves facing setbacks (such as the storm) but ultimately ending in a better state than where he began. The pattern of facing a dilemma, finding a way out, and ending better than at the start aligns with the **\"Man in a Hole\"** story arc. However, given the classification provided in the task as **\"Double Man in a Hole,\"** we must consider if there are two distinct cycles of dilemma and recovery. While Frank's story is primarily one of progression from a low point to a high point with challenges along the way, the classification of **\"Double Man in a Hole\"** suggests recognizing two phases of falling into a hole and climbing out, which might be a bit of a stretch based on the events outlined. The primary arc of improvement from grief and single parenthood to finding love and a new family structure is clear, but identifying two clear cycles of dilemma and recovery is less so.\n\n4. **Determined Story Arc Type:**\nDouble Man in Hole"

        "output": "### 1. Identify the protagonist and 5 major events in the story\n\nThe protagonist of the story is John Morrison. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Event 1: Introduction to Morrison's Life** (sentence 1-3) - Morrison is introduced as a charismatic figure working for Lion Hart International, but struggling with alcoholism in private.\n2. **Event 2: The Onset of the Financial Crisis** (sentence 4-6) - A global financial crisis hits, affecting Lion Hart and leading to layoffs, including Morrison's.\n3. **Event 3: Morrison's Investigation Begins** (sentence 9-11) - Morrison starts investigating Lion Hart's financial transactions, uncovering potential fraud and deciding to take action.\n4. **Event 4: Escalation and Personal Threats** (sentence 14-15) - Morrison's family becomes a target due to his investigation, escalating the situation and putting him in greater danger.\n5. **Event 5: Resolution and Redemption** (sentence 18-23) - Morrison's efforts lead to the exposure of Lion Hart's corruption, he rises as a beacon of truth, achieves sobriety, and becomes a national hero.\n\n### 2. Describe the protagonist's state and changes at each event\n\n- **At Event 1**, Morrison appears to be in a high-status position professionally but is struggling personally with alcoholism. His state is complex, with both success and hidden turmoil.\n- **At Event 2**, Morrison's state worsens as he loses his job due to the financial crisis, and his personal struggles with alcoholism are exacerbated by his professional downfall.\n- **At Event 3**, Morrison takes proactive steps to investigate and potentially expose Lion Hart's wrongdoings. This shows a shift towards empowerment and action, though his personal struggles continue.\n- **At Event 4**, Morrison faces increased danger and pressure as his family is threatened, indicating a further complication in his situation. However, this also seems to galvanize his resolve.\n- **At Event 5**, Morrison achieves a significant turnaround, succeeding in his mission to expose corruption, overcoming his alcoholism, and finding redemption and recognition on a national level.\n\n### 3. Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain the reasoning\n\nThe story arc of John Morrison can be classified based on how his condition changes throughout the narrative. Initially, Morrison is in a position of professional success but personal struggle (alcoholism). The financial crisis and subsequent events lead to a significant downfall (loss of job, resurgence of alcoholism, and personal threats). However, through his actions and determination, Morrison not only recovers from these setbacks but also achieves a higher state of being than where he started (becoming a national hero, overcoming alcoholism, and finding redemption).\n\nThis pattern does not fit the **Rags to Riches** arc perfectly because Morrison starts in a relatively high position (though with personal struggles). It also doesn't fit **Riches to Rags** since he ends in a better state than he began. The **Man in a Hole** arc is closer because Morrison falls into a dilemma (job loss, alcoholism, personal threats) and then finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning. However, considering the complexity of his journey, which involves not just a fall and a rise but also a transformation from a private struggle to public recognition and redemption, it suggests elements beyond a simple recovery.\n\n### 4.

She starts to manage her tasks and shows a professional approach, indicating a rise in her condition.\n- **Event 4**: The discovery of the conspiracy leads to a moral and ethical dilemma for Sarah, causing internal conflict and a potential decline in her state as she grapples with what to do.\n- **Event 5**: Sarah's decision to act against the conspiracy and her subsequent actions lead to a dangerous and uncertain outcome. While she succeeds in thwarting the coup and escapes, her life becomes more precarious, and she is forced into hiding. This could be seen as a mixed outcome - she achieves her goal but at a significant personal cost, leading to a state of constant vigilance and danger.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the progression of Sarah's state throughout the story, it starts with her in a position of strength and skill, then declines significantly as she faces personal demons, rises as she finds a new path and purpose, but ultimately ends in a state of danger and uncertainty after making a stand against the conspiracy. This pattern reflects a story arc where the protagonist rises to a challenge, faces a significant setback, and then experiences a dramatic fall or significant change in circumstances.\n\nThe initial classification provided is **Icarus**, which typically involves a protagonist rising to success but then facing a drastic downfall. However, considering Sarah's journey from a state of strength, to a low point, to a rise, and then to a final state of uncertainty and danger, it seems more aligned with a story arc that involves a rise, a fall, and then another significant challenge or change.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Ava Faulkner, a recovering addict and former soldier turned assassin. Five major events in the story are:\n- Event 1: Ava kidnaps her new target, an English businessman, and questions him before planning to kill him (sentences 1-3).\n- Event 2: Ava visits her estranged sister Judy and her mother Bobbi in Boston after a job (sentence 5).\n- Event 3: Ava's handler, Duke, sends her to Saudi Arabia for a job that goes wrong, leading to a gunfight (sentences 7-10).\n- Event 4: Ava discovers that her handler, Duke, has been killed by his superior, Simon, and she receives a video of the murder (sentences 21-23).\n- Event 5: Ava confronts and kills Simon after he attempts to kill her (sentences 26-30).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: At the beginning, Ava is in control, operating as a skilled assassin. Her condition is one of power and independence.\n- **Event 2**: When Ava visits her family, her state shifts to one of vulnerability and personal connection, showing a softer side beyond her professional persona.\n- **Event 3**: After the botched operation in Saudi Arabia, Ava's state becomes one of caution and self-preservation, highlighting the risks and unpredictability of her profession.\n- **Event 4**: Upon learning of Duke's betrayal and murder, Ava's state deteriorates to one of grief, anger, and a sense of betrayal, marking a significant low point in her emotional and professional life.\n- **Event 5**: Finally, when Ava confronts and kills Simon, her state is one of determination and empowerment, as she takes control of her situation and seeks justice for Duke's death.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story does not follow a straightforward **Rags to Riches** or **Cinderella** arc, as Ava's condition does not consistently improve from the start to the end. It also does not fit the **Riches to Rags** pattern, as Ava starts in a complex state of being a skilled but troubled assassin and ends in a state of having overcome significant challenges, albeit still being stalked. The **Icarus** pattern does not apply because Ava does not rise to a peak of success before falling; instead, she navigates a series of challenges without a clear ascent. The **Oedipus** pattern is also not a good fit because Ava does not start in a high state and then fall twice. The **Double Man in a Hole** could be considered, given Ava's multiple dilemmas and recoveries, but the most fitting seems to be **Man in a Hole**, as Ava faces numerous challenges (being targeted, Duke's betrayal, personal relationship issues) and finds a way out, ending in a state of having resolved some of her issues but still facing threats.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Tork, the eldest member of the tribe. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **The Tribe's Departure**: The tribe, led by Tork, sets forth on a journey inspired by a grand vision (sentence 6).\n2. **Discovery of the Leviathan**: The tribe discovers an enormous, ancient fossil named 'The Leviathan' on their new beachfront home, which initially brings them anxiety (sentence 10).\n3. **Decision to Confront or Flee**: Tork and the tribe are faced with the decision to either confront their fears and the unseen tribe or flee, which marks a turning point in their journey (sentence 21).\n4. **The Battle with the Leviathan**: Tork leads the charge against the monstrous Leviathan, and after an initial victory, the beast retreats into deeper waters (sentences 26-30).\n5. **Achieving Unity and Harmony**: The tribes decide to live in harmony with the Leviathan and with each other, marking a significant step in their survival journey and societal evolution (sentence 34).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (The Tribe's Departure)**: Tork's state is one of leadership and vision. He has inspired his tribe to move towards a new home based on a prophecy, indicating a high level of influence and purpose.\n- **Event 2 (Discovery of the Leviathan)**: Tork's state changes to one of concern and uncertainty. The discovery of the Leviathan introduces a new, unforeseen challenge that tests his leadership and the tribe's resolve.\n- **Event 3 (Decision to Confront or Flee)**: Tork's state is one of resolve and strategic thinking. He must make a crucial decision that will affect the tribe's future, showing his ability to adapt and lead under pressure.\n- **Event 4 (The Battle with the Leviathan)**: Initially, Tork's state is one of courage and determination as he leads the battle. However, when the Leviathan resurfaces, causing panic, his state momentarily shifts to one of uncertainty before he and the tribe realize the beast is not a predator.\n- **Event 5 (Achieving Unity and Harmony)**: Tork's state is one of wisdom and accomplishment. He has led his tribe not only to survive but to thrive and find harmony with their environment and another tribe, achieving a higher level of societal evolution.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, the story arc can be classified by examining the trajectory of Tork's state from the beginning to the end. Tork starts in a position of leadership and vision, faces challenges and uncertainties (such as the discovery of the Leviathan and the decision to confront or flee), and ultimately achieves a higher state of unity, harmony, and societal evolution. This pattern, where the protagonist rises, faces a setback, and then achieves an even higher state, aligns with the **Cinderella** story arc type. In this arc, the protagonist's condition improves significantly from the start to the end, with setbacks serving as catalysts for growth and ultimate success.\n\n### 4.

Her situation changes as she becomes more involved in the group's dynamics due to the crisis.\n   - **Event 2 (Adem's death and cannibalism):** Beyah's state shifts as she takes a significant action (suggesting cannibalism) that shows her willingness to do whatever it takes to survive, potentially increasing her influence or changing her status within the group.\n   - **Event 3 (Beyah's escape from sacrifice):** Beyah falls into a deeper hole as she is targeted and has to fight for her life, but she manages to escape, which is a turning point where she begins to take more control of her situation.\n   - **Event 4 (Discovery of the Neanderthal):** Beyah's state improves as she discovers the truth about the Neanderthals, which could lead to a better understanding of their world and potentially safer conditions.\n   - **Event 5 (Killing the Neanderthal and reflection):** Beyah's state changes again as she kills to protect herself and Heron, and later reflects on her actions, showing growth and a different perspective on her situation and the world around her.\n\n3. **Classify the story arc type:**\n   - The story can be seen as a **Double Man in a Hole** because Beyah faces at least two significant dilemmas (being targeted for sacrifice and facing the Neanderthals) from which she recovers, ending in a better state than where she started. Initially, she is part of a starving, ragtag group with a low ranking. Through her experiences, especially after Heron's abduction and Adem's death, she faces numerous challenges but manages to survive and eventually find a new home with Heron. Her condition improves significantly from the start, where she was on the brink of starvation and had a low status, to the end, where she has found a new place to live and has taken on a more significant role in ensuring her and Heron's survival.\n\n4. **Determined story arc type:**\nDouble Man in a Hole"

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Jane Smith, a 36-year-old single mother. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Jane discovers the high cost of the drug for Ava's epilepsy treatment** (sentence 10): This event marks a significant downturn in Jane's situation as she realizes the financial burden of Ava's treatment.\n2. **Jane decides to participate in the 'San Diego Sings' competition** (sentence 19): This event shows Jane's determination to improve her and Ava's situation, marking a point where she takes action towards a better life.\n3. **Jane loses her job at the laundromat due to her commitment to the competition** (sentence 21): This event represents a low point for Jane, as she faces financial instability and increased stress.\n4. **Ava suffers a severe seizure, prompting Jane to work harder for the competition** (sentence 23): This event, while tragic, serves as a motivator for Jane, showing her resilience and determination to secure Ava's treatment.\n5. **Jane wins the 'San Diego Sings' competition and secures the money for Ava's treatment** (sentence 37): This event marks a significant improvement in Jane's situation, as she achieves her goal of securing Ava's treatment and improves their financial stability.\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1 (sentence 10):** Jane's state is one of despair and hopelessness upon learning the cost of Ava's treatment. Her situation worsens compared to the initial state where she was managing despite the challenges.\n- **Event 2 (sentence 19):** Jane's decision to participate in the competition shows a shift towards optimism and proactivity. Her state improves slightly as she sees a potential way out of their financial and medical woes.\n- **Event 3 (sentence 21):** Losing her job puts Jane in a more vulnerable state, with increased financial stress and uncertainty about the future. This event marks a downturn in her situation compared to when she had a steady, albeit low-paying, job.\n- **Event 4 (sentence 23):** Ava's severe seizure motivates Jane, but it also represents a low point in their lives due to the immediate health concerns. Jane's state is one of heightened urgency and determination.\n- **Event 5 (sentence 37):** Winning the competition dramatically improves Jane's state. She achieves financial stability, secures Ava's treatment, and finds a new career path. This marks a significant improvement in her situation, not just a return to the initial state but an advancement to a better life.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc of Jane Smith follows a pattern where she starts in a disadvantaged situation, faces numerous challenges and setbacks, but ultimately ends in a significantly better state. This pattern aligns with the **Rags to Riches** story arc, where the protagonist's condition improves from the beginning to the end, despite facing setbacks along the way. Jane's journey from struggling to make ends meet and secure her daughter's medical treatment to winning a competition, achieving financial stability, and finding a fulfilling career, exemplifies this arc. Her state at the end is not just improved but elevated beyond her initial circumstances, fitting the definition of a **Rags to Riches** story arc.\n\n### 4.

occupation.\n2) Running a thriving car dealership, he shares this venture and life's numerous pleasures and difficulties with his remarkably driven wife, Sarah.\n3) Their blissful existence unfolds against the pristine backdrop of Selton, a charmingly serene middle-class suburban neighborhood.\n4) This tight-knit community, with its verdant greenery, white picket fences, and friendly faces, is home to their trio of sparkling-eyed children; Lily, whose beautifully nimble fingers vividly bring alive any piano composition, Samuel who dominates lacrosse fields, and Zac, their youngest, whose infectious smile can brighten even the gloomiest of days.\n5) Everything seemed to follow a picturesque rhythm till one unusually warm Wednesday.\n6) Tom noticed a large, luminously painted moving van blocking their once-tranquil street.\n7) The van, plastered with cheerful imagery and parked in front of the Victorian style house next door, caused Tom a hint of anxiety.\n8) Lo and behold, this anxiety magnified into a feeling of discomfort and dread once he discovered that the new occupants of the neighboring house were none other than his high school nemesis, Dan.\n9) A former local football legend, Dan had always been known for his cocksure attitude and reputation for thriving in rivalries.\n10) Every casual interaction with Dan since then seemed soaked with an underlying animosity.\n11) Be it chance meetings at parental school functions or during the neighbor's backyard barbeque get-togethers, their conversations were invariably simmering with unsaid rivalry, hidden behind false smiles and forced laughter.\n12) More disconcertingly, Tom comes to realize that Dan's return isn't merely a personal upset, but also a professional threat.\n13) Dan, now a dealer specializing in coveted, high-end luxury vehicles, was not-hesitating to indirectly disparage and undermine Tom’s hard-earned business reputation.\n14) This festering relationship with Dan didn't just perturb Tom.\n15) It left him in a precarious spot when Dan began employing underhanded tactics, such as disseminating malicious rumors about Tom’s professional credibility, to sabotage his business.\n16) Feeling progressively cornered by the unpleasant circumstances, Tom finally confided in Sarah during a quiet, reflective conversation over a peaceful evening embellished with their favorite coffee.\n17) Sarah, erudite, and shrewd, proposed a strategical approach to counteract these swirling controversies.\n18) She drew up a plan to host a grand neighborhood car show, a casual gathering yet a serious platform to showcase Tom's diverse and impressive array of vintage and modern vehicles.\n19) Thrilled yet anxious, the couple decided to use the pride of Selton, the Faith Park, a shared open space in the heart of their community, as the venue for this ambitious event.\n20) Parallelly, as the car show preparations brewed, Tom and Dan's petty antagonisms escalated during casual neighborhood gatherings.\n21) Their constant one-upmanship, which began as minor, harmless jabbing, started taking on more worrying undertones.\n22) Confronting and gradually overcoming this opposition had an overpoweringly positive effect on Tom.\n23) It steeled his resolve and strengthened his courage to weather any adverse winds that Dan seemed determined to conjure and blow his way.\n24) Finally, the much-awaited day of the car show dawned, albeit with ominous rain clouds roiling the sky.\n25) To add to the mounting stress, their star attraction, a suave 1930 Ford Model A Roadster, was nonchalantly refusing to start.\n26) Fearful for his professional image and credibility, Tom spent the morning under the temperamental car in a makeshift garage.\n27) With the determination of a warrior, armed with tools as his weapons, he warred with the Roadster's obstinacy.\n28) Amidst this electrifying chaos, baby Zac suddenly vanished.\n29) A wave of panic washed over the Harpers as they frantically began looking for their youngest.\n30) As it turns out, the little one was found cozily snuggled asleep inside the plush leather seats of a cherry-red 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air.\n31) This discovery resulted in collective sighs of relief and subsequent laughter rippling through the family.\n32) With all minor mishaps resolved, and the stubborn rain deciding to stay at bay, the Harpers finally kick-started their car show.\n33) It turned into a fanfare of beautiful automobiles ranging from an imposing Rolls Royce Phantom to an agelessly charming Volkswagen Beetle.\n34) Amidst all the glitz and gasps of awe, what stood out was Tom's impressive command over automobiles.\n35) His expertise clearly overshadowed the petty, underhanded tactics that Dan had engaged in, affirming Tom's status as Selton's undisputed autophile.\n36) The success story of the day was the unanticipated support and acceptance from the community.\n37) This overwhelming display of solidarity promptly dismissed Dan's attempts at sabotage and heartened a now-relieved Tom.\n38) This realization and reaffirmation of his credibility and position galvanized Tom's self-confidence.\n39) It helped him understand that his authentic passion, practical knowledge, and deep domain understanding were invaluable competencies that set him apart in the industry.\n40) In a surprising twist of the narrative, the once-ruthless Dan openly admitted his wrongdoings and praised Tom on his unparalleled collection, conceding defeat over his own luxury line-up.\n41) His unexpectedly candid and humble admittance was the finishing touch to the success of the car show, bringing a sense of closure and redemption to the narrative.\n42) As the days rolled into weeks, the neighborhood transformed as the bricks of antagonism fell apart.\n43) It was replaced by a bloom of improved relations and a shared sense of harmony.\n44) The metaphorical picket fences that had sprung up between the red brick houses and bespoke maple-lined streets of Selton had, at last, vanished.\n45) Reflecting on the event, Tom recognized his triumph was not in trouncing Dan, but in the growing closeness within his family, and the strength of their relationship with their supportive neighbors.\n46) The closing scene elegantly captures Selton at dusk, with twinkling fairy lights adorning the entire neighborhood, mirroring the canopy of glistening stars overhead.\n47) The Harper family, stronger than ever, looked towards this future, filled with hope and excitement.\n48) Their journey, undeniably difficult, had ultimately been one of collective growth and unity.\n49) As fading laughter and lingering cheers accompanied a warm sense of fulfillment, the narrative underscored the fundamental values of unity, camaraderie, resilience, and the power to navigate and overcome adversities.\n50) The realization that their resilience and community support far overshadowed any vendetta brought a new perspective to their lives.\n51) It was a framework much stronger and more uplifting than what they had believed possible.\n52) Thus, the warmly twinkling lights of Selton faded out, leaving behind an elegant tapestry of suburban life - whimsical, joyful, and infinitely stronger together.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better

Identify the protagonist and 5 major events in the story\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Maria, a woman who has withdrawn into solitude in a charming Victorian dwelling. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. The arrival of Jacob, a renowned author, in Millbrook, which sparks his curiosity about Maria (sentence 3).\n2. Jacob's initial attempts to forge a bond of friendship with Maria, who is hesitant due to years of isolation (sentence 6).\n3. The gradual erosion of Maria's defenses and the beginning of a foundation of friendship between Maria and Jacob (sentence 7).\n4. Maria's sharing of her painful past with Jacob, including the loss of loved ones and betrayal, and her transcendence of inhibitions and guilt (sentences 18-19).\n5. The conclusion of the story, where Maria finds comfort, acceptance, and hope in her friendship with Jacob, and her journey from sorrow to an inspiring survivor is revealed (sentences 32-36).\n\n### 2. Describe the protagonist's state at each event and how it changed\n\n- **Event 1 (Jacob's arrival):** Maria's state is one of solitude and isolation, with a hint of mystery surrounding her past. Her condition is static at this point, as Jacob's arrival has not yet impacted her.\n- **Event 2 (Initial attempts at friendship):** Maria is hesitant and guarded, indicating her state is still one of isolation, but there's a slight crack in her defenses due to Jacob's approach. Her condition is slightly more open but still cautious.\n- **Event 3 (Erosion of defenses):** Maria's state begins to shift more significantly as she starts to open up to Jacob. Her condition improves as she begins to form a connection, moving from isolation towards friendship.\n- **Event 4 (Sharing her past):** Maria's state is one of vulnerability but also of liberation. By sharing her painful experiences, she transcends her guilt and inhibitions, marking a significant improvement in her emotional state. Her condition has improved substantially as she finds relief and understanding.\n- **Event 5 (Conclusion):** Maria's state is one of hope, joy, and newfound peace. She has transitioned from a life of solitude and sorrow to one where she finds comfort and acceptance in her friendship with Jacob. Her condition has improved dramatically from the beginning of the story.\n\n### 3. Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain the reasoning\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on the pattern of the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. In this case, Maria starts in a disadvantaged situation (solitude and sorrow) and ends in a much better one (hope, joy, and peace). This pattern matches the \"Rags to Riches\" story arc, where the protagonist's condition improves from the start to the end of the story. The key characteristic of this arc is the upward trajectory of the protagonist's fortunes or emotional state, which is evident in Maria's journey from isolation and pain to connection and peace.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identification of Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is the band Doomstar, specifically focusing on their journey as a collective entity. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **The Announcement of the Band's Break**: When Joshua announces the band's temporary break to explore individual compositions (sentence 3).\n2. **The Transition to a Dystopian World**: When the band is transported to a world devoid of music after the Aztec amulet's activation (sentence 6).\n3. **The Discovery of the Masked Slayer and the Harmony Crystal**: When the band learns about their enemy and the source of the world's silence (sentences 11-13).\n4. **The Retrieval of the Harmony Crystal**: When the band successfully retrieves the Harmony Crystal from the Masked Slayer's fortress (sentence 22).\n5. **The Final Concert and Victory**: When the band performs a concert that defeats the Masked Slayer and liberates music in the world (sentence 26).\n\n### 2. Description of Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1 (The Announcement)**: The band is at a high point, performing successfully and announcing a break to explore individual creativity. Their state is one of excitement and anticipation for new musical ventures.\n- **Event 2 (The Transition)**: The band's state drastically changes to one of shock, confusion, and despair as they find themselves in a dystopian world without music. This is a significant downturn.\n- **Event 3 (The Discovery)**: The band's state evolves from mere survival to a sense of purpose as they learn about the Masked Slayer and the Harmony Crystal. They are determined but face significant challenges.\n- **Event 4 (The Retrieval)**: The band experiences a surge in morale and capability as they successfully retrieve the Harmony Crystal. This marks a significant improvement in their state as they gain the tool necessary to challenge the Masked Slayer.\n- **Event 5 (The Final Concert)**: The band reaches a peak state of unity, determination, and power as they use the Harmony Crystal to defeat the Masked Slayer and restore music to the world. This is the highest point in their journey.\n\n### 3. Classification of Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified by examining the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. Initially, the band is in a high state (successful performance), then they fall into a dilemma (transported to a dystopian world), and subsequently, they find a way out of this hole (defeating the Masked Slayer and returning home). This pattern suggests a **Man in a Hole** story arc, where the protagonist falls into a problem and then recovers, ending in a better state than where they began.\n\nHowever, considering the specific classification provided and the details of the story, the narrative also exhibits characteristics of a **Double Man in a Hole** story arc. The band faces two significant downturns: the first when they are transported to the dystopian world, and a second, less intense downturn when they face internal conflicts and the challenge of retrieving the Harmony Crystal. Each of these downturns is followed by a recovery, with the final recovery leading to their ultimate victory and return home.\n\nGiven the provided classification of **Double Man in a Hole** and analyzing the protagonist's journey, it's reasonable to conclude that this classification fits the narrative's pattern of the band facing multiple challenges, recovering from each, and ultimately achieving a triumphant conclusion.\n\n### 4.

tour and music.\n2) While the rest of the band have no recollection of the actual rescue, Nathan is suffering from post-traumatic stress from the experience and Magnus Hammersmith's suicide, while Toki has emotionally regressed to a child-like state as a coping mechanism.\n3) This results in him passing out during their first performance back together and all plans being indefinitely paused while he recovers at Mordhaus.\n4) During a memorial service for Ishnifus Meaddle, Charles Offdensen (now leader of the Church of the Black Klok) tasks Nathan with writing the \"Song of Salvation\" to prevent the Doomstar from destroying the Earth and allowing Mr Salacia to become whole again, but Nathan declines, choosing to settle down with Abigail.\n5) However, Abigail declines his proposal.\n6) After a confrontation with fans who witnessed it, Nathan ultimately decides to focus on his music, and the band head to a secret location under the guidance of Dick Knubbler.\n7) Meanwhile, General Crozier has been temporarily freed from control by Mr Salacia while he attempts to possess another, as he can only possess one person at a time.\n8) Now aware of what the Tribunal's true motives are, Crozier attempts to get a message out, but is stopped by Vater Orlaag before Salacia regains control.\n9) It turns out that the other person Salacia is attempting to possess is William Murderface, who experiences disturbing and painful hallucinations as Salacia takes control and influences him to damage Nathan's confidence and prevent the Song of Salvation from being written, as well as revealing the location of the Army of the Doomstar.\n10) At the end of their training and a drug induced meeting between Nathan and the Whale Prophet, the band begin performing the Song of Salvation.\n11) However, as they begin, Nathan realises that this is the wrong song.\n12) During their performance of \"Aortic Desecration\", the Doomstar approaches Earth and begins the Metalocalypse, destroying monuments across the planet and killing millions.\n13) The US Army and the Tribunal's own militia then attack the band's location, wiping out the Army of the Doomstar and killing Knubbler.\n14) During the attack, Crozier is able to free himself of Salacia's control for good while Murderface flees, still possessed and blaming himself for sabotaging the band's attempt to save the world.\n15) Crozier offers his help to the band as Skwisgaar, still in shock from the attack, is able to reveal Murderface's possession to the others.\n16) Crozier tells the band how to free him from Salacia and the band forgive him for what happened, given that he was not in control of his actions, explaining that he belongs in the band as he brings balance to the group with his negativity.\n17) Realising what they now need to do, Dethklok and Crozier reconvene with Edgar Jomfru to perform the correct Song of Salvation, \"SOS\", but during their performance, Vater Orlaag orders an attack on the group.\n18) Dethklok are captured by Salacia and, after Nathan refuses Salacia's offer to join him, the five are hooked up to the supercomputer Salacia built to draw in the Doomstar.\n19) This allows Salacia to draw on the power of the Doomstar and commence the \"Great Reuniting\", becoming whole once more, but Nathan is able to break free of his restraints and break the computer long enough for the rest of the band to break free.\n20) Jomfru and Crozier infiltrate the facility, with Jomfru planting a bomb to destroy the supercomputer while Crozier attempts to regain control of the US military.\n21) Jomfru is killed, but not before successfully activating the bomb.\n22) The band are joined by Offdensen, the Church of the Black Klok, and their legions of fans, and fight the Tribunal's forces and the US Army while Vater Orlaag fights Offdensen.\n23) Just as Orlaag is about to kill Offdensen, he is distracted by Murderface, allowing Offdensen to recover and kill Orlaag.\n24) Crozier manages to regain control of the US military and orders them to stand down and assist the fans, apprehending the Tribunal's forces.\n25) However, Salacia emerges from his coccoon in his true form, killing many of the people on the battlefield.\n26) As he attempts to kill Dethklok, Nathan draws on the power of the Doomstar himself to counter Salacia's attacks.\n27) The band's power spreads to the legions of fans, amplifying their power and forcing Salacia to \"Go into the Water\", where he is finally killed by the Whale Prophet.\n28) Addressing their fans in the aftermath, Nathan realises that the fans are the true Army of the Doomstar, and that their new relationship with their fans is the true \"Great Reuniting\".\n29) The group and fans celebrate as the movie ends.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to

across the room with his baton.\n12) Bruce picks up Blade to hit him again but Blade uses his eye spikes to impale Bruce's hand, which causes him to smack Blade against a wall, which only causes the spikes to go in further.\n13) Blade manages to break free and musters enough strength to impales Bruce's ankle with his hook and drag him across the room and then finishes him off by sawing his head off violently with his knife.\n14) During this time Elisa is at home dreaming of these events as they play out and she feels a jolt of power every time Blade's knife is used, which reveals a psychic link between the two.\n15) Later on Gloria Vasquez, a Spanish nationalist spy and her henchman break into Elisa's apartment and tare the place apart looking for Blade and the scroll of Osiris.\n16) They manage to find the scroll hidden behind a painting and then she uses a special chemical to put press photographer Barney Barnes to sleep and take him back to be experimented on by Hauser.\n17)

without any sign of injury and followed Gloria to Hauser's secret hideout.\n18) Meanwhile, Madison used a smoke bomb at the Daily Herald to knock Elisa and detective Joe Gray unconscious and also take them back to the hideout and Blade was already there and hiding behind a shelf.\n19) Joe is chained up on the ceiling and his leg is broken with a wrench and Elisa is strapped to a torture device and repeatedly electrocuted and asked to hand over the translation of the scroll of Osiris, as Hauser was unable to do it himself as he did not understand Russian, Greek and Egyptian symbols, he also reveals that he plans to uses a giant Death Ray on the roof to shoot out a signal which will kill half the population of California and then revive them as murderous zombies that will follow orders from the Nazi regime.\n20) Elisa refuses and is continued to be electrocuted with the torture device but she uses her psychic bio-energy to shut the machine down.\n21) After this Blade cuts Joe down from his chain and systematically goes on a killing spree across the hideout and he begins by putting his hook into the mouth of one of the henchman and cutting him in the back of the head and slitting his throat.\n22) He then is fired at by Lang's gun but each bullet misses and Blade finishes him off with a few stabs to the throat.\n23) Hauser then uses his machine to transform Barney into

the inside.\n32) This causes the ray and the hideout to explode and Blade, Elisa and Joe manage to escape unharmed.\n33) After this Elisa prints a story about a killer puppet foiling a Nazi death plot in her newspaper article and because the Daily Herald is known for printing fictitious tabloid headlines then it is not believed by the public.\n34) After this Joe uses Blade to climb through the vent

Five major events in the story can be identified as follows:\n\n1. **Event 1: Introduction to John's Life** - John is thriving in New York City as a successful stockbroker.\n2. **Event 2: Forced Move to Smallville** - John is suddenly moved to Smallville, a quaint agricultural hamlet, where he struggles to adjust.\n3. **Event 3: Discovery of the Treasure Map** - John finds an old blueprint that hints at a treasure buried in the nearby Appalachian Range, sparking his interest and giving him a new goal.\n4. **Event 4: Successful Treasure Hunt** - Despite initial skepticism and challenges, John successfully finds the treasure with the help of the mythical guardian, marking a significant achievement.\n5. **Event 5: Integration into Smallville** - John uses his newfound wealth to modernize the farm, earns the respect and acceptance of the townspeople, and finally feels a sense of belonging in Smallville.\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **At Event 1**, John is in a high state, successful and thriving in his career and city life.\n- **At Event 2**, John's state significantly worsens as he is forced out of his comfort zone and struggles to adapt to the new environment, feeling alienated and helpless.\n- **At Event 3**, John's state begins to improve as he finds a new purpose and excitement in the treasure hunt, which starts to overshadow his initial discomfort.\n- **At Event 4**, John's state improves dramatically as he achieves success in his quest, overcoming numerous challenges and gaining a new sense of self-reliance and respect for nature.\n- **At Event 5**, John's state reaches a new high, not just in terms of wealth but also in terms of personal growth, acceptance, and a sense of belonging, which he had lacked in his city life.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, it can be observed that John starts in a high state (successful in New York), falls into a dilemma (struggling in Smallville), and then finds a way out through his adventure, ending in an even better state (successful treasure hunt and integration into Smallville). This pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist's condition improves from the first turning point to the last turning point, after an initial downfall. This does not perfectly fit the \"Rags to Riches\" arc since John starts in a high state, nor does it fit \"Riches to Rags\" or \"Icarus\" since John ends in a better state than he began. The closest match is the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma and then recovers to end up better than at the beginning.\n\n### 4.

Craig and Serena's final confrontation inside the wish maker, where Craig convinces Serena to move on, and they jointly wish for the Creek to be saved (sentences 24-26).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: Craig feels displaced after moving to Herkleton. His state is one of discomfort and longing for his old life.\n- **Event 2**: After being intimidated by Serena and losing Small Uncle, Craig's state worsens.

Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout the story. Craig starts in a disadvantaged situation (feeling displaced), faces setbacks (being intimidated by Serena), but then rises as he finds purpose (the quest for the wish maker), faces another setback (being deceived and having to rescue his friends), and ultimately achieves a higher state (finding the wish maker, saving the Creek, and finding belonging). This pattern resembles the **Cinderella** story arc, where the protagonist rises, faces a setback, and ultimately achieves a higher state. Craig's journey from feeling lost and alone to becoming a key figure in saving the Creek and finding friends matches this arc. His condition improves significantly from the start to the end, with moments of decline followed by ultimate success and personal growth.\n\n### 4. Determined Story Arc Type\n\nCinderella"

Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain your reasoning\n\nThe story arc of Tom's journey can be classified by analyzing the progression of his state throughout the major events. Initially, Tom is in a state of discontent and dreaming of change (low point). Upon finding the pocket watch and being transported to Dunmore East, he begins to live out his dreams and takes action against injustices (rise). He faces challenges, including the battle against Maev, but ultimately succeeds in his endeavors (peak). After being returned to his real life, instead of succumbing to his previous state of stagnation, Tom is inspired to make positive changes, indicating a growth and an improvement in his condition (higher state than the beginning).\n\nThis pattern follows the **Cinderella** story arc, where the protagonist rises from a low point, faces setbacks, but ultimately achieves a higher state. Tom's journey from a dissatisfied telemarketer to a brave hero and finally to a personally and professionally fulfilled individual mirrors this arc. He experiences a significant rise in his condition as he navigates through challenges and emerges victorious and changed, applying his experiences to better his real life.\n\n### 4.

Given that Skipper faces a dilemma (the failure of her babysitting service), finds a way out (getting a job and making new friends), faces another challenge (the gaming bus incident), and eventually ends up in a better state (success with the day care center and improved relationships), this pattern suggests a specific story arc type.\n\nThe fact that Skipper experiences two main cycles of facing a problem and then recovering (first with the failure of her babysitting service and then with the challenges at the water park) aligns with a story arc that involves falling into a dilemma and finding a way out, not once but twice, and ending in a better condition than at the start.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Alex Turner, a former CIA operative who is brought back in to help with a critical cyber-attack on America's defense satellites.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. **Event 1**: Alex is persuaded to come out of retirement to help with the cyber-attack ( Sentence 8).\n2. **Event 2**: Alex successfully infiltrates the adversary's systems and uncovers a sinister plot to create global economic instability (Sentences 14-18).\n3. **Event 3**: Alex's loyalty is questioned by his superiors due to his sympathetic portrayal of the enemy, leading to a schism within the CIA (Sentences 20-22).\n4. **Event 4**: The climactic moment of the story where Alex faces off against his former allies in an intense ideological battle (Sentence 25).\n5. **Event 5**: After the mission, Alex returns to his Idaho sanctuary, emotionally scarred and struggling with the memories of his decisions and the reality of espionage (Sentences 28-32).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **At Event 1**: Alex is in a state of peaceful solitude, having chosen a life away from the chaos of his past. His condition is one of tranquility and retirement from the world of espionage.\n- **At Event 2**: Alex's state changes as he becomes deeply involved in the mission, using his skills to infiltrate the adversary's systems. His condition improves in terms of his engagement and purpose, as he is once again using his abilities to make a significant impact.\n- **At Event 3**: Alex's state worsens as his loyalty is questioned, and he faces suspicion and doubt from his former colleagues. This introduces a significant emotional and professional challenge for him.\n- **At Event 4**: Alex's state reaches a climax of tension and conflict as he engages in an ideological battle with his former allies. This event signifies a peak in the challenges he faces, both internally and externally.\n- **At Event 5**: Alex's state deteriorates further as he returns to his solitude, but this time he is emotionally scarred and haunted by the memories of his recent past. His condition at the end is one of sadness, regret, and a stark contrast to his initial peaceful existence.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, the narrative follows a pattern where Alex starts in a relatively peaceful and secluded state (riches), becomes engaged and purposeful (improvement), faces significant challenges and doubts (decline), and ultimately ends in a state of emotional turmoil and regret (rags). This pattern suggests that the story arc type is not one of consistent improvement or simple decline but rather a complex trajectory that involves both rise and fall.\n\nHowever, considering the overall trend from Alex's initial state of peace and solitude to his final state of emotional scarring and struggle, it can be argued that his condition worsens from the beginning to the end of the story. He starts with a form of \"riches\" (peace and solitude) and ends in \"rags\" (emotional pain and regret), which aligns with a specific story arc type.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist in the story is Steve Vail, a retired agent. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Event 1: Introduction to the Mission** - Vail is approached by O’Malley and Kate Bannon to help find Victor Radek (sentences 1-3).\n2. **Event 2: Change of Heart** - Vail's initial refusal to join the mission changes after he is attacked by shooters, making him decide to help Kate (sentences 5-6).\n3. **Event 3: Midpoint Complication** - Vail and Kate's investigation leads them to Sten, where they face a threat, and Vail fights back, indicating a rise in action and danger (sentences 14-16).\n4. **Event 4: Betrayal and Suspicion** - Kate finds burner phones in Vail's bag, leading her to suspect that Vail is working with Radek, creating a rift between them (sentence 47).\n5. **Event 5: Final Confrontation** - Vail confronts Radek, stops him from killing Kostas, and ultimately shoots Radek, resolving the main conflict (sentences 65-71).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1:** Vail is in a state of retirement, having moved on from his past life as an agent. He is not involved in the conflict and is content with his life as a bricklayer.\n- **Event 2:** After the attack, Vail's state changes to one of engagement and danger. He decides to join the mission, which puts him back into his old life of action and risk.\n- **Event 3:** At this point, Vail is fully engaged in the mission, facing threats and taking action. His state is one of heightened risk and activity, with a focus on finding Radek.\n- **Event 4:** The discovery of the burner phones introduces mistrust and complication into Vail's relationships, particularly with Kate. His state becomes one of suspicion and potential isolation, as his actions are questioned.\n- **Event 5:** In the final confrontation, Vail resolves the conflict by stopping Radek. His state changes to one of resolution and possibly redemption, as he apologizes for not protecting Radek's family in the past.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nGiven the protagonist's condition throughout the story, it seems to follow a pattern where Vail faces a dilemma (being pulled back into his old life), finds a way out or through it (engaging with the mission and facing its challenges), and ends in a better state than where he started (having resolved the conflict and found a form of redemption). However, the story also involves a cycle of falling into another dilemma (the suspicion and betrayal) before recovering and achieving a higher state (resolving the conflict and returning to his life with a sense of purpose).\n\nThe story arc that best fits this pattern, considering the cycles of dilemma and recovery, and the ultimate achievement of a higher state, is the **Double Man in a Hole**. This arc type is characterized by the protagonist facing two cycles of falling into a dilemma and then recovering, which aligns with Vail's experiences of being drawn back into his past life, facing complications and mistrust, and ultimately resolving the conflict and finding redemption.\n\n### 4.

nature, was haunted every night by colorful dreams about an aquatic planet, similar to Neptune.\n2) In those dreams, a spectral woman with captivating teal eyes would always appear, seeming to plead desperately for his aid.\n3) Fuelled by those strange dreams and his intense curiosity, John trudged through his daily routine on the construction site.\n4) He felt a constant sense of bewilderment, perplexed by the vivid nature of the recurring dreams that he couldn't shake off.\n5) One day laden with unexpected occurrences, John was handling an earth-boring drill among the clamorous chaos of the construction site, when he discovered an incredible secret hiding just beneath his feet.\n6) As his machine relentlessly burrowed into the depths of the Earth’s crust, it exposed an ancient artifact.\n7) The artifact bore the weight of eons, encased in an impenetrable shroud of dust and hidden under a cloak of intriguing enigma.\n8) John was strangely drawn to the artifact.\n9) Its unusual appearance and the alien glyphs etched onto it in an intricate pattern astonished him, breaking the droning monotony of his mundane life filled mostly with concrete and hard hats.\n10) With a hand trembling from anticipation, he toggled a switch on the strange device, sending a cascade of holographic light into the construction site.\n11) Astonishingly, he had unwittingly unlocked a mesmerizing three-dimensional projection.\n12) The air around the construction site started swirling with radiant hues as the woman from his dreams materialized in front of him.\n13) Her holographic figure maintained that earnest plea from his dreams that had haunted him nightly.\n14) Rocked to the core by the surreal turn of events, John was left confounded.\n15) A dream had intertwined itself with his reality, unearthing a mysterious artifact.\n16) It was then John resolved to undertake a daring journey to the aquatic planet he'd been seeing in his dreams—Neptune.\n17) Rallying his tight-knit group of friends–each with skills in diverse fields and united by a longing for challenging adventures–John unfurled his audacious blueprint towards Neptune.\n18) Pooling their collective construction expertise, John and his teammates erected a makeshift spaceship from salvaged materials.\n19) They worked tirelessly using discarded mechanical components and surplus steel and aluminum to fuel their ambitious endeavor.\n20) Their night-time toiling was not without observers, and they soon attracted the unwanted attention of the unyielding mega-corporation for which they worked.\n21) The corporation, notorious for its ironclad grip on potential profit sources, identified their clandestine project and the ancient artifact as potential avenues of interest or threats to neutralize.\n22) The workers soon found themselves transformed into prey, a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse commenced between them and the relentless corporate forces.\n23) Their hunting grounds: a patchwork of concrete and steel towers scraping the skies.\n24) Backed into a corner, John spearheaded the successful launch of their makeshift spaceship, flickering hope starkly against the incoming menace of the corporation’s tyranny.\n25) Journeying to Neptune was one fraught with trials.\n26) It was a grueling test of nerves, resilience, and technical skills beset on all sides by unforeseen hurdles and disruptions.\n27) Frustrating glitches within their assembled spaceship's system threatened to derail their progress, and random meteor showers pummeled their path, forcing them to face survival trials on an astronomical scale.\n28) In the faceless vastness of space, with the Earth reduced to a simple speck, the unity of John and his team was strained.\n29) Differences fueled by fear and the stress of their situation simmered, igniting sparks of dissent that threatened to dissolve their unity.\n30) Amid the crew's internal strife, John managed to decode the alien script etched into the artifact.\n31) The antiquated artifact metamorphosed into a cosmic key, revealing the ability to interface with and control an advanced technology hidden deep beneath Neptune's icy surface.\n32) The monumental revelation injected a newfound significance into their journey, helping them press on, strengthened by the shared enthusiasm of unknown territories.\n33) Upon setting foot on Neptune’s frosty surface, they were bewildered by the surprisingly inhabitable conditions, courtesy of the advanced alien tech that regulated the environment.\n34) As John and his team traversed the mesmerizing alien landscape, they made a fascinating discovery: the woman from John's dreams, Eris, was not an illusion but a tangible entity—a breathtaking human-alien hybrid who was far less alien than they had anticipated.\n35) Eris, living in self-imposed exile to escape the clutches of power-hungry corporations on Earth, took refuge on Neptune.\n36) She substantiated every dream that John had seen, bringing the phantom to reality.\n37) She explained the lethal potential of alien technology in the hands of unscrupulous humans, painting a grim picture of a dystopian future.\n38) Eris also had dangerous news for John and his team—a corporate fleet, hell-bent on exploiting her and her secrets, was hot on their trail, determined to claim Neptune as its own.\n39) United against the common enemy, John and Eris, along with his friends, cadged together a concrete plan to outwit the incoming pillagers.\n40) Marshaling the overwhelming potential of alien technology, they also relied heavily on their shared resolve, and strategic manoeuvres, as they steeled themselves for the impending battle.\n41) As predicted, the corporate fleet launched their offensive in a merciless display of power.\n42) Their meticulously outlined strategies, however, began to crumble under the sustained and resilient opposition from Eris, John, and his friends.\n43) Utilizing the alien technology expertly, John and his team gained the upper hand in their struggle against the corporate mercenaries.\n44) Facing the threat of a crushing defeat, the corporate troops were left with no choice but to retreat.\n45) The victory marked a decisive moment in favor of John and his rag-tag team of cosmic rebels.\n46) They now custodians of alien technology sufficiently advanced to appear as magic, John and his friends made a pact—they’d keep this tech a secret from humanity’s unrelenting grasp, relinquishing any possibility of turning a profit.\n47) Life irrevocably transformed, John Smith—who was once a mere construction worker—now stood as a guardian of the cosmic order, dwelling on a planet where no human had set foot before.\n48) John chose to remain on Neptune with Eris, leaving his past life behind.\n49) He carved out a new life for himself, embracing his responsibilities as a sentinel of the unknown and a consistent influence maintaining the delicate balance in the cosmos.\n50) Over time, his bond with Eris grew stronger while his ties with his old life back on Earth grew fainter, turning him slowly into a stalwart guard of a universal secret.\n51) Their shared experiences and the adversity they overcome had forged a bond of friendship within the team, which would forever relate them to one another.\n52) Their journey had turned them from simple construction workers into celestial protectors.\n53) They took on their new role with a sense of reverence.\n54) They were now the guardians of cosmic secrets, the pioneers of a new era, a beacon for any misdirected or lost kickstart in the universe.\n55) Their journey from Earth to Neptune, from turmoil, conflict, and near-annihilation to triumphant survival, stood as a testament to the indomitable spirit and resilience of humankind—even in the face of alien worlds and formidable, unknown technology.\n56) Back on Earth, the conglomerate that had pursued them with dogged determination continued to loom in the background, representing a constant reminder of the insatiable human hunger for power and control that was unchecked back home.\n57) Neptune, flourishing under its new guardians and the secrets they guarded, didn’t seem to care much about the crises unravelling on Earth.\n58) Tales of John's extraordinary voyage reverberated within the confines of construction sites on Earth.\n59) His daring adventure sparked a sense of boundless possibilities in the hearts of many.\n60) John and Eris, in their outpost on the farthest edge of the known universe, continued their cosmic watch.\n61) Their bond deepened with each passing moment, bringing them closer in their mission to guard the expansive cosmos.\n62) John had shown remarkable grit and determination in his journey, embracing his role as the new \"Cosmic Guardian\" readily.\n63) The man who once was limited to the tough, mundane life of manual labor had found a higher purpose.\n64) He was now tasked with the exclusive duty of protecting unseen parts of the universe from known threats.\n65) The journey that John embarked on, one that he thought was a one-off, had left a formidable imprint on human history, marking the first successful human voyage to Neptune.\n66) The tale of John's ordinary beginnings—as a diligent construction worker—the friendships he crafted during his odyssey, and the victorious result redefined the essence of true heroism.\n67) It was the story of an unassuming man who, driven by his dreams, risked all odds to protect an alien secret and left a powerful message for those inspired to dream beyond the sphere of human existence.\n68) A legend in his own right, John Smith had lived the extraordinary tale, transitioning from the life of an ordinary construction worker to the guardian of a divine cosmic secret.\n69) His story was an exemplary tale of an unlikely hero, etched firmly in the annals of history and in the hearts of those who dared to dream.\n\nStory Arc

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is John Smith, a dedicated construction worker. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Discovery of the Ancient Artifact**: John discovers an ancient artifact while working on the construction site (sentence 6).\n2. **Unlocking the Artifact's Secret**: John unlocks the artifact, revealing a holographic projection of the woman from his dreams (sentence 10).\n3. **Decision to Journey to Neptune**: John decides to embark on a journey to Neptune, driven by his dreams and the secrets of the artifact (sentence 16).\n4. **Battle Against the Corporate Fleet**: John and his team face off against a corporate fleet that seeks to exploit the alien technology on Neptune (sentence 41).\n5. **Victory and New Role**: John and his team emerge victorious, and John takes on a new role as a guardian of the cosmic order, staying on Neptune with Eris (sentence 47).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (Discovery of the Artifact)**: John's state changes from a mundane routine to one of astonishment and curiosity. His discovery sets him on a path of intrigue and adventure, improving his state from mere routine to one of purpose.\n- **Event 2 (Unlocking the Artifact's Secret)**: John's state shifts from curiosity to being confounded and intrigued by the surreal turn of events. This marks a significant point where his reality and dreams start to intertwine, further engaging him in the mystery and slightly elevating his state of mind due to the excitement and fear of the unknown.\n- **Event 3 (Decision to Journey to Neptune)**: John resolves to undertake a daring journey, indicating a transition from a state of confusion and curiosity to one of determination and adventure. This decision significantly improves his state, as he moves from a passive recipient of dreams to an active seeker of truth and adventure.\n- **Event 4 (Battle Against the Corporate Fleet)**: John faces a drastic challenge, shifting his state from one of adventure and discovery to danger and adversity. This event marks a low point in John's journey, where his state worsens due to the threat of defeat and the danger posed by the corporate fleet.\n- **Event 5 (Victory and New Role)**: After emerging victorious, John's state improves dramatically. He transitions from being a construction worker to becoming a guardian of the cosmic order, marking a significant improvement in his condition. He finds a new purpose, a new home, and a new sense of fulfillment, elevating his state to a much higher level than at the beginning of the story.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc can be classified based on how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the narrative. Initially, John is in a mundane situation (construction worker), then he faces a series of challenges and mysteries (discovery of the artifact, unlocking its secrets, journey to Neptune), followed by a significant adversity (battle against the corporate fleet), and finally, he emerges into a much improved state (victory and becoming a guardian of the cosmic order).\n\nGiven these transitions, John's story follows a pattern where he faces challenges, falls into dilemmas (e.g., the battle against the corporate fleet), but ultimately finds a way out and ends in a better state than where he began. This pattern is characteristic of the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist faces a problem, struggles, and then overcomes it to achieve a better condition. However, the story also involves a second cycle of dilemma and recovery (facing the corporate fleet and then defeating them), which could suggest elements of a \"Double Man in a Hole\" story arc. Yet, the primary narrative thread focuses on John's overall journey from a mundane life to one of cosmic significance, which aligns more closely with the \"Man in a Hole\" arc due to the singular, overarching narrative of downfall and recovery.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To classify the story arc type, let's first identify the protagonist and major events in the story.\n\nThe story doesn't have a single protagonist but rather a group of protagonists, the five distinct teenagers: Jake, Matt, Grace, Violet, and Emily. For the purpose of analysis, we'll consider the group as a collective protagonist.\n\nHere are 5 major events in the story:\n\n1. **Introduction to the characters and their individual struggles** (sentences 3-8): The group is introduced, showcasing their unique characteristics and challenges.\n2. **Receiving the cryptic notes and being brought together in detention** (sentences 9-11): The group is forced to interact, leading to initial hostility and animosity.\n3. **Sharing personal stories and forming a bond** (sentences 12-17): As they spend time together, they open up about their personal battles, leading to a deeper understanding and connection among them.\n4. **Planning and executing the escape from detention** (sentences 18-20): The group works together to outsmart their principal and escape the detention classroom.\n5. **Solidifying their friendship and newfound confidence** (sentences 23-28): After their adventure, they form a stronger bond, promising respect and support to each other, and confidently challenge the norms and expectations at their school.\n\nNow, let's describe the protagonist's state and how it changed relative to the previous events:\n\n* At event 1, the group is introduced, and each member is struggling with their own issues, feeling isolated or pressured in their own way. Their state is one of individual struggle and disconnection.\n* At event 2, the group is brought together, but their initial interactions are tense and hostile. Their state has become one of collective discomfort and conflict.\n* At event 3, as they share their personal stories, they begin to form a connection and understand each other's struggles. Their state shifts to one of empathy and budding friendship.\n* At event 4, the group works together to achieve a common goal (escaping detention), showcasing their growing trust and cooperation. Their state has improved, as they're now working together and relying on each other.\n* At event 5, the group has solidified their friendship and is now confident in challenging the norms and expectations at their school. Their state has improved significantly, as they've formed a strong bond and are now empowered to make changes.\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, we can see that the group starts in a state of individual struggle and disconnection, falls into a state of collective conflict, but then recovers and improves as they form a connection and work together. Ultimately, they achieve a higher state of confidence, empathy, and friendship.\n\nThe story arc type is **Man in a Hole**, as the protagonist (the group) falls into a dilemma (detention and initial conflict) but finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning (forming a strong bond and gaining confidence).\n\nMan in a Hole"

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Jack Thompson, a former marine whose life is turned upside down when his newborn son, Ethan, is kidnapped. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. **The kidnapping of Ethan** (sentence 5): This event sets the story in motion and changes Jack's life forever.\n2. **Jack discovering the truth about Project Orion** (sentence 7): This marks a turning point where Jack begins to understand the scale and nature of the threat his son and other children face.\n3. **Jack assembling a team to help him** (sentences 10-12): This event signifies Jack's transition from a lone, grieving father to a determined leader on a mission.\n4. **The final infiltration of the Spark Eye facility** (sentences 15-21): This is the climax of the story where Jack and his team face their greatest challenges and achieve their primary goal of rescuing the children.\n5. **The aftermath and the establishment of a sanctuary for the rescued children** (sentences 27-34): This final event shows the resolution of the story and the positive change that Jack's actions have brought about.\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **At the first event (Ethan's kidnapping)**: Jack's state changes from peaceful to desperate and grieving. He loses his son, which upends his life.\n- **At the second event (discovering Project Orion)**: Jack's state evolves from mere desperation to determination. He gains a direction and a purpose, which is to rescue his son and uncover the truth.\n- **At the third event (assembling a team)**: Jack's state improves further as he transitions from a lone individual to a leader of a group. This gives him more hope and resources to tackle his mission.\n- **At the fourth event (the final infiltration)**: Jack faces significant danger but ultimately succeeds in rescuing his son and the other children. His state at this point is one of relief and triumph.\n- **At the fifth event (the aftermath)**: Jack's state is one of reflection and new beginnings. He has not only rescued his son but has also found a way to help other victims and create a positive legacy from his ordeal.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, we can observe that Jack starts in a relatively good state (living a quiet life), falls into a deep hole (his son's kidnapping and the subsequent discovery of the sinister plot), and then finds a way out through his actions and determinations, ultimately ending in a better state than where he began (having rescued his son, stopped the evil corporation, and found a new purpose in life).\n\nThis pattern fits the **Man in a Hole** story arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma but finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning. The key characteristics of this arc are present: an initial fall into a problem (the kidnapping), a struggle to address the problem (discovering the truth and assembling a team), and a successful resolution that leads to a better outcome (rescuing the children and creating a sanctuary).\n\n### 4.

but the body of a dead soldier cushions his fall, and he is simply knocked unconscious.\n11) Mekum orders their bodies dumped like garbage, and the remaining \"old\" soldiers are demoted to menial support roles.\n12) Meanwhile Caine gets an artificial blue eye to replace the brown eye he lost.\n13) Todd and his dead comrades are dumped on the surface of Arcadia 234, a waste disposal planet with dangerously high winds.\n14) Though badly injured, Todd limps toward a colony of humans who crash-landed there twelve years earlier, and have managed to survive and build a society from the planet's mountains of trash.\n15) Though they try to make him welcome, Todd has difficulty adapting to the community due to his extreme conditioning and their extreme pacifism.\n16) Todd's training, and subsequently stunted social skills, make it difficult for him to answer in anything more than curt replies.\n17) Many of the settlers are afraid of him, but he is accepted and sheltered by Mace (Sean Pertwee) and his wife Sandra (Connie Nielsen).\n18) Todd develops a silent rapport with their mute son, Nathan (Jared and Taylor Throne), who had been traumatized by a snakebite earlier in his life.\n19) In a later conflict with a coiled snake, Todd teaches Nathan how to face it down and strike back to protect himself.\n20) His parents misinterpret the lesson, unsure of how to deal with Todd.\n21) However, Todd soon begins to experience flashbacks from his time as a soldier and mistakes one of the pacifist colonists (Michael Chiklis) for an enemy, nearly killing him.\n22) The pacifists decide that Todd is too dangerous to live among them, so they give him supplies and democratically vote him out of the colony.\n23) Outside the colony, he sheds tears, but appears confused, implying that this is the first time in his life that he has ever cried.\n24) A short time later, Mace and Sandra are almost bitten by another snake while sleeping, but are saved by Nathan, who used Todd's technique.\n25) Mace then realizes that Todd taught their son how to protect his parents from the snakes.\n26) He also realizes that Todd has an important role to play in their community, and decides to search for the soldier on his own and bring him back.\n27) The colonists object, saying that they had voted him out democratically, but Mace insists that \"We voted wrong.\"\n28) The new genetically engineered soldiers arrive on the garbage planet for a training exercise.\n29) Since the world is listed as uninhabited, Colonel Mekum decides that the pacifists' presence is unlawful and, for practice, orders his troops to slaughter them.\n30) Frightened children hide underground and hope not to be seen.\n31) Mace is spotted by the troops and killed just after he finds Todd.\n32) Though outmanned and outgunned, Todd's years of battle experience and superior knowledge of the planet allow him to return to the colony and kill the advance squad attacking the pacifists.\n33) Nervous that an unknown enemy force may be confronting them, Colonel Mekum orders the soldiers to withdraw and return with heavy artillery.\n34) Using guerilla tactics, Todd outmaneuvers and defeats all of the remaining soldiers, including Caine 607, who is defeated in hand-to-hand combat.\n35) Panicking, Mekum orders the transport ship's crew, composed of Todd's old squad, to set up and activate a portable nuclear device powerful enough to destroy the planet, then orders the ship to lift off, leaving the squad behind.\n36) When Captain Church objects, Mekum shoots him in cold blood.\n37) Before they can take off as planned, Todd appears, and his old comrades recognize him as the ranking officer due to their conditioning and silently side with him over the army that has discarded them.\n38) Todd and his comrades take over the ship, leaving Mekum and his aides on the planet, then evacuate the remaining colonists just before the bomb detonates.\n39) Mekum wets his pants as he realizes he is helpless.\n40) Todd orders the ship to set course for the Trinity Moons, the colonists' original destination, then picks up Nathan and points to their new destination, while looking out upon the galaxy.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better (e.g., 0→1→2→4→10)\n- Riches to Rags: Protagonist starts high and ends lower (e.g., 10→9→8→6→0)\n- Man in a Hole: Protagonist falls into trouble but recovers (e.g., 6→2→1→4→10)\n- Icarus: Protagonist rises then falls dramatically (e.g., 2→4→9→5→1)\n- Double Man in a Hole: Two cycles of fall and recovery (e.g., 6→2→7→4→10)\n- Cinderella: Rise, setback, ultimate triumph (e.g., 1→7→4→1→10)\n- Oedipus: Start high, fall, recover, final fall (e.g., 10→4→7→9→1)",

Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Introduction to Project Adam and Todd's Background (Sentences 1-5)**: This event sets the stage for Todd's character, showcasing his upbringing and training as a soldier.\n2. **The Introduction of Genetically Engineered Soldiers and Todd's Defeat (Sentences 6-9)**: This marks a significant turning point where Todd faces a new, superior opponent and is defeated.\n3. **Todd's Survival on Arcadia 234 and Initial Integration with the Colonists (Sentences 13-18)**: After being left for dead, Todd finds himself on a waste disposal planet and begins to interact with a community of pacifists.\n4. **Todd's Flashbacks, Aggression, and Subsequent Exile from the Colony (Sentences 20-23)**: Todd starts experiencing flashbacks and nearly kills one of the colonists, leading to his exile from the colony.\n5. **The Final Confrontation with the Genetically Engineered Soldiers and Redemption (Sentences 28-40)**: This event involves Todd protecting the colonists from the new soldiers, leading to his redemption and a new purpose.\n\n### 2. Description of Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Todd is introduced as a hardened, disciplined soldier with no understanding of life outside military routine. His state is one of peak physical and mental conditioning but emotional numbness.\n- **Event 2**: After being defeated by Caine 607, Todd's state changes to one of vulnerability and obsolescence. He is no longer the superior soldier he once was.\n- **Event 3**: On Arcadia 234, Todd begins to show signs of humanity and attempts to integrate with the colonists. His state improves as he starts to form connections, albeit struggle with his past conditioning.\n- **Event 4**: With the onset of flashbacks and aggressive behavior, Todd's state deteriorates. He becomes a danger to the colony and is exiled, hitting a low point in his social and emotional journey.\n- **Event 5**: In the final confrontation, Todd finds redemption by protecting the colonists and defeating his enemies. His state improves significantly as he finds a new purpose and begins to embrace his humanity.\n\n### 3. Classification of Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc of Sgt. Todd 3465 can be classified based on the pattern of his condition throughout the story. Initially, Todd is at a peak in terms of his military prowess but lacks emotional depth. He then faces a downfall with his defeat and subsequent exile. However, he experiences a series of events that lead to his recovery and eventual redemption. This pattern of falling into a dilemma (defeat and exile) and then finding a way out (redemption and new purpose) is characteristic of a specific story arc type.\n\nGiven the description of the story arcs provided, Todd's journey fits the **Double Man in a Hole** story arc type because he faces two significant cycles of dilemma and recovery. First, he faces a physical and professional dilemma with his defeat and obsolescence, and then an emotional and social dilemma with his exile from the colony. Both times, he manages to recover and improve his condition, culminating in his final act of redemption and newfound purpose.\n\n### 4. Determined Story Arc Type\n\nDouble Man in a Hole"

the experiences of his life, gleaned from various unnoticed sources, simply prepared him to answer the contest's questions correctly.\n21) Gathering their meticulously collated evidence, Aadi and Nilam make their case public and challenge the earlier accusation in a high-tension legal debate.\n22) Astonished, the audiences watch as their extensive evidence successfully unveils the host's concealed intentions.\n23) Recognizing Aadi's earnestness, the general public starts fervently rallying for him, demanding justice for the slandered boy.\n24) Silenced watchers transform into vehement protestors, their dissent against the injustice growing louder and unyielding.\n25) Consequently, Aadi is warmly reinstated to the trivia show amidst pulsating applause, assuring him a second chance to fair victory.\n26) A renewed and confident Aadi courageously answers the final question correctly, scripting an unprecedented victory in the history of the quiz.\n27) His victory spawns uncontained joy among friends, neighbors, and even strangers, bringing everyone into unison to celebrate his success.\n28) Epilogue sees the establishment of a learning center, financed from the prize money Aadi won at the trivia show.\n29) The newly erected learning center, rooted in Aadi’s aspirations, stands firm amidst Kolkata’s desolate poverty, radiating hope.\n30) The narrative concludes with a shot of Aadi’s serene countenance, triumphantly signifying the transformative power of knowledge and the indomitable spirit of human tenacity.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better (e.g., 0→1→2→4→10)\n- Riches to Rags: Protagonist starts high and ends lower (e.g., 10→9→8→6→0)\n- Man in a Hole: Protagonist falls into trouble but recovers (e.g., 6→2→1→4→10)\n- Icarus: Protagonist rises then falls dramatically (e.g., 2→4→9→5→1)\n- Double Man in a Hole: Two cycles of fall and recovery (e.g., 6→2→7→4→10)\n- Cinderella: Rise, setback, ultimate triumph (e.g., 1→7→4→1→10)\n- Oedipus: Start high, fall, recover, final fall (e.g., 10→4→7→9→1)",

Aadi's journey from poverty and obscurity to temporary success, then to a false accusation and public shame, and finally to vindication and victory mirrors the Cinderella arc.

        "output": "### 1. Identification of Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Bea, a female soldier renowned for her wits and strategic thinking. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. Bea stands tall amidst the discouragement and devastation after the British onslaught, planning to ensnare Captain James \"Jim\" Bristow (sentence 4).\n2. Bea reveals her ruse and ensnares Jim with the help of her rebel comrades (sentence 12).\n3. Jim sees through Bea's hardened exterior, and they engage in deep conversations about life, war, and loss, unveiling Bea's past (sentence 15).\n4. Bea decides to free Jim, sabotaging the lone watchtower to assist his escape (sentence 25).\n5. Bea is branded a traitor and deserted by her rebel comrades after Jim's escape (sentence 27).\n\n### 2. Description of Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Bea's state is one of determination and strength. She is planning to ensnare a British officer, which shows her proactive and courageous stance amidst a grim backdrop.\n- **Event 2**: Bea's state changes to one of control and dominance as she successfully captures Jim. This event shows an increase in her power and influence in the story.\n- **Event 3**: Bea's state shifts to a more vulnerable one as Jim sees through her exterior and she opens up about her past. This marks a turning point where her emotional wall is breached, and she begins to develop feelings for Jim.\n- **Event 4**: Bea's state is one of empathy and risk-taking as she decides to free Jim. This decision puts her in a precarious position, showing a significant change from her initial goal of capturing him.\n- **Event 5**: Bea's state is one of isolation and danger as she is branded a traitor. This event shows a significant downfall in her social standing and security within her group.\n\n### 3. Classification of Story Arc Type\n\nAnalyzing Bea's state throughout these events, we can observe a pattern. Initially, Bea is in a position of strength and determination. As the story progresses, she faces a moral dilemma and begins to question her initial intentions, leading to a vulnerable state. Her decision to free Jim leads to a significant downfall in her social standing, marking a low point. However, this story does not simply end with her downfall; the impact of her actions continues, affecting Jim's perception of the war and his enemies. \n\nGiven these observations, the story arc can be classified based on the protagonist's condition throughout. The protagonist starts in a relatively strong position, faces challenges that lead to a vulnerable state, makes a risky decision that results in a significant downfall, but ultimately, her actions have a profound and positive impact on another character, suggesting a form of redemption or positive outcome from her sacrifices.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To analyze the story arc of the given narrative, let's follow the instructions step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the protagonist and 5 major events in the story:**\n   - The protagonist of the story is Emma Lee, a pop sensation.\n   - Five major events in the story are:\n     1. Emma confesses her deep-seated loneliness to her closest friends despite her successful career (sentence 3).\n     2. Emma decides to start her journey towards motherhood through in vitro fertilization (sentence 6).\n     3. Emma announces her pregnancy and then learns she is having twins, which adds a new layer of complexity to her life (sentences 9 and 10).\n     4. Emma experiences an emotional breakdown on camera due to the strains of her celebrity life, pregnancy, and the scrutiny of reality TV cameras (sentence 18).\n     5. Emma gives birth to her twins and navigates her new life as a single mother, ultimately finding happiness and resilience (sentences 23-28).\n\n2. **Describe the protagonist's state and how it changed relative to the previous events:**\n   - **Event 1 (sentence 3):** Emma is in a state of deep-seated loneliness despite her outward success. Her condition is low due to her emotional state.\n   - **Event 2 (sentence 6):** Emma decides to pursue motherhood, which indicates a desire for change and an attempt to fill the void in her life. Her condition starts to improve as she takes proactive steps towards a personal goal.\n   - **Event 3 (sentences 9 and 10):** Learning she is pregnant with twins adds both excitement and stress to her life. While this is a positive development, it also introduces new challenges. Her condition can be seen as improving due to the positive aspect of becoming a mother, but it's also complicated by the added stress.\n   - **Event 4 (sentence 18):** Emma's emotional breakdown indicates a low point in her journey. The pressures of her life have overwhelmed her, and her condition has worsened compared to the previous events.\n   - **Event 5 (sentences 23-28):** After giving birth and navigating the challenges of being a new mother, Emma finds happiness and resilience. Her condition has improved significantly as she has found a new sense of purpose and fulfillment.\n\n3. **Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain your reasoning:**\n   - The story arc type can be classified based on how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the narrative. Given that Emma starts in a state of loneliness (a low point), decides to pursue motherhood (an attempt to improve her condition), faces challenges and setbacks (including an emotional breakdown, a lower point), and ultimately finds happiness and fulfillment as a mother (a high point), we can see a pattern where she falls into a dilemma (her loneliness and the challenges of pregnancy and motherhood) and then finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning.\n   - This pattern aligns with the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist faces a dilemma, hits a low point, and then recovers to a better state than where they started. Emma's journey from loneliness to finding purpose and happiness as a single mother, despite the challenges she faces, exemplifies this arc.\n\n4. **Determined story arc type:**\nMan in a Hole"

She not only achieves her goal of bringing the perpetrators to justice but also undergoes a significant personal transformation, emerging as an icon of feminine strength and a proponent of fairness and righteousness.\n\nGiven this progression, the story arc type can be classified as a **Man in a Hole** because Adrienne falls into a dilemma (the attack on her friend and her subsequent feelings of helplessness) and then finds a way out, ending in a better state than where she began (transformed and empowered).\n\n### 4.

His state is one of confidence and capability.\n- **Event 2:** Carl's decision to go undercover marks a shift from a straightforward police operation to a more complex and personal mission, indicating a rise in his determination to protect Melanie and solve the case. His state becomes more personally invested.\n- **Event 3:** Discovering Melanie's involvement with the crime syndicate adds a layer of personal urgency and risk to Carl's mission, putting him in a more precarious and emotionally challenging situation. His state worsens due to increased personal stakes.\n- **Event 4:** Planning and executing the covert operation to save Melanie shows Carl at a peak of determination and tactical prowess, indicating a significant improvement in his state as he takes bold action to protect those he cares about.\n- **Event 5:** After saving Melanie and committing to rebuild their relationship, Carl's state improves to a higher point than at the beginning, as he not only succeeds in his mission but also achieves a personal victory by potentially rekindling his relationship with Melanie.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\nGiven the progression of Carl's state throughout the story:\n- He starts in a position of strength and confidence.\n- Faces personal and professional challenges that complicate his life and put him in risky situations.\n- Experiences a worsening of his state due to increased personal stakes.\n- Then, through his actions, improves his situation significantly, both in terms of his mission and his personal life.\n- Ends in a better state than where he began, having succeeded in his goals and potentially revitalized his relationship.\n\nThis pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist faces challenges, falls into a difficult situation, but ultimately rises to achieve a better state than at the start. This description aligns with the **Cinderella** story arc type, where the protagonist rises, faces a setback, and ultimately achieves a higher state.\n\n### 4. Determined Story Arc Type\nCinderella"

        "output": "To classify the story arc type, let's first identify the protagonist and 5 major events in the story.\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Emily Adams, as the narrative revolves around her actions and decisions.\n\nHere are 5 major events in the story:\n\n1. **Event 1: Introduction to the protagonist's world** ( sentences 1-5) - The story introduces Emily Adams, her father John, and their firm Ardon Capital, which is close to landing a significant client.\n2. **Event 2: The crisis unfolds** (sentences 6-11) - Whispers of corporate conspiracy and the rival firm Vortex Partners' involvement threaten Ardon Capital's deal.\n3. **Event 3: Emily launches her investigation** (sentences 10-14) - Emily starts her own investigation to reveal the truth behind the conspiracy, and her father faces mounting pressure from investors.\n4. **Event 4: Confrontation and revelation** (sentences 15-20) - Emily and John confront Robert, the CEO of Vortex Partners, and gather evidence of his deceit.\n5. **Event 5: Resolution and triumph** (sentences 21-41) - The truth about Robert's conspiracy is exposed, and Ardon Capital emerges victorious, with Emily and John receiving congratulations and praise.\n\nNow, let's analyze the protagonist's state at each event and how it changed relative to the previous events:\n\n- At **Event 1**, Emily is introduced in her father's shadow, with her firm on the verge of a significant success. Her state is one of potential and anticipation.\n- By **Event 2**, Emily's world is disrupted by the crisis, and her state becomes one of concern and suspicion. Her condition has worsened as she faces the challenge of saving her family's business.\n- At **Event 3**, Emily takes action by launching her investigation. Her state transitions from passive concern to active engagement, showing determination and initiative. Her condition starts to improve as she takes control of the situation.\n- During **Event 4**, Emily's investigation leads to a confrontation, and she successfully gathers evidence. Her state improves further as she achieves a significant victory, moving closer to resolving the crisis.\n- By **Event 5**, Emily's actions lead to the exposure of the conspiracy, and she emerges victorious alongside her father. Her state has improved significantly from the initial crisis, ending in a position of triumph and recognition.\n\nBased on this analysis, the story arc type can be classified by observing the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. Emily starts in a state of potential, faces a significant challenge (falling into a dilemma), and then finds a way out through her actions, ending in a better state than where she began. This pattern aligns with a specific story arc type.\n\nThe determined story arc type is Man in a Hole."

he spent countless nights gazing at the cosmic bodies, his anxiety surmounting.\n18) His mental condition balanced on the knife-edge of an abyss.\n19) His loneliness began to transform into a fear of himself, his deteriorating mental state, and his unending hallucinations.\n20) Despite his declining sanity, he plunged in, enticed by the mysteries held within the cluster of sparkling stars.\n21) In a daring move, John disregarded Astro Corp's regulations, sharing his unbelievable findings with Earth.\n22) His communication immediately set off alarms, and Astro Corp hastily arranged for a replacement astronaut to take over the lunar station.\n23) Unfazed by these developments, John undertook a final expedition into the heart of the Elysium Stars.\n24) With an unyielding spirit, he boarded his lunar shuttle, \"Stellar Explorer\", heading towards the unknown buried within the unfathomable cosmic bodies.\n25) However, in the following weeks, the once habituated hum of the Astro Corp outpost fell into a devastating silence.\n26) John's regular communications ceased abruptly, and his whereabouts plunged into unsolvable mystery.\n27) Alarming signals indicating John's puzzling disappearance were released into the cosmos, setting the stage for the arrival of his replacement astronaut.\n28) The mission had suddenly assumed a dire tone, the unknown that lay before the incoming astronaut growing in intensity.\n29) As the search for John escalated, his raw, emotional video logs played, their contents echoing through the empty outpost.\n30) His absence, amplified by the mysteriously vacant quarters he once inhabited, only multiplied the mounting questions about his sudden departure.\n31) After grueling days of lunar search expeditions, the incoming astronaut finally stumbled upon John, lying unconscious near the hypnotizing sphere of Elysium Stars.\n32) Despite the dire circumstances, John was quickly relocated to the outpost and transported back to Earth.\n33) His unconscious state, coupled with periods of fevered mutterings about the Elysium Stars, raised more questions than answers.\n34) Back on Earth, a team of experts studied John, puzzled by his psychologically adrift state.\n35) Despite his physical presence, his mind seemed to still wander among the celestial bodies he left behind.\n36) His constant murmurs about the Elysium Stars set off a worldwide wave of fascination for this mesmerizing constellation.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better (e.g., 0→1→2→4→10)\n- Riches to Rags: Protagonist starts high and ends lower (e.g., 10→9→8→6→0)\n- Man in a Hole: Protagonist falls into trouble but recovers (e.g., 6→2→1→4→10)\n- Icarus: Protagonist rises then falls dramatically (e.g., 2→4→9→5→1)\n- Double Man in a Hole: Two cycles of fall and recovery (e.g., 6→2→7→4→10)\n- Cinderella: Rise, setback, ultimate triumph (e.g., 1→7→4→1→10)\n- Oedipus: Start high, fall, recover, final fall (e.g., 10→4→7→9→1)",
        "output": "### TASK 1: Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is John, the isolated astronaut living on the moon's dark side at the Astro Corp outpost.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. **Discovery of the Anomaly and Elysium Stars**: John discovers an unusual energy signature and the Elysium Stars, which sparks his curiosity and sets him on a path of discovery (sentences 8-12).\n2. **Internal Conflict and Choice**: John is torn between his duties and his desire to explore the Elysium Stars, ultimately choosing to delve deeper into the mystery (sentences 13-14).\n3. **Deterioration of Mental State**: As John becomes more obsessed with the Elysium Stars, his mental state begins to deteriorate, marked by vivid dreams, loss of sleep, and increasing anxiety (sentences 15-19).\n4. **Defiance and Expedition**: Despite his declining sanity, John decides to share his findings with Earth and then undertakes a final, daring expedition into the heart of the Elysium Stars, disregarding Astro Corp's regulations (sentences 21-24).\n5. **Rescue and Aftermath**: John is found unconscious near the Elysium Stars, rescued, and returned to Earth, where his psychological state is found to be adrift, still haunted by the celestial bodies he discovered (sentences 31-35).\n\n### TASK 2: Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **Discovery of the Anomaly and Elysium Stars**: John's state changes from monotony and loneliness to curiosity and intrigue. This event marks a turning point where John's condition improves slightly as he finds a new purpose.\n2. **Internal Conflict and Choice**: John's state is one of conflict, but he makes a choice that aligns with his heart's desire, showing a moment of resolve and determination. His condition remains complex, with both positive (engagement with a new discovery) and negative (internal conflict) aspects.\n3. **Deterioration of Mental State**: John's state worsens significantly as his obsession with the Elysium Stars leads to a decline in his mental health, characterized by anxiety, hallucinations, and fear. This marks a low point in his condition.\n4. **Defiance and Expedition**: Despite his poor mental state, John shows courage and determination by deciding to pursue his discovery, regardless of the consequences. This act can be seen as a moment of defiance against his deteriorating condition, but it also leads to a more dangerous and risky situation.\n5. **Rescue and Aftermath**: John's state is one of physical rescue but psychological distress. He is safe but still mentally adrift, indicating that while he has been pulled out of the immediate danger, his overall condition has not significantly improved from its lowest point.\n\n### TASK 3: Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the story. Initially, John is in a state of loneliness and monotony, which can be considered a low point. The discovery of the Elysium Stars improves his condition slightly as it gives him a sense of purpose. However, as the story progresses, his condition worsens due to his obsession, leading to a significant decline in his mental health. This decline is followed by a moment of risk and defiance, and ultimately, he is rescued but left in a psychologically fragile state.\n\nGiven these changes, the story does not follow a simple improvement or decline. Instead, John faces a dilemma (his loneliness and the discovery that leads to obsession), falls into a deeper problem (his deteriorating mental state), and then finds a way out of the immediate danger (being rescued) but not out of his psychological distress. This pattern suggests a story arc where the protagonist faces challenges, hits a low point, and then experiences a form of rescue or resolution, but not necessarily a complete recovery to a better state than where he started.\n\n### TASK 4: Determined Story Arc Type\n\nMan in a Hole"

This is an upward shift in his condition.\n- **Event 2 (Exacting revenge):** Stanley's state continues to improve as he gains confidence and exacts revenge, showing a further upward shift.\n- **Event 3 (Suspected by police and meeting Tina):** While being suspected by the police introduces complications, Stanley's personal life improves with his relationship with Tina, indicating an overall upward trend in his condition, albeit with challenges.\n- **Event 4 (Tyrell becomes The Mask and kidnaps Tina):** This marks a significant downward shift in Stanley's condition as he faces danger and loss.\n- **Event 5 (Defeating Tyrell and being hailed as a hero):** Stanley's condition improves dramatically as he achieves victory, saves Tina, and is recognized as a hero, marking a peak in his story arc.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the analysis, Stanley's story follows a pattern where he starts in a disadvantaged position, rises to a position of power and confidence (with the mask), faces a setback when the mask is taken and used by Tyrell, and then ultimately achieves a higher state by defeating the villain and being hailed as a hero. This pattern matches the **Cinderella** story arc type, which involves a rise, a setback, and ultimately achieving a higher state.\n\n### 4. Determined Story Arc Type\n\nCinderella"

        "output": "To classify the story arc type, let's first identify the protagonist and major events in the story.\n\nThe protagonist in this story is not a single individual but rather a group of eight contrasting individuals who come together to form a team. They are the intellectual librarian, the burly mechanic, the humble street cleaner, the charismatic bartender, the primary school teacher, the bank employee, the formidable security guard, and the seasoned gardener.\n\nHere are 5 major events in the story:\n\n1. **Introduction to the characters' daily lives** (sentences 1-6): We see the characters going about their daily routines, seemingly ordinary and unconnected.\n2. **The plan to steal \"The Dawn's Tear\"** (sentences 7-14): The characters' mundane outward appearances peel back to reveal concealed identities as they prepare for an audacious plan to steal the diamond.\n3. **The heist and its aftermath** (sentences 15-25): The group executes their plan, but it turns reckless, and a deadly scuffle ensues, triggering the museum's security system.\n4. **Forming an alliance and evading the SWAT team** (sentences 26-32): Despite initial mistrust, the group forms an unlikely alliance, pooling their diverse skills to evade the rapidly closing in SWAT team.\n5. **The resolution and return to normal life** (sentences 33-55): The group decides to use the diamond as bait to trap the mob boss, Samuel \"The Snake\" Sullivan, and ultimately succeeds in bringing him to justice, after which they return to their regular lives.\n\nNow, let's describe the protagonist's state at each event and how it changed relative to the previous events:\n\n- At event 1, the protagonist (the group) is in a state of **separation and ordinariness**, living their individual lives without any hint of the adventure to come.\n- By event 2, the protagonist's state changes to one of **excitement and anticipation** as they prepare for the heist, revealing their hidden skills and personalities.\n- At event 3, the protagonist's state shifts to **chaos and danger** as the heist goes awry, and they must fight to survive.\n- During event 4, the protagonist's state evolves to **unity and cooperation** as they work together to evade the SWAT team, forming strong bonds.\n- By event 5, the protagonist's state changes to **victory and secrecy** as they succeed in their mission to bring down Sullivan and then return to their normal lives, but with the added depth of shared experience and secret knowledge.\n\nGiven these changes in the protagonist's state, the story arc type can be classified based on the overall trajectory of the protagonist's condition throughout the story. The group starts in a low state of separation and ordinariness, rises to a state of excitement and anticipation, faces setbacks and dangers, but ultimately achieves a higher state of unity, cooperation, and victory, before returning to their normal lives but with a deeper connection and shared secret.\n\nThe determined story arc type is **Man in a Hole**."

Initially, the Riddler and their team are in a position of strength and control (Event 1). They then face a challenge with the discovery of the \"Titan Enigma\" (Event 2), which leads to a significant complication with the capture of Cipher (Event 3), placing them in a \"hole\" or a difficult situation. However, they recover from this setback with a daring plan to infiltrate Titan Corp (Event 4), and ultimately, they succeed in their mission, leading to a significant improvement in their condition and the condition of the city (Event 5).\n\nThis pattern follows the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (capture of Cipher, pursuit by syndicate and Titan Corp) but finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning (successful exposure of Titan Corp, public uprising, and city's liberation).\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To analyze the story arc of the given narrative, let's follow the instructions step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the protagonist and 5 major events in the story:**\n   - The protagonist of the story is Batman.\n   - Five major events in the story are:\n     1. The Joker interrupts the mob bosses' meeting and offers to kill Batman for half their money (sentence 6).\n     2. Batman captures Lau and delivers him back to Gotham to testify against the Joker and the mob (sentence 9).\n     3. The Joker kills Rachel and scars half of Dent's face, leading to a significant downfall for the protagonists (sentence 19).\n     4. The Joker rigs two ferries with explosives, giving the passengers a choice to blow the other up, but they ultimately refuse (sentence 28-30).\n     5. Batman confronts Dent, who has turned into a villain, and saves Gordon's son but decides to take the blame for Dent's crimes to preserve hope in Gotham (sentences 36-40).\n\n2. **Describe the protagonist's state and how it changed relative to the previous events:**\n   - At the first event (sentence 6), Batman's state is one of being targeted by the Joker, but he is still in control and working to apprehend the Joker. This is a challenging situation but not a low point.\n   - By the second event (sentence 9), Batman has gained the upper hand by capturing Lau, which is a positive development in his quest against the Joker and the mob.\n   - The third event (sentence 19) marks a significant low point for Batman, as the Joker succeeds in killing Rachel and disfiguring Dent, leading to a moral and emotional downturn.\n   - At the fourth event (sentences 28-30), while the situation is dire, Batman's efforts and the moral integrity of the ferry passengers prevent a catastrophe, which can be seen as a recovery or a moment of hope.\n   - The fifth event (sentences 36-40) shows Batman facing another low point, as he must confront the corrupted Dent and make a difficult choice to take the blame for Dent's actions to protect Gotham's hope. However, he also manages to save Gordon's son, which is a positive outcome.\n\n3. **Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain your reasoning:**\n   - The story starts with Batman in a position of being challenged by the Joker but still in control. He then faces a series of setbacks, including the failure to protect Rachel and Dent's corruption, which leads to a significant low point. However, through his actions and the resilience of the people of Gotham, there are moments of recovery and hope. Ultimately, Batman ends up in a sacrificial position, taking the blame for Dent's actions to maintain hope in Gotham, which is a complex mix of a low point and a noble act.\n   - Given these developments, the story arc does not fit neatly into a simple \"Rags to Riches\" or \"Riches to Rags\" pattern. Instead, it involves a cycle of challenge, downfall, and recovery, with the protagonist ultimately making a significant sacrifice for the greater good.\n   - The \"Man in a Hole\" story arc is characterized by the protagonist falling into a dilemma and then finding a way out, ending better than at the beginning. While Batman does face and overcome challenges, his final state is more complex, involving a personal sacrifice that, while noble, does not necessarily leave him in a better condition than when he started.\n\n4. **Determined story arc type:**\nMan in a Hole"

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonists in the story are Falcon and Hawk, two unstoppable pilots. However, for the purpose of analyzing the story arc, we can consider their collective journey as the focus, with an emphasis on Hawk's actions and emotions as the story progresses.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. **The Initial Battle**: Falcon and Hawk engage in an aerial battle against a rogue MIG 35 jet (sentences 1-6).\n2. **The Top-Secret Mission**: They are handpicked for a top-secret mission, which sparks controversy (sentences 9-14).\n3. **Falcon's Capture**: Falcon's jet is hit, and he becomes a captive of the enemy, leading to Hawk's decision to rescue him (sentences 19-22).\n4. **The Rescue Mission**: Hawk and a group of loyal comrades undertake a daring rescue operation to free Falcon (sentences 25-30).\n5. **The Final Confrontation and Resolution**: The rescue is successful, a traitor is revealed, and the protagonists ultimately return victorious, with their bond and reputation strengthened (sentences 31-47).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1 (The Initial Battle)**: The protagonists are in a high state, demonstrating expertise and successfully completing their mission. Their condition is one of triumph and unity with their crew.\n- **Event 2 (The Top-Secret Mission)**: Despite the controversy, they remain unfazed and ready for their new mission. Their state is still positive, with a sense of anticipation and duty.\n- **Event 3 (Falcon's Capture)**: This marks a significant downturn for the protagonists. Hawk is filled with remorse and grief, and their situation becomes dire. Their state changes to one of distress and urgency.\n- **Event 4 (The Rescue Mission)**: Hawk's decision to rescue Falcon shows a shift towards action and hope. Although the situation is dangerous, there's a sense of determination and camaraderie. Their state is one of risk and resilience.\n- **Event 5 (The Final Confrontation and Resolution)**: With the successful rescue, the revelation of the traitor, and their victorious return, the protagonists' state improves dramatically. They achieve a higher state of victory, respect, and strengthened bond, culminating in celebrations and renewed faith from their peers.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc can be classified based on how the protagonists' condition changes throughout the narrative. Initially, they are in a high state (success in the battle), then they face a challenge (controversy over the mission), followed by a significant downturn (Falcon's capture), and subsequently, they embark on a risky rescue mission. After overcoming this adversity, they achieve an even higher state than before (victory, revelation of the traitor, and strengthened bond).\n\nThis pattern suggests a **Double Man in a Hole** story arc because the protagonists face two major cycles of dilemma and recovery. The first cycle involves the challenge of the top-secret mission and its controversies, and the second, more significant cycle involves Falcon's capture and the subsequent rescue mission. Each cycle represents a fall into a difficult situation (a \"hole\") followed by a climb out of it, with the final state being higher than the initial one due to their ultimate victory and the strengthening of their bond.\n\n### 4.

However, since the story arc classification is typically applied to a single protagonist or a cohesive unit, we can consider Jake and Alex as a duo protagonist for the purpose of this analysis.\n\nThe 5 major events in the story are:\n1. The introduction of the serial murder case (sentence 3).\n2. The duo's investigation uncovers the city's social underbelly, and Alex becomes entangled in a dangerous spiral of gambling addiction (sentence 9).\n3. Jake and Alex bridge their differences and form a reluctant alliance to solve the case (sentence 12).\n4. They discover a puzzling hint that leads them to predict the mayor could be the murderer's next target (sentence 15).\n5. The duo successfully prevents the assassination of the mayor and apprehends the true culprit (sentences 18-21).\n\n### TASK 2: Describe the protagonist's state and how it changed relative to the previous events\n\n1. **Introduction of the serial murder case**: The duo protagonist (Jake and Alex) is in a state of professional stagnation and personal struggle. Jake is worn out, and Alex is overzealous but inexperienced. Their condition is relatively low due to the challenging case and their personal demons.\n2. **Investigation and Alex's addiction**: The protagonist's state worsens as Alex falls into a dangerous spiral of gambling addiction, and they face derision from their peers. This event lowers their condition further due to internal and external pressures.\n3. **Forming a reluctant alliance**: The duo's state begins to improve as they bridge their differences and work together more effectively. This marks a turning point where their condition starts to rise as they become more cohesive and determined.\n4. **Predicting the mayor's assassination**: The protagonist's state becomes more urgent and focused. They have made progress in the case and are now driven to prevent a significant crime. Their condition has improved from the previous low points.\n5. **Apprehending the true culprit**: The duo's state reaches its highest point as they successfully solve the case, prevent the mayor's assassination, and bring the perpetrator to justice. This event marks a significant improvement in their condition, both professionally and personally.\n\n### TASK 3: Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain your reasoning\n\nThe story arc type can be classified based on how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the narrative.

As the story progresses, they face further setbacks, such as Alex's addiction and the criticism from their peers, which worsen their condition. However, they then experience a series of improvements: forming a stronger partnership, making significant progress in the case, predicting and preventing the mayor's assassination, and finally apprehending the culprit. This pattern of falling into a dilemma (or multiple dilemmas) and then finding a way out, ending in a better state than at the beginning, aligns with the **Man in a Hole** story arc type.\n\n### TASK 4: Determine the story arc type\n\nMan in a Hole"

Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n- **Event 1**: John's state is one of desperation due to financial hardship, but discovering the Ferrari offers him a glimmer of hope for improving his situation.\n- **Event 2**: John's state transitions from desperation to moral conflict. He chooses not to steal the Ferrari, indicating a retention of his moral integrity despite his hardships.\n- **Event 3**: John's state worsens as he faces the consequences of his actions (or intended actions), leading to isolation and continued financial struggle.\n- **Event 4**: John's state begins to improve as he receives the proceeds from the sale of the Ferrari, alleviating his financial burdens.\n- **Event 5**: John's state significantly improves as he not only achieves financial stability but also finds love and acceptance, leading to a reunion with Gwen and a return to the Reid household.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc can be classified by analyzing the trajectory of the protagonist's condition throughout the narrative. Initially, John is in a disadvantaged situation (financial hardship). He then faces a moral dilemma and chooses the higher ground, but this leads to a temporary setback (feeling betrayed by Gwen and his isolation). However, the story takes a turn for the better as Gwen forgives him and helps him financially, leading to a significant improvement in John's condition (financial stability and finding love).\n\nThis pattern follows a specific story arc type where the protagonist rises, faces a setback, and ultimately achieves a higher state than where they started. The initial rise is John's discovery of the Ferrari and his decision not to steal it, showing moral growth. The setback is the temporary isolation and feeling of betrayal. The ultimate achievement of a higher state is John receiving the financial help and finding love with Gwen, ending in a better condition than at the beginning of the story.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonists of the story are Bonnie and Clyde, given that the narrative focuses on their adventures, relationship, and eventual downfall. Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. Bonnie and Clyde meet and decide to become partners in crime (sentences 1-2).\n2. The duo's crime spree escalates with the addition of new members, including C.W., Buck, and Blanche (sentences 4-5).\n3. Bonnie and Clyde's exploits become more violent and they start robbing banks (sentences 7-10).\n4. The gang is pursued by law enforcement, leading to a raid that mortally wounds Buck and injures Blanche (sentences 11-12).\n5. Bonnie and Clyde are ambushed and killed by the police (sentences 20-22).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1**: Bonnie and Clyde meet, and Bonnie decides to join Clyde in his criminal activities. At this point, Bonnie's state changes from boredom with her job to excitement and anticipation of a new life. Clyde's state also improves as he gains a partner.\n  \n- **Event 2**: With the addition of C.W., Buck, and Blanche, their crime spree becomes more organized but also introduces internal conflicts, especially between Bonnie and Blanche. Their state improves in terms of notoriety and possibly financial gain but worsens in terms of interpersonal dynamics.\n\n- **Event 3**: As they turn to bank robberies and their actions become more violent, Bonnie and Clyde's state peaks in terms of notoriety and possibly financial success, but they also become more wanted by the law, introducing a significant risk to their well-being.\n\n- **Event 4**: The raid that wounds Buck and injures Blanche marks a significant downturn in their state. They suffer losses within their group, and the law is closing in. This event signifies a decline in their condition as they face more direct and severe consequences of their actions.\n\n- **Event 5**: The final event, where Bonnie and Clyde are ambushed and killed, represents the lowest point in their state. All their gains, in terms of freedom, notoriety, and wealth, are lost, and they pay the ultimate price for their actions.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc of Bonnie and Clyde follows a pattern where the protagonists start in a relatively low state (boredom and small-time crime), rise to a peak of success and notoriety (bank robberies and evasion of the law), and then plummet to a tragic end (ambush and death). This pattern matches the **Icarus** story arc type, where the protagonist rises to success but then faces a drastic downfall. The key characteristic of the Icarus arc is the significant rise followed by an equally significant fall, which is precisely what happens to Bonnie and Clyde as they ascend to fame as outlaws but ultimately meet a violent end.\n\n### 4.

The news brings uncertainty and a call to action, slightly disrupting their tranquility.\n\n2. **Detention by Colonel Spalko:** The protagonists' state worsens significantly as they are captured and confined within the fortress.

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe story revolves around four main characters: Mr. Crimson, Mr. Sapphire, Mr. Graphite, and Mr. Bronze. However, for the purpose of analyzing the story arc, we can consider Mr. Bronze as the central figure whose actions and decisions significantly impact the plot's progression, especially in the latter half.\n\nThe five major events in the story are:\n1. The four protagonists board the metro train as part of their heist plan (Event 19).\n2. Mr. Crimson identifies an undercover cop on the train, escalating tension (Event 22).\n3. Mr. Bronze aids the cop by sending a coded SMS, revealing details of their heist plan (Event 41).\n4. The team discovers Mr. Bronze's betrayal, leading to a confrontation (Event 51).\n5. The story concludes with a deadly standoff between the remaining team members and the cops, with Mr. Bronze sitting alone, reflecting on his actions (Event 58).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **Event 19 (Boarding the Metro):** Mr. Bronze is part of a cohesive team, working together towards a common goal. His state is one of collaboration and focus on the heist.\n2. **Event 22 (Discovery of the Undercover Cop):** The team's situation becomes tense, but Mr. Bronze's personal state remains one of caution and adherence to the plan. He is still committed to the team's objective.\n3. **Event 41 (Aiding the Cop):** Mr. Bronze's state shifts significantly as he begins to question his morals and eventually decides to betray his team. This marks a turning point in his personal conflict and loyalty.\n4. **Event 51 (Confrontation Due to Betrayal):** Mr. Bronze's state is one of isolation and guilt. His actions have led to a rift within the team, and he faces confrontation and mistrust from his former allies.\n5. **Event 58 (Deadly Standoff):** Mr. Bronze is now alone, both physically and emotionally. His state is reflective, suggesting a deep internal conflict and possibly regret over his decisions.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on Mr. Bronze's condition throughout the story, we observe a significant decline from being part of a united team working towards a goal to being isolated and facing internal turmoil due to his betrayal. His state transitions from collaboration and focus to guilt, isolation, and potential regret. This trajectory aligns with a story arc where the protagonist starts in a relatively high or advantageous position but ends in a significantly lower state, both in terms of their personal relationships and their moral standing.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identify the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Helen, a seasoned systems engineer. Five major events in the story are:\n1. The distress signal is received, and the crew is awakened from hibernation (sentence 5).\n2. Helen discovers the nanotechnological invader taking over the ship's system (sentence 11).\n3. The crew discovers Dr. Karl's duplicitous involvement with the Kepler-Dyson Corporation (sentence 17).\n4.

Alex sacrifices himself to initiate the nanotech neutralization, saving the crew and the ship (sentences 20-25).\n\n### 2. Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **Event 1 (Distress Signal):** Helen's state changes from calm and possibly unaware of the impending danger to alerted and ready to face the challenge. She moves from a state of serenity to one of urgency and action.\n2. **Event 2 (Discovery of Nanotech Invader):** Helen's state worsens as she realizes the severity of the situation. She moves from being ready to face a challenge to being confronted with a potentially catastrophic problem that threatens the entire crew and ship.\n3. **Event 3 (Dr. Karl's Betrayal):** Helen's state becomes even more dire as she learns of Dr. Karl's involvement with the enemy. This betrayal complicates the situation, making it not just a technical problem but also a matter of trust and loyalty within the crew.\n4. **Event 4 (Solution to Annihilate Nanotech):** Helen's state slightly improves as she finds a potential solution to their problem. However, the solution requires a risky and dangerous action, which still keeps the overall situation tense and uncertain.\n5. **Event 5 (Alex's Sacrifice):** Helen's state, along with the crew's, is marked by sadness and loss due to Alex's sacrifice. However, they also experience relief and gratitude because the ship and most of the crew are saved. This event brings a sense of closure and resolution to the crisis, albeit at a significant cost.\n\n### 3. Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story arc can be classified based on how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the narrative. Initially, Helen is in a state of readiness and competence. As the story progresses, she faces significant challenges (the nanotech invader, Dr. Karl's betrayal) that worsen her situation. However, she never gives up and continues to work towards a solution. The story reaches its climax with Alex's sacrifice, which is a tragic event but also leads to the resolution of the main conflict. After this event, Helen and the remaining crew are in a state of reflection and mourning but are also safe and on the path to recovery.\n\nGiven these changes, the story follows a pattern where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (receiving the distress signal and discovering the nanotech invader) and then finds a way out (Helen's relentless pursuit of a solution and Alex's ultimate sacrifice). The protagonist's condition improves from the lowest point (after discovering Dr. Karl's betrayal and before finding a solution) to the final state (having saved the ship but at a great personal cost).\n\n### 4.

the Alien into an airlock, but it ambushes him.\n20) When the others find no trace of Dallas, Lambert, realizing that the alien is aggressive and intent on killing the entire crew, implores the remaining crew members to escape in the ship's shuttle.\n21) Ripley, now in command, explains that the shuttle will not support four people, and recommends that they continue with Dallas's plan of cornering and flushing out the Alien.\n22) Accessing the ship's computer, Ripley discovers that Ash has been ordered to return the Alien to their corporate employers even at the expense of the crew's lives.\n23) Ash then appears and attacks Ripley, but Parker and Lambert intervene, decapitating and impaling Ash, revealing him to be an android.\n24) Ripley theorizes that the company wants the Alien for its weapons division.\n25) Before they destroy his remains, Ash smugly predicts that the others will not survive the indestructible \"perfect organism\" that they are up against.\n26) The three remaining crew members then agree to arm the Nostromo's self-destruct mechanism and escape in the shuttle, but Parker and Lambert are ambushed and killed by the Alien while gathering necessary coolant supplies.\n27) Now alone, Ripley initiates the self-destruct sequence herself and heads for the shuttle with the crew's cat, but finds the Alien blocking her way.\n28) She retreats and unsuccessfully attempts to abort the self-destruct, then returns to find the Alien gone and narrowly escapes in the shuttle as the Nostromo explodes.\n29) As she prepares to enter stasis, Ripley discovers that the Alien has hidden aboard the shuttle.\n30) She puts on a spacesuit and opens the shuttle's main door, causing explosive decompression which forces the Alien to the shuttle's open doorway.\n31) She propels it out into space by shooting it with a grappling hook, but the gun catches in the closing door, tethering the Alien to the shuttle.\n32) As it attempts to crawl into one of the engines, Ripley activates them and blasts the alien into space.\n33) She then puts herself and Jones the cat into stasis and resumes the voyage back home.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonist of the story is Warrant Officer Ripley (Sigourney Weaver). \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. The crew discovers the derelict alien spacecraft and the chamber with thousands of eggs (sentences 5-8).\n2. The alien creature bursts from Kane's chest, killing him, and escapes into the ship (sentence 15).\n3. Ripley discovers that Ash has been ordered to return the Alien to their corporate employers, even at the expense of the crew's lives, and Ash is revealed to be an android (sentences 22-23).\n4. The remaining crew members decide to arm the Nostromo's self-destruct mechanism and escape in the shuttle, but most are killed by the Alien (sentences 26).\n5. Ripley successfully escapes from the Nostromo in the shuttle and manages to blast the Alien into space (sentences 28-32).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. **Discovery of the Alien Spacecraft**: At the beginning, Ripley is in stasis, then awakened to investigate a mysterious signal. Her state changes from passive (in stasis) to active (investigating the signal), but she is not yet in a position of significant danger or responsibility.\n2. **The Alien's Escape**: After the creature kills Kane, Ripley's state changes dramatically. She moves from a state of curiosity and caution to one of urgency and danger. The crew is now under attack, and Ripley must take actions to protect herself and others.\n3. **Discovery of Ash's True Intentions**: Ripley's state worsens as she discovers Ash's betrayal. She faces not only the external threat of the Alien but also an internal threat from one of their own crew members. This betrayal adds to the complexity of her situation and increases her danger.\n4. **Decision to Self-Destruct the Nostromo**: As the crew members are picked off by the Alien, Ripley's state becomes more desperate. She loses companions and faces the reality of their situation, leading to a decision that is both dangerous and necessary for survival.\n5. **Escape from the Nostromo**: Finally, Ripley successfully escapes the Nostromo and kills the Alien. Her state changes from one of desperation and danger to one of relief and survival. She has overcome significant obstacles and threats to emerge victorious, albeit scarred by her experiences.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, Ripley starts in a relatively safe and stable situation (in stasis on the spaceship), falls into a series of worsening dilemmas (discovery of the alien, its escape, Ash's betrayal, and the crew's deaths), and then finds a way out of these dilemmas by escaping and killing the Alien. This pattern fits the **Man in a Hole** story arc type, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (or series of dilemmas) and then recovers, ending in a better state than they were in at the worst point of their journey.\n\n### 4.

Five major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Richard's successful stand-up performance** (sentences 1-2): This event showcases Richard's professional success and charm on stage.\n2. **The revelation of Richard's deep loneliness** (sentences 5-6): After his performance, the scene shifts to reveal Richard's empty and lonely personal life despite his professional success.\n3. **Richard's introduction to therapy and a support group** (sentences 14-15): This marks a turning point where Richard begins to address his personal issues.\n4. **Richard's breakthrough in therapy** (sentence 19): Richard finally breaks down and releases years of suppressed feelings, marking a significant shift in his emotional state.\n5. **Richard's return to stand-up comedy with a newfound perspective** (sentences 22-24): After therapy and introspection, Richard returns to comedy but with a more authentic and confessional style.\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **At the first event (successful stand-up performance)**: Richard appears to be at the top of his career, charming, and successful. His state is one of professional triumph.\n- **At the second event (revelation of loneliness)**: Richard's state shifts to one of deep loneliness and isolation, contrasting sharply with his professional success. This is a downward turn in his personal life.\n- **At the third event (introduction to therapy)**: Richard begins to seek help for his issues, indicating a recognition of his problems and a desire to change. His state is one of initial vulnerability and openness to improvement.\n- **At the fourth event (breakthrough in therapy)**: Richard experiences a significant emotional release, marking a turning point towards healing and personal growth. His state improves as he begins to confront and overcome his deep-seated issues.\n- **At the fifth event (return to stand-up with a new perspective)**: Richard's state has improved significantly; he is more authentic, has found a way to express his emotions through comedy, and is on the path to reconciling his personal and professional life.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nThe story follows Richard as he falls from a high point of professional success into a deep personal crisis (the revelation of his loneliness and the decline of his comedy shows), and then rises again as he seeks and finds help through therapy, leading to a transformative realization and a return to his profession with a newfound sense of purpose and authenticity. This pattern does not fit the \"Rags to Riches\" arc, as Richard starts in a position of success. It also doesn't perfectly align with \"Riches to Rags\" since Richard ends in a better state than he began. The closest match is the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma (Richard's loneliness and decline) and then finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning. Richard's journey from success, through a period of personal struggle, and back to success but with greater personal fulfillment and authenticity, aligns with this arc.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "### 1. Identify the protagonist and 5 major events in the story\n\nThe protagonist in the story is Dr. John Collins, a renowned anatomy professor at Harvard University. \n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. John discovers eerie parallels between his anatomical illustrations and Liz's macabre stage settings (event 5).\n2. John finds a sinister anatomy lab in Liz's basement rehearsal studio, hinting at a chilling narrative (event 9).\n3. John realizes that several of his brilliant anatomy students have disappeared, leaving behind only traceless absentee letters (event 13).\n4. John discovers the horrifying truth that Liz has been stealing organs from his missing students for use as props in her productions (event 16).\n5. John confronts Liz, leading to a near-apocalyptic clash that ultimately results in the revelation of her inhuman activities to the Harvard community and the police (events 25-29).\n\n### 2. Describe the protagonist's state and how it changed at each event\n\n- **Event 1 (Discovery of eerie parallels):** John starts to feel a sense of unease and curiosity about Liz's activities. His state changes from being confident in his relationship and professional life to being slightly unsettled and inquisitive.\n- **Event 2 (Discovery of the sinister lab):** John's unease deepens into fear and suspicion. His state deteriorates as he begins to question Liz's integrity and the nature of their relationship.\n- **Event 3 (Realization of student disappearances):** John's fear turns into alarm and desperation. His state worsens as he struggles to connect the dots between the disappearances and Liz's activities, feeling overwhelmed by the implications.\n- **Event 4 (Discovery of the truth about Liz):** John's world is shattered. His state hits a low point as he grapples with the horrific truth about the woman he loves, feeling betrayed, shocked, and dismayed.\n- **Event 5 (Confrontation with Liz and its aftermath):** John, though emotionally battered, finds the strength to stand up against Liz and expose her crimes. His state improves slightly as he takes action, but he remains emotionally wounded. The confrontation and subsequent validation of his claims by the police investigation mark a turning point where John begins to recover and find justice, albeit at a great personal cost.\n\n### 3. Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain the reasoning\n\nThe story arc can be classified based on how the protagonist's condition changes throughout the narrative. Initially, John is in a high state, being a renowned professor with a promising relationship. However, as the story progresses, he falls into a deep dilemma upon discovering the truth about Liz and her horrific deeds. This downfall is marked by his emotional turmoil, fear, and the shattering of his personal and professional life. \n\nAfter hitting this low point, John begins to recover by taking action against Liz, which leads to her downfall and the exposure of her crimes. This act of standing up against her and seeking justice can be seen as a recovery phase where John's condition starts to improve. However, the story also hints at a subsequent challenge or potential downfall with the introduction of the new drama professor, whose style eerily mirrors Liz's, suggesting that the cycle of horror might not be fully broken.\n\nGiven these elements, the story seems to follow a pattern where the protagonist starts high, falls into a deep crisis, recovers to some extent by taking action, but then faces the possibility of another significant challenge or downfall. This pattern aligns with the **Oedipus** story arc type, which is characterized by a protagonist who starts in a high position, falls, recovers, and then faces another significant downfall or challenge.\n\n### 4.

        "output": "To classify the story arc type, let's first identify the protagonist and 5 major events in the story.\n\n1. The protagonist of the story is Thomas Smith, a skilled safe cracker.\n2.

However, meeting Johnny and learning about the stolen totem presents an opportunity for adventure and leaving a mark on history, which slightly improves his state.\n- By Event 2, Thomas's state has improved as he becomes engaged in planning and strategizing the heist, indicating a rise in his condition due to the thrill and purpose it gives him.\n- At Event 3, Thomas's state peaks as they successfully recover the tribal totem, achieving their goal and overcoming significant obstacles.\n- Event 4 brings a downfall as Thomas learns about the hidden alliances, introducing conflict and mistrust, which worsens his state.\n- By Event 5, Thomas's state has further declined as he surrenders to the authorities, indicating a significant drop from his peak at Event 3.\n\nGiven these changes in the protagonist's condition, the story arc type can be classified based on the pattern of improvement followed by a drastic downfall. The protagonist starts in a disadvantaged situation, rises to a peak of success, and then faces a significant downfall, fitting the description of a specific story arc type.\n\nThe determined story arc type is Icarus."

        "output": "### 1. Identifying the Protagonist and Major Events\n\nThe protagonists in this story are Queen Nefertiti and priest Amenhotep, as the narrative revolves around their forbidden love and the consequences that follow. However, for the purpose of analyzing the story arc, we will consider their joint experiences as the focal point.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n1. The introduction of the royal couple and the priest, setting the stage for the story (sentences 1-3).\n2. The discovery of the secret affair by a local tradesman, leading to chaos and the pursuit of Amenhotep (sentences 10-14).\n3. The lovers' daring escape from Thebes, aided by Nefertiti's bravery and Amenhotep's knowledge of the city (sentences 17-22).\n4. The decision to return to Thebes and confront King Akhenaten, marking a turning point in their fate (sentences 26-27).\n5. The final resolution, where King Akhenaten grants them exile, and they find peace in a new home (sentences 30-44).\n\n### 2. Describing the Protagonist's State and Changes\n\n- **Event 1 (Introduction):** The protagonists are introduced in a state of high social standing but with underlying tension and forbidden love. Nefertiti is in a loveless marriage, and Amenhotep is bound by his priestly duties. Their state is one of hidden desire and compliance with societal norms.\n  \n- **Event 2 (Discovery of the Affair):** Their state drastically worsens as they face the consequences of their discovered affair. They go from being respected members of society to being fugitives, with Amenhotep being pursued by the king's guards. This marks a significant downfall in their social standing and personal safety.\n\n- **Event 3 (Escape from Thebes):** Although they manage to escape, their state remains precarious. They are on the run, facing dangers from both the desert and their pursuers. However, they are together, which gives them a sense of hope and freedom.\n\n- **Event 4 (Return to Thebes):** Deciding to return and face King Akhenaten is a brave move that shows their determination to be together and challenge societal norms. Their state is one of resolve and bravery, but also uncertainty about their future.\n\n- **Event 5 (Final Resolution):** Ultimately, they are granted exile, which allows them to start a new life together, free from the constraints of Thebes. This marks a significant improvement in their state, as they achieve a peaceful existence, freedom to love each other openly, and a chance to rebuild their lives.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nAnalyzing the protagonist's condition throughout the story:\n- They start in a high social standing but with personal unfulfillment (Event 1).\n- Face a significant downfall upon the discovery of their affair (Event 2).\n- Show resilience and bravery in their escape and decision to return (Events 3 and 4).\n- Ultimately achieve a higher state of personal fulfillment and peace in their exile (Event 5).\n\nThis pattern follows the **Cinderella** story arc type, where the protagonist rises, faces a setback, and ultimately achieves a higher state. The initial high social standing, followed by a drastic fall, and then a brave comeback to achieve a peaceful and loving life, aligns with the Cinderella arc.\n\n### 4.

Her state is one of desperation and hopelessness.\n- **Event 2 (sentence 14):** Rose's state has improved as she has found a connection with Jack, offering her a sense of freedom and happiness she hadn't experienced before. This marks a positive turn in her emotional state.\n- **Event 3 (sentence 19):** Rose's situation becomes complicated again as she is forced to confront the consequences of her relationship with Jack, now that Cal is aware of it. Her state is one of anxiety and conflict.\n- **Event 4 (sentence 23):** Rose takes action to rescue Jack, showing determination and courage. Her state has shifted towards empowerment and love, as she prioritizes her feelings for Jack over her obligations to Cal.\n- **Event 5 (sentence 35):** After Jack's death, Rose is left in a state of grief and loss. However, she is also alive and has the opportunity to rebuild her life, inspired by her experiences with Jack.\n\n### 3. Classifying the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, the narrative does not fit neatly into a simple \"Riches to Rags\" category as initially classified. Instead, Rose's journey involves a transformation from a state of despair and entrapment to one of empowerment and eventual loss, but with a lasting positive impact on her life. \n\nThe story begins with Rose in a metaphorical \"hole\" due to her unwanted engagement and societal pressures. She then experiences a rise as she finds love and freedom with Jack, which represents an improvement in her condition. However, this is followed by a tragic downfall with Jack's death, leaving her in a state of grief. Despite this, the story concludes on a hopeful note, with Rose having been inspired by her time with Jack and implied to have lived a fulfilling life thereafter.\n\nThis pattern more closely aligns with a narrative where the protagonist faces challenges, rises above them, suffers a setback, but ultimately achieves a form of redemption or closure. Given the provided story arc types, the closest match would be the \"Cinderella\" story arc, which involves a rise, a setback, and ultimately achieving a higher state, though the traditional \"Cinderella\" arc typically ends on a more overtly positive note.\n\nHowever, considering the complexity of Rose's journey and the emphasis on her personal growth and the bittersweet nature of her story, it might also be argued to resemble aspects of other story arcs, such as \"Man in a Hole\" due to her initial desperation and subsequent rescue through her relationship with Jack, followed by her resilience in the face of tragedy.\n\n### 4.
