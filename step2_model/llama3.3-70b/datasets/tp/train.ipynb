      "9) Diane loses the urn containing her deceased husband Harry’s ashes, which she has illegally brought into the country, hidden in her suitcase.\n",
      "10) Sharon calls the police chief who attends them lazy for his treatment of the theft.\n",
      "11) Carol points out that their experience is like what happened to a character in Paolo Coelho's The Alchemist, so they should treat it as part of their adventure too.\n",
