      "1) The beginning of the movie is showcased with a high-octane sequence featuring Alliance 127, a commercial Boeing 777, falling victim to a hijack.\n",
      "2) The consequent turmoil that ensues as the ill-fated plane meets its tragic end in a devastating crash is presented through a series of heart-wrenching sequences.\n",
      "3) Leapfrogging to 2020, the narrative presents John Decker, a veteran CIA agent, being handed a classified report about Alliance 127.\n",
      "4) The case is being reopened, due to the revelation of fresh evidence discovered amidst the debris of the crash site.\n",
      "5) John, intrigued by the persisting anomalies that had marred the initial investigations, delves deep into the buried case files, seeking connections that previously slipped attention.\n",
      "6) Assembling a team of relentless pursuers from different CIA branches, John includes Sarah Wilson, an audacious and brilliant field operative known for her ability to thrive under pressure.\n",
      "7) Their relentless probe yields disconcerting leads that suggest a premeditated hijacking, turning the narrative on its head.\n",
      "8) A comprehensive background check of the passengers puts a spotlight on nefarious connections connecting some of them to notorious underworld figures and high-ranking government officials.\n",
      "9) Unknown enemies target Sarah with brutal precision, culminating in a shocking personal tragedy - the suspicious car crash that claims her brother Robert's life.\n",
      "10) As they bore deeper into the case, 'Legacy', an obscure anti-terrorism operation, emerges as a potential cipher, capable of shedding light on their gnarly quest for the truth.\n",

      "12) It's revealed to be an inside job, with government tiers connected to the conspiracy.\n",
      "13) As John and his team grapple with collecting evidence against the powerful traitors, a deadly cat-and-mouse game ensues.\n",
      "14) Meanwhile, Sarah undertakes a daring mission to infiltrate a base camp operated by the enemy.\n",
      "15) In what follows, Sarah engages in an adrenaline-pumping chase to dodge her pursuers, barely managing to escape with the crucial evidence.\n",
      "16) However, a jarring plot twist waits as a bullet strikes Sarah before she can completely evade capture.\n",
      "17) In her final moments, she hands over the evidence to John.\n",
      "18) Armed with the retrieved evidence, John wages a relentless battle against the corrupt officials.\n",
      "19) As the malicious web behind the Alliance 127 incident unravels, a chilling truth casts a grim shadow over the international political panorama.\n",
      "20) Yet, the resolution offers some relief as the innocent victims of the flight are exonerated posthumously.\n",
      "21) The movie wraps up with emotionally stirring scenes, etching Sarah's ultimate sacrifice in the hearts of the audience, whose valorous spirit is immortalized by John as he lays a single red rose on her grave.\n",
