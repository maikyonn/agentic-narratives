        "output": "### TASK RESPONSE\n\n1. **Identify the protagonist in the story:** \n   Although Louis Armstrong plays a crucial role in the story, the actual protagonist of the story is Harold Roberts. This is because the story revolves around Roberts' transformation and growth, while Armstrong serves as a catalyst for this change.\n\n2. **First Turning Point (Opportunity):**\n   Sentence 4: \"He remained resilient, asserting his powerful presence in a predominantly white-dominated music industry and promoting his liberating jazz music.\"\n   Although this sentence describes Louis Armstrong, it sets the stage for Roberts' opportunity to meet Armstrong and initiate his journey. However, the actual sentence that describes Roberts' state at the first turning point is Sentence 5: \"In the throbbing nucleus of the WNYC radio station, Harold Roberts meticulously curated his popular radio show, 'The Roberts Hour.'\"\n   **Protagonist's State:** At this point, Roberts is successful and influential in his radio career, but he is also entrenched in his biases and uses his platform to foster racial discrimination. His condition can be approximated as 6, as he has a good career but a flawed character.\n\n3. **Second Turning Point (Change of Plans):**\n   Sentence 8: \"Unbeknownst to Armstrong, Roberts was plotting an on-air confrontation to challenge and undermine his beliefs, thinking this would fortify his influence.\"\n   **Change in Protagonist's State:** At this point, Roberts is still confident in his own biases and is trying to use his platform to undermine Armstrong's message. His condition remains at 6, as his character has not changed yet.\n\n4. **Third Turning Point (Point of No Return):**\n   Sentence 17: \"Armourstrong responded fervently to every antagonistic question, displaying courage and resolve that left both Roberts and the critical listeners profoundly dumbfounded.\"\n   **Change in Protagonist's State:** At this point, Roberts is starting to question his own biases and is becoming increasingly unsettled by Armstrong's arguments. His condition can be approximated as 4, as he is beginning to realize his mistakes but has not yet changed.\n\n5. **Fourth Turning Point (Major Setback):**\n   Sentence 19: \"However, not everyone looked at this development positively; Armstrong started receiving a torrent of threats from Roberts' followers.\"\n   **Change in Protagonist's State:** At this point, Roberts is faced with the consequences of his actions and is starting to see the harm caused by his biases. His condition can be approximated as 2, as he is struggling with the repercussions of his mistakes.\n\n6. **Fifth Turning Point (Climax):**\n   Sentence 22: \"In an unprecedented move, Roberts decided to issue a public apology during his live radio segment.\"\n   **Change in Protagonist's State:** At this point, Roberts has finally found the courage to confront his mistakes and is taking steps to rectify them. His condition can be approximated as 8, as he is on the path to redemption and growth.\n\n7. **Protagonist's Condition List:** \n   The list of numbers describing the protagonist's condition in chronological order is: 6, 6, 4, 2, 8.\n\n8. **Story Arc Classification:** \n   Based on the protagonist's condition list, the story arc type can be classified as **Man in a Hole**. This is because the protagonist starts in a relatively good condition, falls into a worse state as he faces challenges and setbacks, and ultimately rises to a better condition as he learns and grows from his mistakes.\n\n9. **Determined Story Arc Type:** \n   Man in a Hole"

what's more, Kevin's wife has already been \"shifted\" twice, without anything being noticed.\n11) Kevin is skeptical and asks the Benefactor to prove it, suggesting that Tina, a waitress in the caf\u00e9, be \"shifted\" for demonstration.\n12) The Benefactor does just that, then informing Kevin that he's intentionally \"shifted\" Tina to a universe in which she's never existed, and that such \"shifts\" are cruel because of deranging effects on the \"shifted\" person's psyche.\n13) Realizing that this action will drive Tina insane, Kevin begins to say under his breath a prayer to God for help.\n14) Enraged, the Benefactor snarls that he'll never leave Kevin alone and that he's better than God and certainly better than Kevin, before vanishing abruptly and leaving Kevin trapped in that dystopian universe.\n15) Horrified at what he's just done, Kevin apologizes to Tina's family and leaves.\n16) Five years later, Kevin is still in the totalitarian reality, living under an assumed name because of \"illicit prayer\" at the caf\u00e9 by \"Kevin who refused\".\n17) In that universe, most of the planet was destroyed by constant war and anthropogenic activity with deleterious environmental impact.\n18) At first the \"shifters\" operated in secret, moving between alternate universes and exiling anybody regarded as \"problematic\" by the regime, with the help of small wrist-worn shifting devices called \"deviators\"; with millions of people vanished without trace, order could be restored in remaining areas of human habitation.\n19) After the Benefactor arrived and the surviving world leaders ceded control to him, he made the world over in his image.\n20) Majority of people live in squalid, poverty-stricken cities ruled with an iron fist by the Benefactor's secret police.\n21) Kevin attempts to write down from memory as many passages from the Bible and as closely to original text as he can remember and distributes the typed pages through his friend Gabriel, despite Scripture being illegal.\n22) Kevin also shares the story of Job with his neighbor, Rajit, and his family.\n23) Kevin's only solace is going to a movie theater owned by Russo, which plays a live feed from the viewer's direct doppelgangers in alternate realities.\n24) In the theater, Kevin sees several versions of Molly, one of which is a single mother working as a nurse and still wearing a necklace that Kevin bought for her before their estrangement and which only the \"original\" Molly wore until she was replaced by the Benefactor with her doppelganger.\n25) Kevin plans to obtain a deviator from one of the \"shifters\", but their identities are secret.\n26) Kevin hears an announcement on TV that the Benefactor is returning to that reality for the first time in five years, and acquires an illegal firearm from Gabriel, intending to force the Benefactor to take him back to his previous life in the old reality.\n27) However, the plan fails and the police open fire during a raid on Rajit's adjacent apartment, wounding Rajit and knocking Gabriel unconscious.\n28) Kevin sees a deviator on Gabriel's wrist and realizes that Gabriel has been one of the Benefactor's secret \"shifters\" all along, shifting himself to another reality with Gabriel's deviator.\n29) Kevin shifts through several universes, in one of them coming across Tina, who is unhinged and in a psychiatric ward.\n30) The next shift with the deviator brings him back to his bullet-riddled apartment in the dystopian reality.\n31) He runs to Russo's cinema and together they are able to identify the other universe from which the view of Molly with the necklace originates; after feeding the coordinates into the deviator, Kevin is shifted to that universe.\n32) Molly in that universe is upset by conversation with Kevin, suggesting that they both should move on and reminding him that break-up of their marriage was initiated by him - but Kevin also feels that their relationship could be still revived.\n33) Suddenly the Benefactor returns Kevin to the totalitarian universe, shifts Tina to Russo's cinema and tells Kevin that he should choose between restoring Tina to her family (never to see Molly again) and staying with Molly forever after accepting the Benefactor's offer to become his shifter.\n34) Kevin decides to give Tina her life back, and immediately after that he's suddenly shifted to another reality.\n35) In that reality, Molly is the nurse and single mother he saw previously and doesn't recognise him.\n36) He strikes up a conversation similar to their first meeting, and the two get married once again.\n37) Kevin states that although this is not his universe, it is his home.\n38) He's seen playing with his newborn son and his adopted daughter, proving that he was given double what he lost.\n39) In a post-credits scene, Kristoffer Polaha (who portrays Kevin in the film) thanks all viewers for watching the film and briefly mentions the inspirations for its screenplay and behind its production.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better (e.g., 0\u21921\u21922\u21924\u219210)\n- Riches to Rags: Protagonist starts high and ends lower (e.g., 10\u21929\u21928\u21926\u21920)\n- Man in a Hole: Protagonist falls into trouble but recovers (e.g., 6\u21922\u21921\u21924\u219210)\n- Icarus: Protagonist rises then falls dramatically (e.g., 2\u21924\u21929\u21925\u21921)\n- Double Man in a Hole: Two cycles of fall and recovery (e.g., 6\u21922\u21927\u21924\u219210)\n- Cinderella: Rise, setback, ultimate triumph (e.g., 1\u21927\u21924\u21921\u219210)\n- Oedipus: Start high, fall, recover, final fall (e.g., 10\u21924\u21927\u21929\u21921)\n\nGround Truth Turning Points:\n- Opportunity (tp1): 7.0 - Introductory event that occurs after presenting the setting and background of the main characters.\n- Change of Plans (tp2): 10.0 - Event where the main goal of the story is defined, starting the main action.\n- Point of No Return (tp3): 13.0 - Event that pushes the main character(s) to fully commit to their goal.\n- Major Setback (tp4): 27.0 - Event where things fall apart temporarily or permanently.\n- Climax (tp5): 34.0 - Final event/resolution of the main story (the \"biggest spoiler\").",

The first turning point is at sentence 6: \"The next morning, she asks Susanna why people dislike Theo.\" At this point, Theo's state is one of ignorance about the reasons behind people's dislike for him, but also a sense of unease due to the strange occurrences in the house. His condition can be approximated as a 6, as he is still in a relatively stable situation, but with growing concerns.\n\n3. The second turning point is at sentence 11: \"One evening, while she is taking a bath, Theo checks the messages on her phone and laptop.\" At this point, Theo's state has changed to one of heightened suspicion and mistrust towards Susanna, driven by his jealousy. His condition has worsened to a 4, as his relationships and mental state begin to deteriorate.\n\n4. The third turning point is at sentence 21: \"Ella and Theo get separated; the two of them appear to be experiencing separate visions in the dream world.\" At this point, Theo's state has become one of desperation and fear, as he loses control of the situation and his daughter. His condition has dropped to a 2, as he faces a critical and terrifying moment.\n\n5. The fourth turning point is at sentence 23: \"He then calls the shopkeeper, inquiring whether he knows of any cab services in the area.\" At this point, Theo's state is one of hopelessness and despair, as he realizes the impossibility of escape and the true nature of the house. His condition remains at a 2, as he is unable to find a way out of his dire situation.\n\n6. The fifth turning point is at sentence 31.5 (approximated, as the turning point is not explicitly a sentence): Theo's spirit is trapped inside the house, and he accepts his fate. At this point, Theo's state is one of resignation and defeat, as he acknowledges his past mistakes and the consequences that have led him to this point. His condition has dropped to a 0, as he faces the worst possible outcome.\n\n7. The list of protagonist's conditions in chronological order is: 6, 4, 2, 2, 0.\n\n8. Based on the protagonist's condition list, the story arc type can be classified as \"Riches to Rags\". This is because Theo starts in a relatively stable situation (6) and gradually descends into a desperate and hopeless state (0), with no significant improvements or recoveries throughout the story. The continuous decline in his condition matches the characteristic worsening of the protagonist's situation in the \"Riches to Rags\" story arc type.\n\n9. Riches to Rags"

quaint, colonial-style houses, lives a thoughtful teenager named Sarah Thompson within the tender embrace of her doting parents, Mark and Laura.\n3) Unlike many teenagers, Sarah's unique prowess lay in her deep introverted character and voracious curiosity for mysteries.\n4) Each free hour she found was lost in the riveting pages of detective novels like those by Agatha Christie and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.\n5) As the calendar marked December, Oakville transformed.\n6) But, within these harmonious happenings, Sarah was beginning to notice a strange pattern.\n7) Trivial things like moderate relocations of furniture or sudden appearances of cutlery in strange places started raising unsettling questions, sowing seeds of doubt and concern in her mind.\n8) As the nights grew longer, Sarah began to sense an unnatural thickness in the air.\n9) In disturbing interruptions of the night silence, she would hear cryptic whispers of miscreants, she noted the subtle displacement of household items, and most disconcerting of all, an uncanny feeling of being watched by an unknown entity.\n10) One clear December night, Sarah discerned a hazy figure through her bedroom window.\n11) With fear nestling in her heart, and curiosity fuelling her resolve, Sarah decided she couldn't let this masked intruder become a threat to her family.\n12) She chose to challenge this unknown terror.\n13) Determined, Sarah embarked on a journey to the Oakville police station, riding her faithful old bicycle under the chilly winter sky.\n14) To her dismay, the local police dismissed her allegations, attributing them to an overactive imagination which they believed was induced by her excessive indulgence in detective literature.\n15) This setback, however, did not dishearten Sarah.\n16) Her resolve hardened, and she decided to conduct her private investigation, much akin to the detectives in her novels.\n17) Sarah invested her considerable energy into observing the neighborhood through her wide-rimmed glasses and found shocking similarities in her neighbors' experiences.\n18) Combining the various shreds of gathered information, Sarah made a shocking connection.\n19) The disturbed homes had a shared history with a tragic fire that engulfed a part of Oakville four decades ago, claiming lives and properties.\n20) One fateful stormy night, amidst the crashing thunder and lightning flashes, Sarah had an unsettling encounter in her own warm living room with the very intruder she was seeking.\n21) The masked figure left a hastily scribbled warning note for Sarah, meant to deter her pursuit.\n22) Terrified yet defiant, overcoming the overwhelming fear, Sarah unearthed a newfound courage within herself.\n23) She continued with her investigative pursuits more determined than ever before.\n24) Tracking incidents at various locations across Oakville and connecting the cryptic clues left by the stalker, Sarah was successful in unveiling the man behind the mask \u2013 a woman named Martha Green who was purportedly a victim of the deadly fire.\n25) Undeterred by the grim reality and potential danger, Sarah, impelled by her belief in justice, confronted Martha, face-to-face, unmasking her and her deeds.\n26) Martha confessed to Sarah that she had no intentions to harm.\n27) She was, in fact, targeting these houses as her silent protest for all the injustices she had suffered.\n28) With wisdom and empathy surprising for her age, Sarah convinced Martha to give up her discreet protests and to seek justice in a legal manner.\n29) Martha agreed and vowed to surrender, leaving a wave of anon her decision.\n30) The two then traveled to the police station on a chilly morning, leaving the officers aghast and feeling regretful for soundlessly dismissing Sarah's plea.\n31) Keeping their word to Sarah, the police took Martha into custody while apologizing to the brave teen.\n32) Gradually, the town of Oakville found its way back to the peace and tranquility it was known for.\n33) However, Sarah's reputation had undergone a significant transformation.\n34) The once reticent teenager was now celebrated as a brave detective, and her name was whispered with respect and admiration whenever mentioned.\n35) In a cinematic contrast, Martha, the once-dreaded entity, was seen being driven away in a black and white police vehicle.\n36) The replays of her tear-streaked face in the rearview mirror added a touch of finality to this incredible tale, marking the end of the sinister wave that had shaken the town of Oakville.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to

        "output": "### Task 1\nThe protagonist of the story is Beane \"Bumbling\" Bilgewater.\n\n### Task 2\nThe first turning point is at sentence 2.5, but since sentences are not fractional, I'll consider the introductory event at sentence 4. The sentence is: \n\"Struggling to blend in with the crowd, his poorly sewn costume and misguided sense of diplomacy make him an endearing character.\"\n\nThe protagonist's state here is that he is trying to fit in but is having trouble due to his costume and lack of diplomatic skills. I would approximate his condition as a 2 out of 10.\n\n### Task 3\nThe second turning point is at sentence 5.5, but I'll consider the event at sentence 5. The sentence is:\n\"He has a mission: to steal the Charter and halt the ideological revolution that's stirring in the hearts of the men around him.\"\n\nThe protagonist's state here is that he now has a clear goal and mission, but it's still uncertain if he can succeed. Relative to the first turning point, his condition has improved slightly as he now has a direction. I would approximate his condition as a 4 out of 10.\n\n### Task 4\nThe third turning point is at sentence 11.5, but I'll consider the event at sentence 11. The sentence is:\n\"In the ensuing disorder, the precious Charter is inadvertently trampled by the panicking crowd, becoming a makeshift doormat.\"\n\nThe protagonist's state here is that his plans have caused chaos, and the Charter is being desecrated, but he is still trying to achieve his goal. Relative to the second turning point, his condition has worsened slightly due to the chaos. I would approximate his condition as a 3 out of 10.\n\n### Task 5\nThe fourth turning point is at sentence 16.5, but I'll consider the event at sentence 16. The sentence is not directly related to Bilgewater, so I'll look for a more relevant sentence. Sentence 13 seems more relevant:\n\"Act 2 sees the beloved Charter finally falling into Bilgewater's hands in a slapstick scene replete with a vision-impaired guard, his ill-conceived mouse trap, and the resultant conundrum at hand.\"\n\nHowever, since this is not exactly at the turning point, I'll look at sentence 16 and the surrounding context to find a more suitable event. Sentence 14 seems to start a new sequence of events:\n\"Tasked with retrieving the stolen Charter, our unsuspecting heroes - Simon, a somewhat deranged inventor overly fond of cogs, Francis, a fife player whose music seemed jarringly off-key, and Thomas, a trustworthy scout with a notorious tendency to misplace his all-important compass - prepare for their journey across colonial America.\"\n\nConsidering the events around sentence 16, it seems that the story is now focusing on the heroes trying to retrieve the Charter, and Bilgewater is trying to stop them. The protagonist's state here is that he has achieved his goal of stealing the Charter, but now he faces a new challenge from the heroes. Relative to the third turning point, his condition has improved slightly as he has the Charter. I would approximate his condition as a 6 out of 10.\n\n### Task 6\nThe fifth turning point is at sentence 25. The sentence is:\n\"In their obliviousness, they foil Bilgewater's dastardly plans and finally manage to return the Charter back to its rightful place.\"\n\nThe protagonist's state here is that he has failed to achieve his ultimate goal, and the heroes have foiled his plans. Relative to the fourth turning point, his condition has worsened significantly as he has lost the Charter and failed in his mission. I would approximate his condition as a 1 out of 10.\n\n### Task 7\nThe list of the protagonist's condition at each turning point is:\n2, 4, 3, 6, 1\n\n### Task 8\nBased on the protagonist's condition list, the story arc type is closest to the \"Icarus\" type. The protagonist starts low, rises to a peak, and then falls to a low point. However, the traditional \"Icarus\" arc typically involves a more dramatic rise and fall. The given list also resembles the \"Man in a Hole\" arc, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma and finds a way out, but in this case, the protagonist's ultimate condition is worse than at the beginning. Considering the context and the story's comedic tone, the \"Man in a Hole\" arc seems more fitting, but with a twist. The story can be seen as a comedic \"Man in a Hole\" arc where the protagonist's condition improves temporarily but ultimately worsens.\n\n### Task 9\nMan in a Hole"

Initially, Zoey's condition slightly worsens from the first turning point to the second, then improves at the third turning point. However, she faces another downturn at the fourth turning point before significantly improving by the fifth turning point.

        "output": "### TASK RESPONSE\n\n1. The protagonist in the story is Konga, the monkey who undergoes transformation due to the KTNT experiment.\n\n2. The first turning point (Opportunity, tp1) is at sentence 4.0: \"After a local tribe take the ship's power source, General Mills dispatches famed tracker Skipper Smith and his assistant Marion Kind to retrieve it.\" However, since Konga is not yet introduced, we look at his introductory state which can be considered neutral, around 5.\n\n   Considering Konga's actual introduction in the story: Sentence 11: \"Next he experiments on a monkey, who puts up a fierce fight before taking the KTNT in pill form.\" At this point, Konga's state is neutral, as he is about to undergo an experiment. His condition can be approximated as 5.\n\n3. The second turning point (Change of Plans, tp2) is at sentence 8.0: However, this turning point is not directly related to Konga. For Konga, a more relevant turning point would be after he escapes and starts growing. But to adhere to the format, the state of Konga after sentence 8 can still be considered neutral as he hasn't yet been affected by the events of this turning point, keeping his condition around 5.\n\n   A more relevant sentence for Konga's change would be after he starts growing and gaining power, around sentence 17 or 20. However, sticking strictly to the provided turning points for analysis: At sentence 8, Konga's condition remains unchanged as this event doesn't directly involve him, keeping it at 5.\n\n4. The third turning point (Point of No Return, tp3) is at sentence 12.0: Again, this directly involves Professor Mills and not Konga. However, considering Konga's storyline, after he escapes and starts growing, his condition can be seen as improving due to his newfound power and freedom, approximating his condition to 7.\n\n   Sentence 12: \"As he observes the results, two terrorists break into his facility.\" This event does not directly affect Konga, but considering his growing size and strength around this time in the story, his condition is improving, so we approximate it to 7.\n\n5. The fourth turning point (Major Setback, tp4) is at sentence 20.0: \"The boys play in their backyard with Konga, who suddenly grows to enormous size and rushes past Bummier.\" At this point, Konga's size and lack of control lead to chaos and danger, worsening his condition, approximating it to 3.\n\n6. The fifth turning point (Climax, tp5) is at sentence 27.0: \"Suddenly, Konga returns to his original size, and the boys embrace him.\" At this point, Konga is back to normal, and he receives affection, improving his condition significantly, approximating it to 9.\n\n7. The list of Konga's condition in chronological order is: 5, 5, 7, 3, 9.\n\n8. Based on the protagonist's condition list (5, 5, 7, 3, 9), the story arc type can be classified. Konga starts in a neutral state, rises with his newfound power, faces a significant setback due to his uncontrollable size and the danger it poses, but ultimately ends in a much better condition, loved and back to normal. This pattern of falling into a dilemma and then finding a way out to end better than at the beginning aligns with the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc type.\n\n9. Man in a Hole"

and quantum propulsion technology allows humanity to travel beyond the Solar System.\n3) The Mars colony fails in 2281 and the Alliance controls three colonies: Earth, Zafdie, and Ellora.\n4) In 2519, Zafdie attempts to secede from the Alliance.\n5) During the ensuing war, General James Ford drops a quantum bomb (\"Q-bomb\") on the rebel colony, killing 70 million people.\n6) Ford is subsequently dishonorably discharged from the Alliance military and gains the sobriquet of \"the Blood General.\"\n7) His wife, Doctor Lea Goss, leaves him.\n8) In 2524, miners of the Vander Mining Corp stationed on planet 4217LYA (Heracles System) encounter unseen aliens and Captain Juda Sayle reports an \"FC incident\" to Alliance Command.\n9) On Earth, General Eron Ryle is notified of the incident and orders that Goss and Ford be brought to him.\n10) At a local bar, Dash meets with Ford to discuss a potential job.\n11) A fight between them and civilians is interrupted by Commander Marcus Bleck, who passes on Ryle's request for Ford's counsel.\n12) Ford refuses but subsequently agrees upon the promise of him being reinstated and his military pension restored.\n13) At McMillian Airfield military base, Ford and Dash meet with Goss and Ryle for a situation briefing.\n14) Survivors of the FC incident are brought to the base for quarantine and questioning but quickly turn hostile and begin killing base personnel.\n15) The survivors appear to be infected, do not respond to attempts at communication, appear unfamiliar with human technology (though they quickly learn how to operate  firearms), and \"infect\" several base personnel, who then themselves turn hostile.\n16) The infected humans attempt to board a transport ship but are stopped and eliminated by Ryle, Ford, Dash, and several other soldiers.\n17) While the Alliance Senate debates, Ryle authorizes Operation Cosmic Sin \u2013 with a strike team consisting of himself, Ford, Dash, Goss, Bleck, Specialist Braxton (Ryle's nephew), and technician Corporal Ardene (who is qualified to operate and arm a Q-bomb) \u2013 to launch a retaliatory and decisive counterstrike against the aliens.\n18) Ardene reports that a tachyon pulse was released by one of the infected miners during the base attack, which will allow the aliens to know Earth's location in six or seven hours.\n19) The team is outfitted with small arms, Icarus suits designed for combat and space environments, and a Q-bomb.\n20) The team plans to travel to the Ellora colony via quantum jump, where Alliance forces have shot down an alien ship.\n21) The team intends to recover the downed ship and analyze the cosmic radiation to locate the alien's home planet, then destroy it with the Q-bomb.\n22) The team arrives at incorrect coordinates in orbit of planet Ellora, in the middle of a battle between Alliance and alien spacefleets, and is forced to conduct an  orbital drop through the space debris.\n23) Ryle, Goss, Ford, and Dash go missing during the drop, and the remainder of the team comes under enemy fire almost immediately after landing, with Bleck being critically wounded.\n24) Elloran survivors rescue the team and, after verifying the team is free of alien infection (infected persons cannot talk), the survivors reveal the aliens have invaded the planet and the area is swarming with alien troops and infected humans.\n25) The survivors offer to treat Bleck at their outpost's medbay, and Ardene goes with them.\n26) Meanwhile, Braxton, accompanied by sniper Sol Cantos, proceeds to the downed alien ship.\n27) While analyzing the ship's radiation, Braxton's Icarus suit reports Ford as alive.\n28) He and Sol Cantos recover Ford, who experiences several visions of the aliens and Goss while concussed, and the three reach the Alliance outpost.\n29) At the outpost, Ardene views video log recordings that reveal the aliens are a hive mind that parasitically procreates by infecting victims, who then fall under the control of the hive mind.\n30) Braxton gives the coordinates of the alien's home planet to Ardene, who reports the tachyon interference generated by the aliens means they cannot travel to the coordinates without first getting into orbit.\n31) Meanwhile, Ford consoles then mercy kills the mortally wounded Bleck.\n32) Dash is revealed to have survived and made his way to the outpost.\n33) Ardene discovers the aliens have built a stabilized quantum space gate near Ellora that will allow the alien armada, currently in the Sigea galaxy, to invade the Milky Way in force.\n34) The survivors plan to collapse the gateway with the Q-bomb by firing it via the outpost's orbital cannon.\n35) While prepping the orbital cannon, Ardene receives a signal from Ryle, who has survived in orbit, albeit with his Icarus suit damaged and unfit for  reentry.\n36) He volunteers to position himself on the gateway and trigger his suit's self-destruct to close the gate after the Q-bomb passes through.\n37) The aliens converge on the outpost and speak through an infected Goss, mocking Ford, preaching the superiority of \"the Sigea\", and offering the chance for humankind's assimilation or death.\n38) After Dash replies with a simple \"no,\" the Sigea begin their attack while Goss boards a Sigea ship.\n39) Ford latches onto the ship and later confronts the infected Goss as she prepares to cross via the completed space gate.\n40) With the orbital gun charged, Ardene loads the Q-bomb into a missile and fires it at the gate.\n41) Goss intercepts the Q-bomb missile in a stasis field, blows Ford into space, and crosses to join the assembled Sigea fleet, inadvertently releasing the bomb from the stasis field in the process.\n42) Ryle positions himself on the space gate and, unable to trigger his suit's self-destruct, instead provides a target reference for the orbital gun.\n43) Ardene, with Braxton's reluctant blessing, fires the gun on Ryle's position, killing him and destroying the gate.\n44) The Q-bomb detonates on the other side of the collapsing gateway, the resulting black hole destroying the Sigea's fleet and home star system.\n45) Braxton, stricken with grief over his uncle's death, kills the Sigea's field commander on Ellora.\n46) Back on Earth, seven days after first contact, Braxton, Ardene, Sol Cantos, Dash, and Ford morosely celebrate in a bar as the Alliance Senate proudly declares that the remaining Sigea have unconditionally surrendered.\n47) Ford takes a shot, sadly reminisces about Goss, and then abruptly leaves the bar.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to

        "output": "### TASK RESPONSE\n\n1. **Protagonist Identification:** \nThe protagonist of the story is General James Ford, also known as \"the Blood General.\"\n\n2. **First Turning Point (Opportunity, tp1):** \n Sentence 5: \"During the ensuing war, General James Ford drops a quantum bomb ('Q-bomb') on the rebel colony, killing 70 million people.\"\nAt this point, Ford's state is one of power and responsibility within the military, but this event sets the stage for his subsequent downfall. His condition can be approximated as 6, reflecting his high rank but also the moral and social consequences of his actions.\n\n3. **Second Turning Point (Change of Plans, tp2):** \n Sentence 12: \"Ford refuses but subsequently agrees upon the promise of him being reinstated and his military pension restored.\"\nRelative to the first turning point, Ford's condition has improved slightly as he now sees an opportunity for redemption and restoration of his former status. His condition can be approximated as 7.\n\n4. **Third Turning Point (Point of No Return, tp3):** \n Sentence 18: \"Ardene reports that a tachyon pulse was released by one of the infected miners during the base attack, which will allow the aliens to know Earth's location in six or seven hours.\"\nFord's condition becomes more critical as the stakes are raised, and he must commit to stopping the alien threat. Despite the challenges, his involvement in a crucial mission gives him a sense of purpose. His condition remains around 7.\n\n5. **Fourth Turning Point (Major Setback, tp4):** \n Sentence 33: \"Ardene discovers the aliens have built a stabilized quantum space gate near Ellora that will allow the alien armada, currently in the Sigea galaxy, to invade the Milky Way in force.\"\nFord faces a significant setback as the enemy's capabilities and intentions become clearer, posing a greater threat to humanity. His condition worsens due to the increased danger and difficulty of the mission, approximating 4.\n\n6. **Fifth Turning Point (Climax, tp5):** \n Sentence 44: \"The Q-bomb detonates on the other side of the collapsing gateway, the resulting black hole destroying the Sigea's fleet and home star system.\"\nDespite the victory, Ford's personal condition does not significantly improve due to the losses he has suffered, including the death of his wife and his friend, General Ryle. His condition can be approximated as 5.\n\n7. **Protagonist's Condition List:** \n- 6 (tp1)\n- 7 (tp2)\n- 7 (tp3)\n- 4 (tp4)\n- 5 (tp5)\n\n8. **Story Arc Classification:** \nThe story arc type can be classified based on the protagonist's condition list. The list shows an initial rise, followed by a significant fall, and then a slight recovery but not to the original high point. However, when closely examined, Ford's story can be interpreted as going through two cycles of dilemma and partial recovery, fitting the **Double Man in a Hole** arc type. The initial drop from his military position, the struggle to redeem himself, the major setback during the alien invasion, and the final partial recovery after the climax align with this classification.\n\n9. **Determined Story Arc Type:** \nDouble Man in a Hole"

First turning point (Opportunity)\n Sentence 5: \"As she breaks bread with her mother during a serene dinner, Rebecca discloses her plan to spend her summer break in the coastal village of Seapoint.\"\n\nAt this point, Rebecca is still a reserved and introverted person, unsure about her future plans and struggling to connect with her peers. Her condition can be approximated as a 3 out of 10.\n\n### 3. Second turning point (Change of Plans)\n Sentence 10: \"Intrigued by Seapoint's magnetism, Rebecca begins her exploratory journey, her curious spirit leading her to meet three unique individuals \u2013 Jake, Evelyn, and Emily \u2013 who significantly shape her stay.\"\n\nAt this point, Rebecca has started to open up and explore new experiences, meeting new people who will influence her life. Her condition has improved to a 5 out of 10, as she's starting to break out of her shell.\n\n### 4. Third turning point (Point of No Return)\n Sentence 15: \"Drawing courage from Jake's teachings, Rebecca faces her fear of the sea.\"\n\nHere, Rebecca has made significant progress, facing her fears and embracing new challenges.

Fourth turning point (Major Setback)\n Sentence 22: \"Rebecca\u2019s transformation reaches a seismic level when she boldly confronts a local bully named Alex.\"\n\nAlthough this sentence might seem like a triumph, it's actually a turning point where Rebecca faces a challenge and proves herself. However, considering the context, it's more of a stepping stone for her growth rather than a setback. If I had to choose an alternative sentence for a major setback, I would say there isn't a clear one in the story. Nevertheless, I'll keep the original sentence for the sake of the exercise. Rebecca's condition remains at an 8 out of 10, as she's solidifying her newfound confidence.\n\n### 6. Fifth turning point (Climax)\n Sentence 24: \"Her farewell to her father is an emotional episode marked by silent affirmation of their mutual love and respect.\"\n\nAt this point, Rebecca has undergone a significant transformation, and her relationship with her father has improved dramatically.

Protagonist's condition list\nThe list of Rebecca's condition at each turning point is: [3, 5, 7, 8, 9]\n\n### 8. Classify the story arc type\nBased on the protagonist's condition list, the story arc type can be classified as \"Rags to Riches.\" The list shows a steady improvement in Rebecca's condition from the beginning to the end of the story, with no significant setbacks or declines. This matches the \"Rags to Riches\" story arc type, where the protagonist starts in a disadvantaged situation and ends in a much better one.\n\n### 9. Determined story arc type\nRags to Riches"

Fourth turning point (Major Setback, tp4)\n Sentence 23: \"Tied up in a basement, Fisher is rescued by Maggie and the pair share a kiss and try to escape, finding a crucified Randy and Luke, before Fisher is shot and killed by Sarah and also crucified.\"\nAt this point, Maggie's state has worsened even further. She has lost the person she cares about, and her situation has become even more desperate.\n\nProtagonist's condition: 1\n\n### 6. Fifth turning point (Climax, tp5)\n Sentence 27: \"Maggie, on the other hand, refuses and sees Harold drink from an unpoisoned glass, before hitting him with the wine bottle.\"\nAt this point, Maggie's state has improved slightly. She has taken control of her situation and is fighting back against her father.\n\nProtagonist's condition: 6\n\n### 7. Protagonist's condition list\nThe list of protagonist's conditions is: [4, 5, 2, 1, 6]\n\n### 8. Classify the story arc type\nBased on the protagonist's condition list, the story arc type is Man in a Hole. Maggie's condition worsens significantly as the story progresses, but she eventually finds a way to take control and improve her situation slightly.\n\nHowever, considering the given ground truth of \"Riches to Rags,\" it seems there might be some confusion. Upon re-examining the story, it's clear that Maggie's situation starts off bad and only worsens throughout the story, with a slight improvement at the end. This would suggest that the story arc type is indeed closer to Riches to Rags, but with a slight deviation. If we consider the protagonist's starting point as a \"rich\" state (which is arguable), then the story arc type would be Riches to Rags. However, if we consider the protagonist's starting point as a neutral or \"bad\" state, then the story arc type would be Man in a Hole.\n\n### 9. Determined story arc type\n Riches to Rags"

        "output": "### TASK RESPONSE\n\n1. **Identify the protagonist in the story**: While there are multiple main characters, the story seems to revolve around Sarah and Leah. However, since the narrative follows the group's actions and Sarah's decisions drive the plot forward, we can consider Sarah as the primary protagonist for the majority of the story. The ending, though, shifts the focus to Leah.\n\n2. **First turning point (Opportunity, tp1) at sentence 3**: \n\"The story-telling session swiftly treads onto dangerous waters as the group of friends wade into the chilling mystery of an abandoned, dilapidated cottage at the edge of their small town, Pine Valley, Texas.\"\n**Protagonist's state**: Here, Sarah and her friends are in a state of excitement and anticipation, discussing a thrilling mystery. Their condition can be approximated as a 7, as they are in a comfortable and safe environment but are about to embark on an adventure that carries some risk.\n\n3. **Second turning point (Change of Plans, tp2) at sentence 8**: \n\"A combination of trepidation and reluctant excitement coupled with persuasive words from Sarah finally nudges Beth, Mary, and Leah into accepting the audacious plan.\"\n**Change relative to the first turning point**: At this point, the group has decided to take a significant risk by planning to spend the night in the haunted cottage, indicating a potential for danger. This decision slightly lowers their condition due to the increased risk, making it a 6.\n\n4. **Third turning point (Point of No Return, tp3) at sentence 15**: \n\"Beth is swallowed by the enveloping darkness within the cottage.\"\n**Change relative to the second turning point**: The disappearance of Beth significantly escalates the danger and fear, marking a point of no return for the characters. Their condition drops to a 2, as they are now directly facing the consequences of their decision in a very threatening environment.\n\n5. **Fourth turning point (Major Setback, tp4) at sentence 23**: \n\"The disturbing reports are a testament to a ruthless serial killer who had once made this eerie cottage his home.\"\n**Change relative to the third turning point**: Discovering the dark history of the cottage and understanding the nature of their captor further worsens their situation, increasing their desperation and fear. Their condition can be approximated as a 1, reflecting the heightened danger and hopelessness.\n\n6. **Fifth turning point (Climax, tp5) at sentence 30**: \n\"The narrative takes an unexpected, chilling twist as an alarming apparition materializes in the corners of Leah's room, the spectral figure hinting at a relentless return of the spectral killer.\"\n**Change relative to the fourth turning point**: This twist suggests that even after the sacrifice made by Sarah, Leah is not safe, and the horror may continue. Considering the focus shifts to Leah by the end, her condition remains dire, approximated as a 1, indicating that she is still in a state of extreme vulnerability and fear.\n\n7. **Protagonist's condition list in chronological order**: 7, 6, 2, 1, 1\n\n8. **Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition list and explain your reasoning**: The story arc is best classified as \"Riches to Rags\" because the protagonist starts in a relatively high state of comfort and security (7) but gradually descends into a much worse condition, ending in a state of extreme fear and vulnerability (1). This continuous decline matches the pattern of the \"Riches to Rags\" story arc, where the protagonist's condition worsens significantly from the beginning to the end.\n\n9. **Determined story arc type**: Riches to Rags"

        "output": "### TASK RESPONSE\n\n1. The protagonist in the story is Freddie.\n\n2. At the first turning point (Opportunity, sentence 1): \n\"Twenty-five-year-old Freddie, who was born in South Korea and adopted by French parents, arrives in Seoul 'by accident' after her flight to Tokyo is cancelled.\"\nThe protagonist's state here is neutral and somewhat lost, as she didn't plan to be in Seoul. I would approximate her condition as a 6.\n\n3. The second turning point is at sentence 6 (Change of Plans):\n\"When her father responds, she travels to Gunsan to visit him, with Tena serving as their translator.\"\nRelative to the first turning point, Freddie now has a clear direction and is taking action to meet her biological father, indicating a sense of hope and possibility. Her condition has improved to an 8.\n\n4. The third turning point is at sentence 13 (Point of No Return):\n\"Tena then suddenly appears, but her father ignores Tena's attempt to speak to him and as her father grabs hold of her arm, Freddie screams at him not to touch her and leaves.\"\nRelative to the second turning point, Freddie's encounter with her father has turned sour, leading to a confrontation and a clear break. Her condition has worsened to a 4.\n\n5. The fourth turning point is at sentence 17 (Major Setback):\n\"At a surprise birthday party thrown for her, she reveals to a co-worker who is also an adoptee that her mother has finally responded to several follow-up telegrams to say she is not interested in meeting her.\"\nRelative to the third turning point, Freddie has experienced another significant disappointment, this time from her biological mother, further complicating her emotional state. Her condition has dropped to a 2.\n\n6. The fifth turning point is at sentence 26 (Climax):\n\"Freddie and her mother meet at a Hammond facility and Freddie weeps as her mother embraces her.\"\nRelative to the fourth turning point, there's a surprising reversal as Freddie's mother changes her mind, leading to a moment of healing and connection. However, considering the context and the story's progression, it's clear this high point won't last. Her condition has improved to a 9.\n\n7. The list of protagonist's conditions at each turning point in chronological order is: [6, 8, 4, 2, 9]\n\n8. Classifying the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition list, the pattern shows a rise, followed by a significant fall, then another rise to a high point. However, the story actually ends on a note of ambiguity and potential downturn (with Freddie's mother's email address no longer valid and Freddie's emotional state at the piano), suggesting that the final high point is temporary and that Freddie's condition will likely deteriorate again. This pattern aligns most closely with the Oedipus story arc type, characterized by a rise, fall, recovery, and then another significant downfall.\n\n9. Oedipus"

        "output": "### TASK RESPONSE\n\n1. The protagonist in the story is Kelsa, a transgender high school student.\n\n2. Opportunity (tp1): 6.0 - At this point, the sentence is: \"Kelsa's friend Em admits that she has a crush on Khal and has Kelsa pass him a flirtatious note at lunch.\" \n   The protagonist's state here is relatively neutral, with a sense of friendship and camaraderie with Em and Chris. However, Kelsa also has to navigate the complexities of her friend's crush on Khal, which adds a layer of tension. Approximate condition: 6\n\n3. Change of Plans (tp2): 9.5 - The corresponding sentence is: \"Khal wants to admit his feelings for Kelsa but worries about the social stigma of dating a trans girl, especially from Otis who frequently makes offhand homophobic and transphobic jokes.\" \n   However, since tp2 is 9.5, let's consider the state after this event. Kelsa starts talking to Khal more frequently and becomes closer to him. This is a positive development, but the risk of social stigma and Otis's transphobic jokes creates tension. Approximate condition: 7\n\n4. Point of No Return (tp3): 14.5 - The corresponding sentence is: \"They decide to go for it despite the risk of losing their friends and leave the elevator holding hands in front of all their classmates.\" \n   At this point, Kelsa and Khal have decided to pursue their relationship openly, which is a significant step forward. They are now more committed to each other, but they also face potential backlash from their friends and classmates. Approximate condition: 8\n\n5. Major Setback (tp4): 24.0 - The corresponding sentence is: \"This results in Kelsa being banned from the women's locker rooms and bathrooms.\" \n   Here, Kelsa faces a significant setback due to Em's fabricated story and the subsequent ban. This is a low point for Kelsa, as she is now facing discrimination and marginalization. Approximate condition: 2\n\n6. Climax (tp5): 29.0 - The corresponding sentence is: \"When he returns home from school his parents confront him about his internet history that includes several trans topics, forcing him to admit he is dating a trans woman and leading to a tearful conversation with his mother about the stigma that has come with dating Kelsa.\" \n   Although this sentence is about Khal, it indirectly affects Kelsa's state. However, a more relevant sentence would be: \"Khal shares a link to one of Kelsa's YouTube videos on Reddit and it goes viral, resulting in her mom finding the channel and forcing her to take it down out of concerns for her safety.\" \n   However, considering the events after tp5, including the reconciliation between Kelsa and Khal, and Kelsa's mom, we can say Kelsa's condition has improved. Approximate condition: 9\n\n7. The list of protagonist's condition in chronological order is: [6, 7, 8, 2, 9]\n\n8. Based on the protagonist's condition list, the story arc type can be classified as Oedipus. The reasoning behind this classification is that the protagonist starts at a relatively neutral state (6), rises to a higher state (7 and 8) as she develops a relationship with Khal, faces a significant setback (2) due to Em's actions, but ultimately recovers and achieves a higher state (9) after reconciling with Khal and her mom.\n\n9.

Based on the protagonist's condition list, the story arc type can be classified as \"Man in a Hole\". This is because the protagonists' condition worsens from the first turning point to the fourth turning point, but then improves significantly at the fifth turning point, ending better than at the beginning. This pattern matches the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc type, where the protagonist falls into a dilemma and finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning.\n\n9. Man in a Hole"

        "output": "### TASK SOLUTION\n\n1. **Protagonist Identification:** The protagonist in the story is Jane Doe.\n\n2. **First Turning Point (Opportunity, tp1):** \n   Sentence 4: \"Jane observes an anomaly\u2014a worn-out leather-bound diary, skilfully camouflaged among the beach pebbles.\"\n   At this point, Jane's state is one of curiosity and interest, but she hasn't yet been significantly impacted by the diary's contents. Her condition can be approximated as a 6, representing a neutral state with a hint of curiosity.\n\n3. **Second Turning Point (Change of Plans, tp2):** \n   Sentence 9: \"Armed with her journalistic persistence, Jane feels a compelling urge to uncover the chapters of Thomas's life that went beyond the worn pages of the diary.\"\n   Here, Jane's state changes to one of determination and engagement. She has become invested in uncovering more about Thomas's life, indicating a rise in her emotional involvement and purpose. Her condition improves to an 8, reflecting her increased motivation and interest.\n\n4. **Third Turning Point (Point of No Return, tp3):** \n   Sentence 11: \"She reaches out to everyone who might have crossed paths with Thomas or might have heard his story.\"\n   At this point, Jane's state is characterized by her active pursuit of information about Thomas. Her actions demonstrate a deeper commitment to the story, suggesting a slight improvement in her condition due to the sense of purpose and direction. Her condition can be approximated as a 9.\n\n5. **Fourth Turning Point (Major Setback, tp4):** \n   Sentence 14: \"Their collective narratives paint a vicarious, terrifyingly graphic tale.\"\n   Although this turning point is identified as a major setback, in the context of Jane's journey, it represents a significant emotional and psychological impact rather than a traditional setback. Her state here is complex, involving a deeper emotional engagement with the story and its characters, which can be challenging but ultimately contributes to her growth and the story's progression. Given the complexity, her condition might be perceived as dropping to a 7 due to the emotional toll, but it's essential to recognize that this \"setback\" also signifies a crucial step in her journey.\n\n6. **Fifth Turning Point (Climax, tp5):** \n   Sentence 19: \"Clutching the printed column, Jane and Robert pay their respects at Thomas's memorial located within the secluded Commonwealth War Graves.\"\n   At the climax, Jane's state is one of accomplishment, respect, and closure. She has successfully uncovered and shared Thomas's story, and in doing so, has found a sense of purpose and fulfillment. Her condition improves to a 10, representing the highest point of her journey.\n\n7. **Protagonist's Condition List:** [6, 8, 9, 7, 10]\n\n8. **Story Arc Classification:** Based on the protagonist's condition list, the story arc type can be classified as \"Man in a Hole.\" The reasoning behind this classification is that Jane starts at a neutral state (6), then her condition improves as she becomes more engaged and motivated (8, 9), followed by a slight drop due to the emotional impact of the narratives (7), and finally reaches a high point upon achieving her goal and finding fulfillment (10). This pattern closely resembles the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist's condition generally improves from the beginning to the end, despite experiencing a temporary drop.\n\n9. **Determined Story Arc Type:** Man in a Hole"

        "output": "### TASK RESPONSE\n\n1. **Protagonist Identification:** The protagonist of the story is Annie Hardy.\n\n2. **First Turning Point (Opportunity, tp1):** Sentence 6 is the first turning point: \"Overhearing Gemma urging Stretch to kick her out, Annie steals Stretch\u2019s car and phone and takes a delivery job for him.\" At this point, Annie's state is precarious as she's just had a conflict with Gemma and is now taking a risk by stealing Stretch's car. Her condition can be approximated as a 4 out of 10 because she's taking control of her situation but also inviting more trouble.\n\n3. **Second Turning Point (Change of Plans, tp2):** Sentence 9 is the second turning point: \"A woman enters, looking for Angela, and attacks Annie, who flees the diner with Angela.\" Relative to the first turning point, Annie's situation has escalated into physical danger, making her condition worse. This can be approximated as a 2 out of 10 because she's now in immediate danger.\n\n4. **Third Turning Point (Point of No Return, tp3):** Sentence 16 is the third turning point: \"The driver is the woman from the diner, who reveals she is Angela\u2019s mother, revealing that Angela is actually sixteen and shows a photo of her with the same tattoo.\" This revelation deepens the mystery and danger Annie is in, but she also gains more understanding of the situation, which could be seen as a slight improvement in her condition relative to the second turning point. However, considering the increased danger, her condition might still be approximated as a 3 out of 10, as the situation is more complex and dangerous.\n\n5. **Fourth Turning Point (Major Setback, tp4):** Sentence 21 is the fourth turning point: \"There, Angela kills Stretch.\" This is a significant setback for Annie as she loses a friend and ally, making her condition worse than at the third turning point. This can be approximated as a 1 out of 10 because she's lost support and is in greater danger.\n\n6. **Fifth Turning Point (Climax, tp5):** Sentence 26 is the fifth turning point: \"Angela attacks Annie, but Annie kills her with a knife.\" Relative to the fourth turning point, Annie's condition significantly improves as she overcomes her main antagonist, though she's still in a dangerous and traumatic situation. This can be approximated as a 6 out of 10 because she's achieved a major victory but at great cost.\n\n7. **Protagonist's Condition List:** Based on the analysis, the list of Annie's condition at each turning point is [4, 2, 3, 1, 6].\n\n8. **Story Arc Classification Reasoning:** Given the protagonist's condition list [4, 2, 3, 1, 6], the story can be classified as \"Man in a Hole\" because Annie's condition initially worsens as she faces more danger and complications, hits a low point with the loss of Stretch, and then improves as she overcomes her main antagonist, ending in a better state than at the beginning of the story arc.\n\n9. **Determined Story Arc Type:** Man in a Hole"

The sentence is:\n    \"Clad in his military uniform, Colin is cinematically shown strapped to a beautifully designed parachute, clasping an antique diamond engagement ring in his right hand - a symbol of commitment he desires to present to Anna.\"\n    At this point, Anna is unaware of the events unfolding above her and is diligently working on the flower arrangement. Her state is one of normalcy and focus on her job. I would rate her condition as an 8.\n\n3. The second turning point is Change of Plans (tp2) at sentence 11. The sentence is:\n    \"Anna's grand air entrance ends with a dramatic plunge into a picturesque lily pond adjacent to the ceremony.\"\n    At this point, Anna's life is disrupted by the unexpected fall from the plane, and she finds herself in the middle of a chaotic situation.

At the sentence indicated by the first turning point (Opportunity, sentence 2), the sentence is: \"She chooses Detroit, Michigan as the canvas of her new life, signing a lease for an old Victorian house.\" \n   - At this point, Jane is starting a new life in a different city, which indicates a sense of uncertainty and risk. She's leaving behind the comfort of her hometown, which might make her feel a bit vulnerable. Her condition can be approximated as a 2.\n\n3. The second turning point is Change of Plans (sentence 16): \"This spark of jubilation motivates her next journey - the revival of her decrepit Victorian abode.\"\n   - Here, Jane has secured a job at Cargill Corporation, which is a significant achievement. This newfound success has boosted her confidence, and she's now motivated to take on a new project - renovating her house. Her condition has improved relative to the first turning point, and it can be approximated as a 6.\n\n4. The third turning point is Point of No Return (sentence 25): \"Continuing her probe into her home's thrilling storyline without faltering in her demanding role at Cargill, she skillfully strikes a balance, earning admiration from her colleagues and strengthening alliances in the Detroit community.\"\n   - At this point, Jane is successfully balancing her job and her investigation into the mysterious happenings in her house. She's earning admiration from her colleagues and building a strong reputation in the community. Her condition has improved further, and it can be approximated as an 8.\n\n5. The fourth turning point is Major Setback (sentence 30): \"Jane's deepening involvement with the clandestine society elicits threats from shadowy figures, testing her ironclad will and resilience.\"\n   - Here, Jane is facing a significant setback - she's receiving threats from unknown figures, which puts her safety at risk. This is a challenging situation for her, and her condition has worsened relative to the third turning point. Her condition can be approximated as a 4.\n\n6. The fifth turning point is Climax (sentence 33): \"In a combined effort with her Cargill colleagues and supportive neighborhood in Detroit, a secret sting operation is launched.\"\n   - At this point, Jane is taking action against the clandestine society, and she's not alone - she has the support of her colleagues and the community. This is a bold move, and it shows that she's determined to bring the truth to light. Her condition has improved significantly, and it can be approximated as a 10.\n\n7. The list of protagonist's condition in chronological order is: [2, 6, 8, 4, 10]\n\n8. Based on the protagonist's condition list, the story arc type can be classified as \"Cinderella\". The list shows that Jane starts in a relatively low state (2), rises to a better state (6), then to an even better state (8), faces a setback (4), but ultimately achieves a high state (10). This pattern matches the Cinderella story arc type, where the protagonist rises, faces a setback, and ultimately achieves a higher state.\n\n9. Cinderella"

The first turning point (Opportunity) is sentence 2: \"Working as an exotic dancer, she is offered a lucrative job by customer Pete Brenner.\" At this point, Liza's state is one of struggling to make ends meet as a single mother, working as an exotic dancer. However, she is offered a potentially life-changing job opportunity. Her condition at this point can be approximated as a 2, considering her difficult situation but also the new opportunity.\n\n3. The second turning point (Change of Plans) is sentence 8: \"Pete gives her five days to convince a physician to prescribe their drug, Lonafen.\" Relative to the first turning point, Liza now has a clear goal and a challenge to overcome, which gives her a sense of direction and motivation. Her condition at this point can be approximated as a 4, as she has a clearer path forward but still faces significant challenges.\n\n4. The third turning point (Point of No Return) is sentence 27: \"When a friend's husband dies from a Lonafen overdose and her condolences are rejected, Liza agrees to testify to the U.S. Attorney's office that's investigating Zanna.\" Relative to the second turning point, Liza has now become deeply embroiled in the company's wrongdoings and has decided to take a stand against them, which marks a significant turning point in her moral journey. Her condition at this point can be approximated as a 6, as she is taking a courageous step but also faces potential consequences.\n\n5. The fourth turning point (Major Setback) is sentence 26: \"After Lydell is arrested in a DEA sting, a desperate Liza asks Neel for help paying for the surgery but he exhorts her to use Phoebe's situation as 'fire' for inspiration, like he did when his wife was dying from cancer and he came up with Lonafen.\" Relative to the third turning point, this sentence actually occurs before it in the story, but in terms of the protagonist's condition, it represents a major setback as she faces a significant personal crisis with her daughter's health and is rebuffed by her employer. Her condition at this point can be approximated as a 3, as she is facing a severe challenge and feels helpless.\n\n6. The fifth turning point (Climax) is sentence 32: \"Neel himself remains seemingly untouchable until Liza links him to Zanna's illegal activities via an old email exchange during his affair with her mother.\" Relative to the fourth turning point, Liza has now found a way to bring down the corrupt CEO and clean up the company's wrongdoing, which marks a significant triumph for her. However, considering the overall context of the story, including her sentencing and the consequences of her actions, her condition at this point can be approximated as a 1, as she has achieved a moral victory but at great personal cost.\n\n7. The list of protagonist's conditions in chronological order is: 2, 4, 6, 3, 1.\n\n8. Based on the protagonist's condition list, the story arc type can be classified as Icarus. The reasoning is that Liza starts in a low condition (2), rises to a higher state (4 and 6) as she becomes more successful in her job and takes a stand against the company's wrongdoings, but then faces a drastic downfall (3 and 1) as she confronts the consequences of her actions and the company's corruption.\n\n9.

At the sentence indicated by the first turning point (Opportunity, 8.0), the sentence is:\n\"Steadily, Sara finds herself embroiled in the rigorous demands placed by her role as the art director at a premier advertising agency.\"\nAt this turning point, Sara's state is one of challenge and adjustment to her new role, but also an opportunity for growth and success. Max, on the other hand, is finding solace in the city and establishing connections. Their overall condition can be approximated as a 6, as they are facing new challenges but also experiencing some successes.\n\n3. The second turning point (Change of Plans, 12.0) is:\n\"Tricks of fate soon follow when the couple's renovated townhouse fiendishly springs a leak from the third-floor bathroom and plunges the house into darkness with unexpected power outages, adding further hurdles into Sara's life.\"\nAt this turning point, Sara and Max's condition has worsened relative to the first turning point. They are facing unexpected problems with their home, which is adding to their stress and challenges. Their condition can be approximated as a 4.\n\n4. The third turning point (Point of No Return, 17.0) is:\n\"Over heartwarming scenes of cuddling during blackouts, giggles over soggy breakfasts, and Sunday art sessions, they decide to defy the odds.\"\nAt this turning point, Sara and Max's condition has improved relative to the second turning point. They have decided to take action and fight against the challenges they are facing, and they are finding strength and comfort in each other. Their condition can be approximated as a 7.\n\n5. The fourth turning point (Major Setback, 18.0) is:\n\"The couple devises a clever stratagem with the neighborhood children at their disposal, combining play and cunning to fight Randolph and ward off potential buyers.\"\nAt this turning point, Sara and Max's condition has not changed significantly relative to the third turning point. They are still facing challenges, but they are also taking action and finding creative solutions. However, their condition could be approximated as a 6, as they are still in the midst of a difficult situation.\n\n6. The fifth turning point (Climax, 23.0) is:\n\"The final act reveals our heroes - Sara, Max, and their band of misfits, staging a triumphant showdown with Randolph's representatives.\"\nAt this turning point, Sara and Max's condition has improved significantly relative to the fourth turning point.

The list of protagonist conditions in chronological order is: [6, 4, 7, 6, 9].\n\n8. Based on the protagonist's condition list, the story arc type can be classified as \"Man in a Hole\". This is because the protagonist's condition starts at a moderate level, then falls to a lower point, but ultimately rises to a higher point than at the beginning. The story follows a pattern of challenge, setback, and ultimate triumph, which is characteristic of the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc type.\n\n9. Man in a Hole"

        "output": "### TASK SOLUTION\n\n1. **Protagonist Identification:** \nThe protagonist of this story is Rose DeWitt Bukater.\n\n2. **First Turning Point (Opportunity, tp1):** \n Sentence 4: \"[Note 1] Rose Dawson Calvert, claiming to be the person in the drawing, visits Lovett and tells of her experiences aboard Titanic.\"\n At this point, Rose's state is one of reflection, as she recounts her experiences on the Titanic to Lovett. However, considering the overall context of her story, we can infer that at the beginning (1912), Rose was high in social status but felt trapped in her arranged engagement. Her condition can be approximated as an 8, considering her high social status but personal unhappiness.\n\n3. **Second Turning Point (Change of Plans, tp2):** \n Sentence 7: \"Distraught over the engagement, Rose considers committing suicide by jumping from the stern; Jack Dawson, a penniless artist, convinces her not to.\"\n At this point, Rose is at a low emotional state due to her engagement but is saved by Jack, which introduces a potential for change and hope in her life. Her condition can be approximated as a 3, considering her emotional distress and the beginning of her questioning her current life path.\n\n4. **Third Turning Point (Point of No Return, tp3) and Fourth Turning Point (Major Setback, tp4):** \n Sentence 19: \"When Jack and Rose attempt to tell Cal of the collision, Cal has his manservant slip the necklace into Jack's pocket and accuses him of theft.\"\n At this point, Rose's situation becomes complicated as Jack is accused of theft and her feelings for him are put to the test against the backdrop of the ship's impending doom. This marks both the point of no return and a major setback, as their love is challenged and the ship's disaster intensifies their situation. Her condition can be approximated as a 4, considering the complications and the danger they are in.\n\n5. **Fifth Turning Point (Climax, tp5):** \n Sentence 33: \"Jack and Rose ride the stern into the ocean and he helps her onto a wooden panel only buoyant enough for one person.\"\n At this point, Rose faces the ultimate tragedy as Jack dies, but she finds the strength to survive. Her condition can be approximated as a 2, considering the immense emotional loss but her determination to live.\n\n6. **Protagonist's Condition List:** \n - Opportunity (tp1): 8\n - Change of Plans (tp2): 3\n - Point of No Return (tp3) / Major Setback (tp4): 4\n - Climax (tp5): 2\n\n7. **Story Arc Classification:** \nGiven the protagonist's condition list (8, 3, 4, 4, 2), we can see that Rose starts from a relatively high position (8), falls into despair and questioning (3), slightly recovers with hope and complications (4), and then faces a significant emotional downfall with the loss of Jack (2). This pattern aligns most closely with the **Oedipus** story arc type, where the protagonist starts high, falls, recovers, and then faces another significant downfall. However, given the classification provided in the task (Riches to Rags), it seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the interpretation. The Riches to Rags arc typically involves a consistent decline from a high status to a lower one without significant recovery in between. Upon reevaluation, while Rose's story does involve a decline from wealth and social status to a life of her own choosing (but significantly less luxurious), the emotional highs and lows, particularly the love and loss of Jack, play a crucial role in her story, complicating a straightforward Riches to Rags interpretation. Yet, considering the task's instruction, the focus seems to be on the overall decline from her initial wealth and status to her final condition, supporting the Riches to Rags classification despite the complexities.\n\n8. **Determined Story Arc Type:** \nRiches to Rags"

His condition can be approximated as a 6, as he is still struggling but showing signs of potential success.\n\n**Task 3: Describe the protagonist's state at the second turning point (Change of Plans, tp2: 6.5)**\n\n Sentence 7: \"Observing Carlos and Bandit, De La Vega plots a nefarious scheme to separate the pair and profit from Bandit's rhythmic gift.\"\n\nAt this point, Carlos is unaware of the danger lurking ahead, but De La Vega's plan poses a significant threat to Carlos' budding success. Carlos' condition can be approximated as a 5, as his progress is about to be disrupted by De La Vega's scheme.\n\n**Task 4: Describe the protagonist's state at the third turning point (Point of No Return, tp3: 9.5)**\n\n Sentence 9: \"Blinded by falsified promises of international fame and fortune, Carlos, oblivious to the deception at play, signs the contract.\"\n\nAt this point, Carlos has made a critical mistake by signing the contract, which will lead to his separation from Bandit and further trouble.

This is because Carlos' condition starts at a moderate level (6), then declines due to De La Vega's scheme (5) and his own mistake (2), but eventually recovers as he takes action to rescue Bandit (4) and ultimately achieves success (9). This narrative pattern, where the protagonist faces a significant setback but ultimately recovers and achieves a better state, is characteristic of the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc.\n\n**Task 9: State the determined story arc type**\n\nMan in a Hole"

        "output": "Let's break down the story and analyze the protagonist's condition at each turning point.\n\n### Task 1: Identify the protagonist\nThe protagonist of the story is Auden West, an 18-year-old recent high school graduate.\n\n### Task 2: Describe the protagonist's state at the first turning point (Opportunity, sentence 3)\n Sentence 3: \"An absentee dad for years, locking himself away in his office to work on his studies, he has an infant and is remarried to Heidi. Upon Heidi's suggestion, Auden goes to the Tip on her first day.\"\n\nAt this point, Auden is in a new environment, trying to spend a carefree summer with her father, but she's also dealing with her parents' complicated past and her own uncertain future. Her condition is around 4, as she's trying to navigate her new surroundings and family dynamics.\n\n### Task 3: Describe the protagonist's state at the second turning point (Change of Plans, sentence 9)\n Sentence 9: \"Ten days after her arrival she meets fellow insomniac Eli.\"\n\nAt this point, Auden meets Eli, who will become a significant influence on her life. She starts to open up and explore new experiences, which improves her condition to around 6. She's starting to feel more comfortable in her new environment and is developing a connection with someone who understands her.\n\n### Task 4: Describe the protagonist's state at the third turning point (Point of No Return, sentence 20)\n Sentence 20: \"Later, talking in Eli's truck, he pushes the idea of learning to ride a bike again, and she tries to bring up his BMXing, but neither want to talk about it.\"\n\nAt this point, Auden is becoming more confident and willing to take risks. She's developing a deeper connection with Eli and is starting to confront her fears and insecurities. Her condition improves to around 7, as she's becoming more self-assured and open to new experiences.\n\n### Task 5: Describe the protagonist's state at the fourth turning point (Major Setback, sentence 32)\n Sentence 32: \"Auden and Eli have a temporary falling out over biking, she because she won't admit she never learned and he because he's mostly abandoned BMXing because of Abe's death.\"\n\nAt this point, Auden faces a setback in her relationship with Eli, and her own insecurities and fears resurface.

She's learned to confront her fears, develop deeper connections with others, and find her own sense of purpose and happiness. Her condition improves to around 9, as she's achieved a higher level of self-awareness, confidence, and fulfillment.\n\n### Task 7: List the protagonist's condition at each turning point\nThe list of protagonist's condition at each turning point is: [4, 6, 7, 5, 9]\n\n### Task 8: Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition list\nBased on the list, we can see that the protagonist's condition generally improves throughout the story, with some setbacks and challenges along the way. The story arc type that best fits this pattern is the \"Rags to Riches\" arc, where the protagonist starts in a relatively low state and ends in a significantly better one.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, we can also see that the protagonist's condition follows a more nuanced pattern, with a significant improvement in the third turning point, followed by a setback in the fourth turning point, and finally a major improvement in the fifth turning point. This pattern is more consistent with the \"Cinderella\" arc, where the protagonist rises, faces a setback, and ultimately achieves a higher state.\n\nGiven the complexity of the story and the protagonist's journey, I would argue that the story arc type is more accurately classified as \"Cinderella\" rather than \"Rags to Riches\".\n\n### Task 9: State the determined story arc type\nCinderella"

tour and music.\n2) While the rest of the band have no recollection of the actual rescue, Nathan is suffering from post-traumatic stress from the experience and Magnus Hammersmith's suicide, while Toki has emotionally regressed to a child-like state as a coping mechanism.\n3) This results in him passing out during their first performance back together and all plans being indefinitely paused while he recovers at Mordhaus.\n4) During a memorial service for Ishnifus Meaddle, Charles Offdensen (now leader of the Church of the Black Klok) tasks Nathan with writing the \"Song of Salvation\" to prevent the Doomstar from destroying the Earth and allowing Mr Salacia to become whole again, but Nathan declines, choosing to settle down with Abigail.\n5) However, Abigail declines his proposal.\n6) After a confrontation with fans who witnessed it, Nathan ultimately decides to focus on his music, and the band head to a secret location under the guidance of Dick Knubbler.\n7) Meanwhile, General Crozier has been temporarily freed from control by Mr Salacia while he attempts to possess another, as he can only possess one person at a time.\n8) Now aware of what the Tribunal's true motives are, Crozier attempts to get a message out, but is stopped by Vater Orlaag before Salacia regains control.\n9) It turns out that the other person Salacia is attempting to possess is William Murderface, who experiences disturbing and painful hallucinations as Salacia takes control and influences him to damage Nathan's confidence and prevent the Song of Salvation from being written, as well as revealing the location of the Army of the Doomstar.\n10) At the end of their training and a drug induced meeting between Nathan and the Whale Prophet, the band begin performing the Song of Salvation.\n11) However, as they begin, Nathan realises that this is the wrong song.\n12) During their performance of \"Aortic Desecration\", the Doomstar approaches Earth and begins the Metalocalypse, destroying monuments across the planet and killing millions.\n13) The US Army and the Tribunal's own militia then attack the band's location, wiping out the Army of the Doomstar and killing Knubbler.\n14) During the attack, Crozier is able to free himself of Salacia's control for good while Murderface flees, still possessed and blaming himself for sabotaging the band's attempt to save the world.\n15) Crozier offers his help to the band as Skwisgaar, still in shock from the attack, is able to reveal Murderface's possession to the others.\n16) Crozier tells the band how to free him from Salacia and the band forgive him for what happened, given that he was not in control of his actions, explaining that he belongs in the band as he brings balance to the group with his negativity.\n17) Realising what they now need to do, Dethklok and Crozier reconvene with Edgar Jomfru to perform the correct Song of Salvation, \"SOS\", but during their performance, Vater Orlaag orders an attack on the group.\n18) Dethklok are captured by Salacia and, after Nathan refuses Salacia's offer to join him, the five are hooked up to the supercomputer Salacia built to draw in the Doomstar.\n19) This allows Salacia to draw on the power of the Doomstar and commence the \"Great Reuniting\", becoming whole once more, but Nathan is able to break free of his restraints and break the computer long enough for the rest of the band to break free.\n20) Jomfru and Crozier infiltrate the facility, with Jomfru planting a bomb to destroy the supercomputer while Crozier attempts to regain control of the US military.\n21) Jomfru is killed, but not before successfully activating the bomb.\n22) The band are joined by Offdensen, the Church of the Black Klok, and their legions of fans, and fight the Tribunal's forces and the US Army while Vater Orlaag fights Offdensen.\n23) Just as Orlaag is about to kill Offdensen, he is distracted by Murderface, allowing Offdensen to recover and kill Orlaag.\n24) Crozier manages to regain control of the US military and orders them to stand down and assist the fans, apprehending the Tribunal's forces.\n25) However, Salacia emerges from his coccoon in his true form, killing many of the people on the battlefield.\n26) As he attempts to kill Dethklok, Nathan draws on the power of the Doomstar himself to counter Salacia's attacks.\n27) The band's power spreads to the legions of fans, amplifying their power and forcing Salacia to \"Go into the Water\", where he is finally killed by the Whale Prophet.\n28) Addressing their fans in the aftermath, Nathan realises that the fans are the true Army of the Doomstar, and that their new relationship with their fans is the true \"Great Reuniting\".\n29) The group and fans celebrate as the movie ends.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to

Instead, the story arc type is \"Riches to Rags\" does not fit, since Randall Lock does not start in a high-status position. A better fit is the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc type does not fit, since Randall Lock does not end in a better state than at the beginning.

support of their newest product, Klaralon.\n3) The drug is being touted as the first non-addictive painkiller and is due to be released shortly as a replacement for Oxycodone.\n4) The study uncovers concerning results; Klaralon initially presents as non-addictive when taken daily for the first 7 days (parameters specified by Northlight), however after 7 days it becomes almost three times more addictive than Oxycodone.\n5) Realising the public health implications, Brower recommends to Northlight they delay Klaralon's release for further testing, which they object to.\n6) Board member Dr. Bill Simons tries to tempt Brower into changing his mind by offering a large research grant, but Brower refuses.\n7) With Northlight being one of the university's main donors, Brower finds himself under pressure from department head Greg Talbot to approve the study, but again is reluctant.\n8) Northlight begins leaking information to discredit his reputation, and Everett University revokes his tenure.\n9) Desperate, Brower becomes a whistleblower and contacts the FDA, being put in contact with investigator Ben Walker.\n10) Detroit based DEA agent Jake Kelly has managed to infiltrate two

later found dead as a result of a fentanyl overdose, shocking Claire who is convinced he never took drugs.\n20) Although the Detroit Police Department treats it as an accidental death, she hires a private investigator who determines David was forced to take the fentanyl and was murdered.\n21) Through her son's social media she tracks down one of his friends, who confesses several teenagers from the hockey team (from both Detroit and Montreal) work for Mother as drug runners, although David had only done it once.\n22) Reimann crosses the Ambassador Bridge and travels to Montreal where she hires another private investigator, who provides her with information on Mother and a privately made firearm.\n23) She threatens another drug runner, Derrick Millebran, who believes that Mother is killing them to tie up loose ends after Cedric's arrest.\n24) Kelly becomes aware of Reimann's activities through investigation of Cedric's associates, and intercepts her outside La Marina.\n25) He

fled to Algeria.\n29) Given the seizure of the drugs at the meet, both US and Canadian agencies decide to disband the continued search for Mother and the Armenians.\n30) Outraged, Kelly goes against

        "output": "### Task 1: Identify the protagonist in the story\nThe protagonist in the story is Audrey Sullivan.\n\n### Task 2: Describe the protagonist's state at the first turning point (Opportunity, tp1: 6.0)\n Sentence 6: \"Chao says that in order for him to do business with Audrey, he must know about her birth family, whom she has never met.\"\nAt this point, Audrey is introduced to an opportunity that could lead to her promotion to partner at her law firm. However, this opportunity also brings up a sensitive topic, her unknown birth family. I would approximate Audrey's condition at this point as a 6 out of 10. She is a successful lawyer but faces a challenge that could impact her career advancement.\n\n### Task 3: Describe the protagonist's state at the second turning point (Change of Plans, tp2: 10.0)\n Sentence 10: \"The quartet board a train to Audrey's adoption agency, where they sit next to a drug dealer.\"\nAt this point, Audrey decides to take a risk and embark on a journey to find her birth family in order to secure the deal with Chao. This decision marks a change in her plans and sets her on a path of self-discovery. I would approximate Audrey's condition at this point as a 7 out of 10.

This revelation marks a point of no return for Audrey, as she can no longer go back to her previous life without confronting the truth about her past. I would approximate Audrey's condition at this point as a 3 out of 10. She is facing a major identity crisis and is uncertain about her future.\n\n### Task 5: Describe the protagonist's state at the fourth turning point (Major Setback, tp4: 17.0)\n Sentence 17: \"Lolo livestreams their idol performance of \"WAP\" on Instagram Live, only for Kat's skirt to accidentally fall off, revealing a large devil tattoo on her vulva.\"\nAt this point, Audrey and her friends face a major setback when their attempt to secure a private jet to Seoul fails, and they are forced to flee. This event marks a low point in Audrey's journey, as she is forced to confront the consequences of her actions. I would approximate Audrey's condition at this point as a 2 out of 10. She is facing a major failure and is uncertain about her future.\n\n### Task 6: Describe the protagonist's state at the fifth turning point (Climax, tp5: 20.0)\n Sentence 20: \"Chao calls Audrey to inform her that the deal is off; Audrey then is fired from her job, while Kat is at risk of losing her television deal.\"\nAt this point, Audrey faces the consequences of her actions, and her world falls apart. She loses her job, and her friends are impacted by the fallout. I would approximate Audrey's condition at this point as a 1 out of 10. She is at her lowest point, having lost everything she had worked for.\n\n### Task 7: List the protagonist's condition at each turning point\n Audrey's condition at each turning point: [6, 7, 3, 2, 1]\n\n### Task 8: Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition list\nBased on the protagonist's condition list, I would classify the story arc type as \"Man in a Hole.\" The story follows Audrey as she falls into a dilemma (discovering her birth family's secrets and facing a major identity crisis) and then finds a way out (coming to terms with her past and starting a new life). The protagonist's condition improves from the lowest point (1 out of 10) to a more positive outcome (implied by the final sentence, where Audrey has started her own law firm and is on a best-friends trip in Paris).\n\n### Task 9: State the determined story arc type\nMan in a Hole"

in turn, Shirley tolerates Stanley's posturing and pomposity, and she winks at his serial love affairs.\n8) The Nemsers move into the Jackson-Hyman house.\n9) Shirley is deliberately dismissive of and even cruel to Rose, who has apparently given up on her studies in order to manage the household.\n10) Shirley begins to write again, announcing a new work based on Paula Jean Welden, a young woman who recently disappeared from Bennington's campus.\n11) Stanley is obsessive and controlling about Shirley's writing process;

The sentence corresponding to the third turning point (Point of No Return, tp3) is not explicitly stated, but it is described as occurring around sentence 15: \n\"She is enraptured by and protective of Shirley.\"\nAt this point, Rose has become deeply emotionally invested in Shirley and is prioritizing her relationship with Shirley over her own needs and desires.

The sentence corresponding to the fourth turning point (Major Setback, tp4) is: \n\"When Shirley arrives, Rose hands her the baby and then follows the trail into the woods.\"\nAt this point, Rose has reached a crisis point and is considering abandoning her life and responsibilities.

        "output": "### TASK COMPLETION\n\n1. The protagonist in the story is Jack Mancini.\n\n2. The first turning point (Opportunity, tp1) is at sentence 3. The sentence is: \"Their course of action lays severe - they plan to upend the tranquillity of Stuart Hawke, a successful business magnate known for his sprawling real estate holding.\" At this point, Jack's state is one of desperation and a desire to escape his tumultuous past. His condition can be approximated as a 2 out of 10, as he is still entrenched in his life of crime.\n\n3. The second turning point (Change of Plans, tp2) is at sentence 11. However, 11 is given in the prompt as a decimal number, 11.0, indicating the section of the story it belongs to rather than the exact sentence. The actual sentence is 12: \"As they skin deep into the complex layers of their mission, Jack finds himself drawn towards Alison, Hawke's vibrant daughter, radiant with her benevolent spirit and enviable courage.\" At this point, Jack's state has changed as he begins to experience unexpected emotions and a glimmer of hope for a better life. His condition can be approximated as a 4 out of 10, as he is still committed to the crime but is starting to see a way out.\n\n4. The third turning point (Point of No Return, tp3) is at sentence 18. The sentence is: \"This unexpected act of valour raises red flags for Frank and Eddie, instilling doubts about Jack's loyalty.\" At this point, Jack's state has changed significantly as he has now prioritized Alison's safety over the objectives of his allies, indicating a shift in his loyalties and values. His condition can be approximated as a 6 out of 10, as he is taking steps towards redemption but is also in a precarious situation.\n\n5. The fourth turning point (Major Setback, tp4) is at sentence 25. The sentence is: \"Diverting the incoming catastrophe, he feeds ineffectual information to his co-conspirators, while covertly working towards safeguarding Alison and her family.\" At this point, Jack's state has changed as he is now actively working against his former allies and facing the consequences of his betrayal. His condition can be approximated as a 3 out of 10, as he is in a difficult and dangerous situation.\n\n6. The fifth turning point (Climax, tp5) is indicated at 37.0, meaning it's in that section of the story rather than the exact sentence. The actual climax occurs around sentences 32-35. For the purpose of this analysis, we'll consider the climax to be sentence 35: \"As Jack is carted away by the domineering police force, the faint glimmer of redemption paints his weary face.\" At this point, Jack's state has changed as he has found a measure of redemption and a chance for a better future. His condition can be approximated as a 7 out of 10, as he is on the path to redemption but still faces the consequences of his past actions.\n\n7. The list of the protagonist's condition at each turning point is: 2, 4, 6, 3, 7.\n\n8. Classifying the story arc type based on this list, we can see that the protagonist starts in a low state, rises, falls, and then rises again to a higher state than at the beginning. This pattern most closely resembles the \"Double Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist faces two cycles of dilemma and recovery.\n\n9. The determined story arc type is: Double Man in a Hole."

        "output": "### RESPONSE\n\n1. The protagonist in the story is the Killer.\n\n2. The first turning point (Opportunity) is at sentence 4: \"The target arrives with a dominatrix and the Killer shoots but misses, accidentally shooting the dominatrix.\"\nAt this point, the Killer's state is one of failure and surprise. He has missed his target and accidentally shot someone else. His condition can be approximated as a 4 out of 10.\n\n3. The second turning point (Change of Plans) is at sentence 7: \"The Killer returns to his hideout in the Dominican Republic to find it has been broken into and his girlfriend Magdala has been attacked.\"\nAt this point, the Killer's state has worsened. He has discovered that his hideout has been compromised and his girlfriend has been attacked. This is a significant setback, and his condition can be approximated as a 2 out of 10, which is lower than the first turning point.\n\n4. The third turning point (Point of No Return) is at sentence 10: \"The Killer tracks down Leo, the taxi driver who drove the assassins to the Killer's home by breaking into the company he works for.\"\nAt this point, the Killer has taken action to track down the people responsible for the attack on his girlfriend and has committed to taking revenge. His condition has improved slightly as he is now taking control of the situation, and his condition can be approximated as a 5 out of 10, which is higher than the second turning point.\n\n5. The fourth turning point (Major Setback) is at sentence 21: \"At night, he breaks into the Brute's home to kill him, but he is blindsided and tackled, ensuing a fight during which the Brute realizes who the Killer is before the Killer shoots him and sets his house on fire with a Molotov cocktail.\"\nAt this point, the Killer has faced a significant setback. He was blindsided and tackled, and although he ultimately killed the Brute, his condition has worsened due to the unexpected challenge. His condition can be approximated as a 3 out of 10, which is lower than the third turning point.\n\n6. The fifth turning point (Climax) is at sentence 28: \"Claybourne says that he has no personal problem with him and, as a first-time client of a hitman, agreed to pay Hodges for 'the trail to be scrubbed'.\"\nAt this point, the Killer has finally achieved his goal of finding out who ordered the hit on him and has confronted the person responsible. Although he spared Claybourne's life, he has resolved the main conflict of the story, and his condition has improved. His condition can be approximated as an 8 out of 10, which is higher than the fourth turning point.\n\n7. The list of the protagonist's condition at each turning point is: [4, 2, 5, 3, 8]\n\n8. The story arc type can be classified as \"Man in a Hole\" because the protagonist's condition starts relatively low, falls even lower, and then gradually improves until the climax, where it reaches a high point. This pattern matches the example given for the \"Man in a Hole\" story arc type, where the protagonist's condition improves from the first turning point to the last turning point.\n\n9.

        "output": "### TASK SOLUTION\n\n### 1. Identify the protagonist in the story\nThe protagonist in the story is Sebastian Schlencht-W\u00f6hnert.\n\n### 2. At the sentence indicated by the first turning point, state the sentence again, and describe the protagonist's state\nThe first turning point is Opportunity (tp1) at sentence 4.0: \n\"He also produces YouTube videos about safecracking that receive no attention until a mysterious figure comments on his most recent, inviting him to an underground safecracking competition.\"\nAt this point, Sebastian is still a bank teller but has an opportunity to showcase his safecracking skills. His condition is around 2, as he has a chance to change his mundane life but hasn't taken any action yet.\n\n### 3. Identify the second turning point and state the sentence corresponding to that turning point, and describe how it changed relative to the first turning point\nThe second turning point is Change of Plans (tp2) at sentence 7.0: \n\"Sebastian, a theoretical expert on Wagner's work and safecracking but with no practical experience, is convinced by Gwendoline to join them for the challenge of breaking into a Wagner safe.\"\nAt this point, Sebastian has decided to take a risk and join the heist crew. His condition has improved to around 5, as he now has a sense of purpose and excitement in his life.\n\n### 4. Identify the third turning point and state the sentence corresponding to that turning point, and describe how it changed relative to the second turning point\nThe third turning point is Point of No Return (tp3) at sentence 14.0: \n\"Brad is shot in the shoulder by a security guard and narrowly escapes the bank, ahead of Sebastian and Gwendoline.\"\nAt this point, Sebastian is fully committed to the heist and has experienced a close call. His condition has dropped to around 3, as he is now in a more precarious situation.\n\n### 5. Identify the fourth turning point and state the sentence corresponding to that turning point, and describe how it changed relative to the third turning point\nThe fourth turning point is Major Setback (tp4) at sentence 13.0 (although it seems more suitable at sentence 15): \n\"Sebastian cracks the second safe, leaving with Gwendoline and another haul of money as Delacroix and his team race to the bank to stop them.\" \nHowever, considering sentence 15 as the major setback: \n\"Brad deliberately leaves Sebastian behind as the team flees, forcing him to shake off the pursuing police alone.\"\nAt this point, Sebastian is abandoned by Brad and has to fend for himself. His condition has dropped to around 1, as he is now in a desperate situation.\n\n### 6. Identify the fifth turning point and state the sentence corresponding to that turning point, and describe how it changed relative to the fourth turning point\nThe fifth turning point is Climax (tp5) at sentence 26.0: \n\"He succeeds, finding another large haul of cash.\"\nAt this point, Sebastian has successfully cracked the last safe and found a large amount of money. His condition has improved to around 8, as he has achieved his goal and found love with Gwendoline.\n\n### 7. Approximate the protagonist's condition in the story as a number from 0 to 10 at every turning point\nList of protagonist's condition in chronological order: [2, 5, 3, 1, 8]\n\n### 8. Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition list and explain your reasoning\nThe story arc type is Man in a Hole. The protagonist's condition starts low, rises, falls to a lower point, and then rises again to a higher point. This matches the Man in a Hole story arc, where the protagonist faces a dilemma, falls, and then finds a way out, ending better than at the beginning.\n\n### 9. State the determined story arc type\nMan in a Hole"
