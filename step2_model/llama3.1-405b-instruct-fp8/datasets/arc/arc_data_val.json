She is learning to open up and trust others again.\n\nChange: Edee's condition has increased from Event 9-14, where she was just beginning to recover. She is now making progress in her emotional and psychological healing.\n\n5. At Event 25-26, Edee's state is one of closure and new beginnings. She says goodbye to Miguel and begins to reconnect with her sister, marking a new chapter in her life.\n\nChange: Edee's condition has increased from Event 15-20, where she was still in the process of healing. She is now ready to move forward and start anew.\n\n### Step 3: Classify the story arc type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, I would classify the story arc type as \"Rags to Riches\". Edee starts in a low state, struggling with isolation and survival, and gradually improves as she meets Miguel and develops new skills and relationships. She faces setbacks and challenges along the way, but ultimately emerges stronger and more resilient.\n\nThe story arc follows a clear upward trajectory, with Edee's condition improving from event to event. This is characteristic of the \"Rags to Riches\" story arc, where the protagonist starts in a disadvantaged situation and ends in a much better one.\n\n### Step 4: State the determined story arc type\n\nRags to Riches"

The group discovers the online game \"Survival Mode\" and decides to play it (sentences 3-6).\n2. The game starts to take a dark turn, and the group experiences strange and terrifying occurrences (sentences 8-15).\n3. The group tries to quit the game but realizes they are trapped, and the game continues to escalate the horrors they experience (sentences 16-21).\n4. The group decides to work together to beat the game, analyzing its patterns and rules to survive (sentences 22-27).\n5. The group finally completes the game, but not without scars, and receives a hint that the nightmare may not be over (sentences 28-38).\n\n### TASK 2: Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes at Each Event\n\n1. **Event 1:** The group is in a state of boredom and mundanity due to the quarantine.

They feel helpless and desperate.\n\nState: 1 ( lowest point, feeling hopeless and trapped)\n\n4. **Event 4:** When the group decides to work together to beat the game, their state starts to improve. They feel determined and hopeful again.\n\nState: 5 (improving, feeling more in control)\n\n5. **Event 5:** After completing the game, the group's state is mixed.

to turn the gem into bait, to trap Sullivan.\n34) Their ingenious plot gradually unravels, leading to unearthing not only a baited trap for Sullivan but also revealing his nefarious deeds.\n35) In a daring move, an anonymous dossier compiled with damning evidence against Samuel, including the diamond, is discreetly delivered to the San Francisco Police Department.\n36) Sullivan, once a fearsome figure, now finds himself cornered by the unforgiving grasp of justice.\n37) In the gripping aftermath, the group reconvenes at Joe's Diner, now a sanctuary, sharing a peaceful meal as they reminisce over the whirlwind events.\n38) As if adhering to an unspoken pact, they resume their regular lives.\n39) They each retreat to their familiar roles; the mechanic crippled by the city\u2019s growth, the teacher shaping young minds, the street cleaner subsumed in city grime, the bartender succoring the city\u2019s nocturnal creatures, the librarian in a world of words, the guard watching over sleeping giants, the bank employee in factions of finances, and the gardener tending the city\u2019s green heart.\n40) The extraordinary caper dissolves in the city's bustling rhythm, unseen beneath the majestic shadow of the Golden Gate.\n41) Their shared adventure, unlike their glittering prize, is carefully packed away, only revisited during quiet introspective moments.\n42) The once lost and feared \"Dawn's Tear\" reappears, neatly packaged in a nondescript box, in the SFPD station.\n43) Rumors circulate laden with speculation, yet the true identities of the audacious thieves remain shrouded in mystery.\n44) The reclaimed gem is returned to its protective casing at the Morrison museum, remaining silent amidst the galleries, a testament to the city's untold secrets.\n45) Confounded city officials are left wondering, puzzled over the unresolved enigma of the audacious diamond heist.\n46) The city quickly regains its rhythm, the once electrifying escapade gradually fading into a barely visible thread in San Francisco\u2019s rich tapestry of urban legends.\n47) Beneath their unassuming roles, each individual shoulders a burdening secret, their nondescript appearances masterfully disguising an extraordinary past.\n48) Furtive glances exchanged, fleeting smiles and silent secrets shared over mugs of hot coffee hint towards an unspoken past.\n49) The routine morning chatter cleverly disguises the adrenalized roller-coaster they once embarked on together.\n50) The familiar ambience of the diner, with its vintage walls, silently guards yesterday's secrets.\n51) Lives once lived in obscurity now seethe beneath the surface, tales of suspense, peril and camaraderie hidden out of sight.\n52) An unbreakable bond, formed amidst gunfire and danger, adds invisible threads to their day-to-day lives.\n53) Their collective vow of silence, committed to protect the purity of San Francisco's vibrant dawn, remains unbroken, held sacred within the hallowed space of Joe's Diner.\n54) Another day meets dawn in San Francisco as the city pulsates tirelessly, indifferent to the untold and unheard tales of patrons at Joe's.\n55) The city continues its song, unfazed, narrating the untold tales to its unwitting inhabitants.\n56) The closing scene showcases the panoramic view of San Francisco at dawn.\n57) The first sun rays illuminate Joe's Diner, paying tribute to their silent bond.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better (e.g., 0\u21921\u21922\u21924\u219210)\n- Riches to Rags: Protagonist starts high and ends lower (e.g., 10\u21929\u21928\u21926\u21920)\n- Man in a Hole: Protagonist falls into trouble but recovers (e.g., 6\u21922\u21921\u21924\u219210)\n- Icarus: Protagonist rises then falls dramatically (e.g., 2\u21924\u21929\u21925\u21921)\n- Double Man in a Hole: Two cycles of fall and recovery (e.g., 6\u21922\u21927\u21924\u219210)\n- Cinderella: Rise, setback, ultimate triumph (e.g., 1\u21927\u21924\u21921\u219210)\n- Oedipus: Start high, fall, recover, final fall (e.g., 10\u21924\u21927\u21929\u21921)",

Event 1: Bison finds a tranquil lifestyle in Newark with her partner Tate and feels a growing restlessness (Sentences 2-5).\n2. Event 2: Bison returns to her old stomping grounds, \"The Fight Club,\" and meets Tessa, a young MMA hopeful (Sentences 9-12).\n3. Event 3: Bison's decision to train Tessa causes tension in her relationship with Tate, leading to heated discussions and a silent separation (Sentences 14-18).\n4. Event 4: Bison collapses during a training session and is rushed to the hospital, forcing Tate to confront the harsh reality of her declining health (Sentences 24-26).\n5. Event 5: Bison and Tate reconcile, and Tessa wins her match, fulfilling Bison's legacy in the MMA world (Sentences 29-37).\n\n### STEP 2: Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes at Each Event\n\n1. Event 1: Bison is feeling restless and unfulfilled in her tranquil lifestyle, yearning for excitement and ambition. Her state is relatively low, as she is not satisfied with her current life.\n\nChange: This is the starting point of the story, so there is no previous event to compare to.\n\n2. Event 2: Bison is reengaged with her passion for MMA and finds a new sense of purpose in training Tessa. Her state is improving, as she is now more fulfilled and motivated.\n\nChange: Bison's state has improved relative to Event 1, as she has found a new outlet for her energy and ambition.\n\n3. Event 3: Bison's relationship with Tate is strained, and she is struggling to balance her passion for MMA with her personal life. Her state is worsening, as she is facing conflicts and challenges.\n\nChange: Bison's state has worsened relative to Event 2, as she is now facing personal and relationship challenges.\n\n4. Event 4: Bison's health is declining, and she is forced to confront the consequences of her actions. Her state is at a low point, as she is facing a serious health crisis.\n\nChange: Bison's state has worsened relative to Event 3, as she is now facing a life-threatening situation.\n\n5. Event 5: Bison and Tate reconcile, and Tessa's victory fulfills Bison's legacy in the MMA world. Bison's state is at a high point, as she has found a sense of pride, fulfillment, and balance in her life.\n\nChange: Bison's state has improved significantly relative to Event 4, as she has overcome her health crisis and found a new sense of purpose and fulfillment.\n\n### STEP 3: Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, I would classify the story arc type as Cinderella. This is because Bison starts in a relatively low state (feeling restless and unfulfilled), rises to a higher state (reengaging with her passion for MMA and training Tessa), faces a setback (strained relationship with Tate and health crisis), and ultimately achieves a higher state (reconciling with Tate and fulfilling her legacy in the MMA world).\n\nThe Cinderella story arc type is characterized by a rise, a fall, and a final rise to a higher state, which matches the trajectory of Bison's story.\n\n### STEP 4: State the Determined Story Arc Type\n\nCinderella"

        "output": "### Task 1: Identify the protagonist and 5 major events in the story\n\nThe protagonist in the story is John Smith, a dedicated construction worker.\n\nThe 5 major events in the story are:\n\n1. John is haunted by colorful dreams about an aquatic planet and a spectral woman (sentences 1-4).\n2. John discovers an ancient artifact on the construction site, which sets him on a journey to uncover its secrets (sentences 5-12).\n3. John and his team face numerous challenges on their journey to Neptune, including corporate forces trying to stop them (sentences 17-30).\n4. John and his team successfully land on Neptune, meet Eris, and learn about the alien technology and its potential dangers (sentences 31-38).\n5. John and his team defeat the corporate forces and decide to stay on Neptune as guardians of the cosmic order (sentences 39-49).\n\n### Task 2: Describe the protagonist's state and how it changed at each event\n\n1. At the beginning, John is haunted by his dreams and feels a sense of bewilderment and perplexity. His state is low due to the uncertainty and confusion caused by his dreams.\n2. When John discovers the artifact, his state improves slightly as he becomes more curious and determined to uncover its secrets. However, he is still uncertain about the implications of his discovery.\n3. As John and his team face challenges on their journey to Neptune, John's state worsens due to the stress, fear, and dissent among his team members. He is struggling to keep his team together and overcome the obstacles they face.\n4. When John and his team successfully land on Neptune and meet Eris, John's state improves significantly. He gains a new understanding of the alien technology and its potential dangers, and he finds a sense of purpose and belonging.\n5. After defeating the corporate forces and deciding to stay on Neptune, John's state reaches its highest point. He has found a new sense of identity and purpose as a guardian of the cosmic order, and he is determined to protect the universe from those who would misuse its secrets.\n\n### Task 3: Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain your reasoning\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, I would classify the story arc type as \"Double Man in a Hole.\" This is because John's state worsens twice (once when he is haunted by his dreams and again when he faces challenges on his journey to Neptune) and improves twice (once when he discovers the artifact and again when he successfully lands on Neptune and defeats the corporate forces). The \"Double Man in a Hole\" story arc type is characterized by two cycles of dilemma and recovery, which is evident in John's journey.\n\n### Task 4: State the determined story arc type\n\nDouble Man in a Hole"

At the beginning of the story, Auden is uncertain and trying to reinvent herself after graduating from high school. She's in a relatively low state, having just arrived in a new town and trying to adjust to her father's new family (State: 2).\n2. When Auden meets Eli, she starts to experience new things and have fun, which improves her state. She's more confident and carefree (State: 5, Change: +3).\n3. However, when her mother visits, Auden realizes her father's mistakes and feels frustrated and disappointed. Her state takes a slight dip (State: 4, Change: -1).\n4. The temporary falling out with Eli over biking makes Auden feel insecure and uncertain again. Her state drops further (State: 3, Change: -1).\n5. Finally, when Auden and Eli make up, and she experiences the prom she never had, her state improves significantly. She's happy, confident, and has found a sense of belonging (State: 9, Change: +6).\n\n**Task 3: Classify the story arc type and explain reasoning**\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, I would classify the story arc type as \"Rags to Riches\". Here's my reasoning:\n\n* Auden starts in a relatively low state (2) and ends in a significantly higher state (9).\n* Her state improves gradually throughout the story, with some minor setbacks (e.g., the temporary falling out with Eli).\n* The overall trend is upward, with Auden becoming more confident, carefree, and happy as the story progresses.\n* The story follows the typical \"Rags to Riches\" pattern, where the protagonist starts in a disadvantaged situation and ends in a much better one.\n\n**Task 4: State the determined story arc type**\n\nRags to Riches"

        "output": "### TASK 1\nThe protagonist in the story is Albert Bennett, a stoic businessman. However, an argument can be made that the story also heavily focuses on Amelia's journey and character development, making her a potential co-protagonist or even the main protagonist. For this analysis, we will consider Albert as the primary protagonist.\n\nFive major events in the story are:\n\n1. Albert's decision to relocate to the Gothic mansion in Colorado (Sentence 5)\n2. The family's initial experience with the eerie mansion, including the discovery of its dark history (Sentences 7-10)\n3. Amelia's uncovering of Albert's connection to the mansion's past (Sentences 17-18)\n4. Albert's confession of his guilt and the vengeful spirit's demand for retribution (Sentences 23-26)\n5. Albert's death and the aftermath (Sentences 27-32)\n\n### TASK 2\nNow, let's analyze Albert's state at each event and how it changed relative to the previous events.\n\n1. Initially, Albert is portrayed as a successful businessman with a seemingly perfect life. However, the introduction of his past and the relocation to the mansion reveal underlying issues. At this point, Albert's state is one of unease and avoidance.\n\nChange: Albert's decision to relocate marks a turning point, as he attempts to escape his past, but ultimately sets himself up for a downfall.\n\n2. As the family experiences the eerie mansion, Albert's state deteriorates. He becomes increasingly erratic and distant from his family.\n\nChange: Albert's condition worsens as the strange events escalate, and he struggles to maintain his composure.\n\n3. When Amelia uncovers Albert's connection to the mansion's past, his state reaches a critical point. He is forced to confront the secrets he has been hiding.\n\nChange: Albert's condition takes a significant hit as his secrets are revealed, and he is faced with the consequences of his actions.\n\n4. Albert's confession and the vengeful spirit's demand for retribution mark a point of no return. He is consumed by guilt and regret.\n\nChange: Albert's state reaches its lowest point as he acknowledges his wrongdoing and accepts the punishment.\n\n5. Ultimately, Albert's death serves as a tragic conclusion to his story arc.\n\nChange: Albert's condition ends in a state of defeat and loss, a drastic decline from his initial successful and seemingly perfect life.\n\n### TASK 3\nBased on Albert's condition throughout the story, the story arc type can be classified as **Oedipus**. This classification is due to Albert's initial high state, followed by a downfall as his past catches up with him, a brief recovery as he attempts to make amends, and ultimately, a significant downfall as he faces the consequences of his actions.\n\nHowever, if we consider Amelia as the protagonist or co-protagonist, the story arc type could be classified as **Man in a Hole**. Amelia faces a series of challenges and setbacks, but ultimately emerges stronger and more resilient, having overcome the horrors of the mansion and the revelation of Albert's past.\n\n### STORY ARC TYPE\n**Oedipus** (if Albert is considered the primary protagonist) or **Man in a Hole** (if Amelia is considered the primary protagonist or co-protagonist)"

a 12-year-old boy.\n3) We observe Billy engrossed in timeless childhood pleasures - playing fetch with his faithful Golden Retriever named Daisy, pedaling his bicycle along narrowing streets framed by towering maple trees, and spending quiet afternoons fishing by the gentle stream, his laughter rippling through the air blending with the trickling sound of water.\n4) One sparkling Saturday, a lively block party brings the usually calm Elm Street alive with eager activity.\n5) Enticed by the infectious joviality, Billy attends the party, his big round eyes wide with wonder.\n6) Amid the smoky barbecue scent and loud laughter echoing through the air, he finds himself captivated by Melissa Meyer.\n7) His gaze fixates on the gracefully elegant woman in her late twenties from the moment he sets his eyes on her.\n8) The charisma she exudes due to her city-bred confidence engulfs Billy in an unprecedented whirlpool of feelings.\n9) Being a sophisticated attorney straight from the bustling city of New York, Melissa adorns the quiet suburban block with a cosmopolitan aura that naturally magnetizes the naive Billy towards her.\n10) Overwhelmed by this alien sensation, Billy dares to approach her.\n11) He offers Melissa a marriage proposal - spontaneous and innocent.\n12) Melissa, taken by surprise, bursts into laughter and gently declines his proposal.\n13) This gentle refusal punches Billy's heart like a crushing blow.\n14) Rejection washes over his innocence, and he flees from the laughter-filled party, abandoning the utopia he has held so dear.\n15) Desperate for understanding, Billy confides in his older brother, John - a charismatic artist famed for his charm with women.\n16) John, as a responsible elder brother, takes it upon himself to tutor Billy.\n17) His unique curriculum centers around the art of dealing with older women with finesse and grace.\n18) Even as Billy follows his brother's advice diligently, we see Melissa battling her stressful city life.\n19) Her demanding corporate lawyer job, the emotional turmoil of a painful break-up, and the society-inflicted apprehension of nearing thirty hold her captive in constant stress.\n20) On his mission to win Melissa's heart, Billy unknowingly becomes a regular visitor to her life.\n21) His innocent antics offer her a comic respite from her cookie-cutter life, lifting her spirits in an unexpectedly delightful way.\n22) Billy's persona, under the guiding hand of John, starts undergoing changes.\n23) Observing these gradual changes in Billy, Melissa finds herself amused.\n24) As the relationship between Billy and Melissa burgeons, a protective instinct awakens in her.\n25) She looks at him fondly, more like an elder sister rather than a romantic interest, desperately wishing to preserve his innocence against the harsh light of heartbreak.\n26) Billy, blinded by his so-called love, misunderstands her protectiveness as romantic feelings and proposes to Melissa again.\n27) This time around, the rejection hits Billy harder.\n28) He hangs on the event's edges, left alone to grapple with his deeper heartache.\n29) A dejected Billy distances himself from Melissa, retreating into isolation to mend his bruised heart.\n30) His departure leaves Melissa facing an unexpected void, which she hadn't anticipated.\n31) Reflecting on their interaction, Melissa decides to mend her relationship with Billy.\n32) She offers him a crystal-clear explanation of their life's significant disparities and suggests they should be friends.\n33) Freshly hurt Billy dismisses her olive branch immediately.\n34) In his absence, Melissa gets an insight into Billy's simplistic view of life.\n35) As the pain of his unrequited love eases with time, Billy embarks on a journey of self-awareness.\n36) He realizes his infatuation for Melissa was merely a stepping stone into his adolescence.\n37) Embracing this newfound wisdom, he accepts Melissa's offer of friendship.\n38) His acceptance comes from a place of maturity, not as a consolation prize for his lost love.\n39) As our story gradually unfolds, we find Billy and Melissa at another lively neighborhood party on Elm Street.\n40) Only this time, they appear as friends, no longer hostage to Billy's romantic pursuit.\n41) They share a dance, a casual two-step - a symbol of their friendship.\n42) Their dance subtly hints at a bond beyond societal expectations and norms, a testament to their mutual respect and adoration.\n43) Throughout the story, we witness Billy navigating through the maze of love, overcoming the agony of rejection, progressing from the cocooned world of boyhood to the complex world of adolescence.\n44) In contrast, Melissa manages to rekindle her connection with the youthful innocence she had misplaced amidst her adult responsibilities.\n45) She learns to ease her overbearing adult consciousness and starts discovering joy in the simple things in life.\n46) Our story thus revolves around an unexpected friendship that smudges the distinctive lines of societal norms, a narrative where age and maturity become blurred lines of reference.\n47) It outlines a refreshing side of first love, imbued with the melodrama of adolescence, the poignant reality of unrequited love, and the sweet simplicity of friendship.\n48) This story inquires into a young boy's hurried plot to steer towards adulthood while tracing a woman's journey of unlearning her engrossed adult seriousness to embrace the carefree joys of youth.\n49) As the plot unfolds, both characters become surfaces of emotional evolution - their parallel journeys generating lessons of self-discovery, love, and the myriad layers of maturity.\n50) Billy's transformation from being a naive boy to a well-rounded young man capable of treading life's intricacies forms a compelling arc within the tale.\n51) Equally engaging is Melissa's transformation from an overburdened adult to a woman who finds solace and happiness in Billy's uncomplicated world.\n52) The lives of these two characters, though separate, cross several times, weaving a fulfilling narrative tapestry full of drama, humor, and emotional growth.\n53) The conclusion beautifully encapsulates their enduring friendship and personal growth, symbolized by a harmonious dance between Billy and Melissa.\n54) Titled \"Connecticut Crush: Smooth Moves, Tough Age,\", the movie weaves an emotionally resonant narrative.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better (e.g., 0\u21921\u21922\u21924\u219210)\n- Riches to Rags: Protagonist starts high and ends lower (e.g., 10\u21929\u21928\u21926\u21920)\n- Man in a Hole: Protagonist falls into trouble but recovers (e.g., 6\u21922\u21921\u21924\u219210)\n- Icarus: Protagonist rises then falls dramatically (e.g., 2\u21924\u21929\u21925\u21921)\n- Double Man in a Hole: Two cycles of fall and recovery (e.g., 6\u21922\u21927\u21924\u219210)\n- Cinderella: Rise, setback, ultimate triumph (e.g., 1\u21927\u21924\u21921\u219210)\n- Oedipus: Start high, fall, recover, final fall (e.g., 10\u21924\u21927\u21929\u21921)",

Beyah is blamed for the catastrophe and nearly sacrificed by Odal, but she escapes (Event 12).\n4. Beyah discovers the Neanderthal's cave, kills the male Neanderthal, and finds Heron unharmed (Events 18-20).\n5. Beyah kills the female Neanderthal, escapes the cave, and decides to start a new life with Heron (Events 23-29).\n\n### TASK 2: Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes at Each Event\n\n1. At the first event, Beyah is part of a struggling group, and her state is precarious. When Heron is abducted, the group's situation worsens, and Beyah's state becomes more desperate.\n2. After Adem's death, Beyah takes charge and suggests cannibalizing his body to avoid starvation. Although this decision is difficult, it shows Beyah's resourcefulness and determination to survive. Her state has improved slightly, as she has taken control of her situation.\n3. When Beyah is blamed for the catastrophe and nearly sacrificed, her state plummets. She is forced to fight for her life and escape from her own group members.\n4. After discovering the Neanderthal's cave and killing the male Neanderthal, Beyah's state improves significantly. She has found a potential new home and has rescued Heron.\n5. After killing the female Neanderthal and escaping the cave, Beyah's state improves further. She has overcome her challenges and has decided to start a new life with Heron. She has also learned valuable lessons about survival and the importance of understanding and respecting other human beings.\n\n### TASK 3: Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on Beyah's state throughout the story, the story arc type can be classified as a \"Double Man in a Hole.\" Beyah's state starts low, falls even lower, recovers, falls again, and then recovers once more. This pattern is characteristic of the \"Double Man in a Hole\" story arc, where the protagonist faces two cycles of dilemma and recovery.\n\nThe story arc can be visualized as follows:\n\nLow (Beyah is part of a struggling group) -> Lower (Heron is abducted) -> Slight improvement (Beyah takes charge after Adem's death) -> Low (Beyah is blamed and nearly sacrificed) -> Improvement (Beyah discovers the Neanderthal's cave and rescues Heron) -> Higher (Beyah kills the female Neanderthal and starts a new life with Heron)\n\n### STORY ARC TYPE\n\nDouble Man in a Hole"

His state is one of desperation and disappointment. He had hoped to reconnect with his past and start anew, but he is met with rejection and indifference.\n\nRelative change: Stevens' state has worsened since his release from prison.

Here's why:\n\n* Stevens starts in a low state, having just been released from prison and facing an uncertain future.\n* He rises to a higher state when he meets Eddie and secures a job, but then faces a setback when his past is revealed and he is shunned by the community.\n* Ultimately, Stevens achieves a higher state than before, coaching the 'Green Giants' to a championship victory and earning the respect and acceptance of the community.\n\nThis pattern of rising, falling, and then rising again to a higher state is characteristic of the Cinderella story arc type.\n\n### TASK 4: State the Determined Story Arc Type\n\nCinderella"

Falk returns to his hometown of Kiewarra for the funeral of his childhood friend Luke Hadler. (Sentence 1)\n2. Falk begins investigating the crime, despite the townspeople's animosity towards him. (Sentence 6)\n3. Falk discovers that the shotgun shells used in the crime were Remingtons, while Luke only owned Winchesters, casting doubt on Luke's guilt. (Sentence 7)\n4. Falk uncovers the truth that Scott Whitlam is the actual murderer and confronts him, leading to Whitlam's confession and attempted self-immolation. (Sentences 18-22)\n5. Falk clears his own name by finding evidence that proves his innocence in Ellie's death and says goodbye to her memory. (Sentences 28-31)\n\n### TASK 2: Describe the protagonist's state at each event and how it changed relative to the previous events\n\n1. At the beginning of the story, Falk is in a low state, having returned to a town where he is disliked and suspected of murder. His emotional state is one of reluctance and unease.\n2. As Falk begins investigating the crime, his state improves slightly, as he becomes more engaged and determined to uncover the truth. However, he still faces hostility from the townspeople, which keeps his overall state relatively low.\n3. When Falk discovers the discrepancy in the shotgun shells, his state improves further, as he gains confidence in his investigation and starts to uncover evidence that may clear Luke's name.\n4. Confronting Whitlam and closing the case brings Falk a sense of satisfaction and vindication, improving his state significantly. However, the confrontation also puts him in physical danger, and he suffers injuries while saving Whitlam from the fire.\n5. Finally, clearing his own name and finding closure with Ellie's death brings Falk a sense of peace and redemption, elevating his state to a higher level than at the beginning of the story.\n\n### TASK 3: Classify the story arc type based on the protagonist's condition throughout and explain your reasoning\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, I would classify the story arc type as \"Double Man in a Hole\". Here's why:\n\n* Falk starts in a low state, returning to a town where he is disliked and suspected of murder (the first \"hole\").\n* As he investigates the crime, he faces setbacks and hostility, but also makes progress and improves his state (the first recovery).\n* However, the investigation also puts him in physical danger, and he suffers injuries, causing his state to dip again (the second \"hole\").\n* Ultimately, Falk emerges victorious, clearing his own name and finding closure with Ellie's death, elevating his state to a higher level than at the beginning of the story (the second recovery).\n\nThis pattern of two cycles of dilemma and recovery matches the \"Double Man in a Hole\" story arc type.\n\n### STORY ARC TYPE\n\nDouble Man in a Hole"

At the first event, Nathan is in a state of shock and grief upon learning of his father's death. This is a low point for Nathan.\n2. At the second event, Nathan is still processing his emotions, but being reunited with his sister and exploring their childhood home brings back fond memories.

At the third event, Nathan's state worsens as he discovers the dark secrets of his father's past and is confronted with the supernatural occurrences. This is another low point for Nathan.\n4. At the fourth event, Nathan faces his fears and helps his mother's spirit find peace. This is a turning point for Nathan, and his state begins to improve.\n5. At the fifth event, Nathan has come to terms with his father's past and is able to forgive him. He is also reunited with his sister, and they are able to move forward together.

after feeding the coordinates into the deviator, Kevin is shifted to that universe.\n32) Molly in that universe is upset by conversation with Kevin, suggesting that they both should move on and reminding him that break-up of their marriage was initiated by him - but Kevin also feels that their relationship could be still revived.\n33) Suddenly the Benefactor returns Kevin to the totalitarian universe, shifts Tina to Russo's cinema and tells Kevin that he should choose between restoring Tina to her family (never to see Molly again) and staying with Molly forever after accepting the Benefactor's offer to become his shifter.\n34) Kevin decides to give Tina her life back, and immediately after that he's suddenly shifted to another reality.\n35) In that reality, Molly is the nurse and single mother he saw previously and doesn't recognise him.\n36) He strikes up a conversation similar to their first meeting, and the two get married once again.\n37) Kevin states that although this is not his universe, it is his home.\n38) He's seen playing with his newborn son and his adopted daughter, proving that he was given double what he lost.\n39) In a post-credits scene, Kristoffer Polaha (who portrays Kevin in the film) thanks all viewers for watching the film and briefly mentions the inspirations for its screenplay and behind its production.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better (e.g., 0\u21921\u21922\u21924\u219210)\n- Riches to Rags: Protagonist starts high and ends lower (e.g., 10\u21929\u21928\u21926\u21920)\n- Man in a Hole: Protagonist falls into trouble but recovers (e.g., 6\u21922\u21921\u21924\u219210)\n- Icarus: Protagonist rises then falls dramatically (e.g., 2\u21924\u21929\u21925\u21921)\n- Double Man in a Hole: Two cycles of fall and recovery (e.g., 6\u21922\u21927\u21924\u219210)\n- Cinderella: Rise, setback, ultimate triumph (e.g., 1\u21927\u21924\u21921\u219210)\n- Oedipus: Start high, fall, recover, final fall (e.g., 10\u21924\u21927\u21929\u21921)",

Deacon takes vacation leave from his station to assist in solving Baxter's case, despite being advised not to get involved (Sentence 9).\n3. Deacon and Baxter's investigation leads to the identification of Albert Sparma as a suspect, but Sparma is released after provoking Deacon into an angry outburst (Sentences 13-15).\n4. Deacon and Baxter continue investigating Sparma, leading to an illegal search of his apartment and a confrontation that ends with Sparma's death (Sentences 21-30).\n5. Deacon helps Baxter cover up Sparma's death and advises him to forget about the case, before returning to Kern County to destroy evidence and reflect on his past mistakes (Sentences 32-37).\n\n### Task 2: Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. At the first event, Deacon is in a relatively neutral state, carrying out his duties as a deputy sheriff. However, it is revealed that he has a troubled past and is haunted by an unsolved case (Sentence 8).\n   State: 6 (neutral with a hint of past troubles)\n\n2. At the second event, Deacon's state worsens as he becomes obsessed with solving the case, despite being advised not to get involved. This obsession is driven by his past failure and his desire for redemption.\n   State: 4 (lower than before, as his obsession takes over)\n\n3. At the third event, Deacon's state falls further as he is provoked by Sparma and loses his temper. This outburst reveals Deacon's emotional vulnerability and his deep-seated anger.\n   State: 2 (lower than before, as he loses control)\n\n4. At the fourth event, Deacon's state appears to improve as he and Baxter close in on Sparma. However, this is a temporary high, as the confrontation ends in disaster and Sparma's death.\n   State: 7 (briefly higher, but ultimately a false peak)\n\n5. At the fifth event, Deacon's state falls to a new low as he is forced to confront the consequences of his actions and the darkness of his own past.

This is because Deacon starts in a relatively high state, falls to a low point, briefly recovers, and then falls to an even lower point. This pattern matches the Oedipus story arc, which is characterized by a high-low-high-low trajectory.\n\nDeacon's story arc is marked by a series of downward spirals, as he becomes increasingly obsessed with solving the case and is forced to confront the darkness of his own past. Despite brief moments of recovery, Deacon's overall trajectory is one of decline and despair.\n\n### Task 4: State the Determined Story Arc Type\n\nOedipus"

Lofthouse discovers that most of Earth's population has been obliterated and he is left alone at the Arctic base (Event 5-7).\n4. Lofthouse meets the young mute girl, Iris, and grows fond of her, which motivates him to contact the Aether crew (Events 12-15).\n5. Lofthouse successfully contacts the Aether crew and learns that Iris Sullivan is his daughter, and he finally feels a sense of connection and pride (Events 25-30).\n\n### TASK 2: Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\nHere's a description of Lofthouse's state at each event and how it changed relative to the previous events:\n\n1. Event 2: Lofthouse meets Jean Sullivan and they form a romantic relationship. Lofthouse's state is high, as he has found someone who cares for him. (State: 8/10)\n2. Event 3-4: Jean leaves Lofthouse, and he chooses not to meet their daughter. Lofthouse's state falls to a low point, as he has lost the person he cares about and is left with his own obsession. (State: 2/10)\n3. Event 5-7: Lofthouse discovers that most of Earth's population has been obliterated, and he is left alone at the Arctic base. Lofthouse's state falls even further, as he is now isolated and struggling to survive. (State: 1/10)\n4. Event 12-15: Lofthouse meets the young mute girl, Iris, and grows fond of her. Lofthouse's state improves slightly, as he has found someone to care for and a new sense of purpose. (State: 4/10)\n5.

The story follows two cycles of dilemma and recovery:\n\n* The first cycle: Lofthouse falls from a high state (Event 2) to a low state (Event 3-4) and then recovers slightly (Event 12-15).\n* The second cycle: Lofthouse falls again to a low state (Event 5-7) and then recovers to a high state (Event 25-30).\n\nThe story arc type is a Double Man in a Hole because Lofthouse faces two significant downturns (losing Jean and facing the apocalypse) but ultimately recovers and finds a sense of connection and pride.\n\n### TASK 4: State the Determined Story Arc Type\n\nDouble Man in a Hole"

However, her journey is not a straightforward one; she faces multiple setbacks and challenges along the way, including her cardiac crisis and her eventual death. Despite these setbacks, Jane's determination and resilience ultimately lead to a positive outcome, and her legacy lives on.\n\nThe Double Man in a Hole story arc type is characterized by two cycles of dilemma and recovery, which is evident in Jane's story.

She appears to recover slightly on the film set (Event 3), but her emotional pain is still evident. Her breakdown on set (Event 4) marks a significant decline, and her discovery of Gabe and Blair's affair (Event 5) pushes her to a new low.\n\nThe Oedipus story arc fits this narrative, as Allison's condition follows a pattern of decline, recovery, and then another significant downfall.\n\n### 4.

the miniaturized model undergoes a rapid metamorphosis, expanding into an impeccably replicated full-scale G-19 Hawk aircraft bursting with tiny, proportionate passengers.\n7) Taking everyone off guard, the plane's engines thunder into action, propelling it gliding across his living room floor and out through his unanticipatedly large, Victorian-era bay window.\n8) The pilotless aircraft miraculously navigates its way around the city's towering skyline, demonstrating swift and precise maneuvering skills while earning incredulous stares from the city's bustling crowd of residents.\n9) Fearful of the potential catastrophe an errant, uncontrolled aircraft could cause in a densely populated city, Daryl along with a bewildered Chloe conjure up a hasty but essential plan for their impromptu mission -

Vail's initial refusal to go on a mission with Kate (sentences 1-3).\n2. Vail's decision to join the mission after being attacked (sentences 5-6).\n3. Vail's encounter with Radek and the subsequent failure to catch him (sentences 35-38).\n4. Vail's suspicion of O'Malley as the mole and the temporary rift with Kate (sentences 40-42).\n5. Vail's final confrontation with Radek and his ultimate success in stopping him (sentences 66-71).\n\n### TASK 2: Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event\n\n1. Initially, Vail is in a state of contentment and retirement, having moved on from his past life as an agent (sentences 3-4). His state is relatively high.\n\nState: 8\n\n2. After being attacked, Vail's state changes to one of concern and a sense of duty to join the mission. His state is lower than before, but he is more engaged.\n\nState: 5\n\n3. After failing to catch Radek, Vail's state is one of frustration and disappointment. His state is lower than before.\n\nState: 3\n\n4. When Vail suspects O'Malley as the mole, his state is one of distrust and uncertainty. His state is still relatively low.\n\nState: 4\n\n5. After successfully stopping Radek, Vail's state is one of redemption and closure. His state is higher than before.\n\nState: 9\n\n### TASK 3: Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, the story arc type can be classified as \"Double Man in a Hole.\" This is because Vail faces two cycles of dilemma and recovery: first, when he is attacked and joins the mission, and second, when he suspects O'Malley as the mole and eventually clears his name and stops Radek.\n\nIn both cycles, Vail's state falls and then rises, indicating a \"Man in a Hole\" pattern. The fact that this pattern repeats itself twice in the story makes it a \"Double Man in a Hole\" arc.\n\n### Determined Story Arc Type\n\nDouble Man in a Hole"

Bailey who holds a notorious reputation for her complete lack of dancing abilities lands up as the de facto techno-manager of her university's acclaimed dance team, The Pelicans.\n4) The Pelicans are well-regarded for an unbroken winning streak in the fiercely competitive annual 5-College Dance Showdown.\n5) The following act brings into focus Bailey's hard-fought struggles to fit in with the

It is also not a Man in a Hole or Icarus, as Bailey does not face a single dramatic downfall or rise to success followed by a drastic downfall.

her eyes repeatedly dart between an acceptance letter from Stanford University\u2019s esteemed research PhD program and a compelling job offer as an assistant professor from Yale University.\n5) These letters represent the diverging paths her future might take, leaving Jane in a predicament that feels equally exciting and overwhelming.\n6) The prospect of sinking into the world of research at Stanford, a university she has idealised since high school, draws her in with its allure.\n7) On the other hand, the promise of a secure, tenure-track position at Yale seems like the more practical choice.\n8) Riddled with indecision, Jane is in dire need of a retreat.\n9) Jane withdraws to her sanctuary amidst the chaos -

supposedly, it was an enchanted prison for a powerful and ill-tempered witch, captured by a wise shaman centuries before their time.\n30) Soon, whispers of Jane's encounter with the paranormal spread like wildfire around Silverint, their amicable townsfolk now treating her more skeptically, as if she were a magnet for unnatural energies.\n31) Jane found herself being treated differently.\n32) The food from the local diner had a strange, sour taste, and even Dash resorted to snarling every time she made an attempt to pet him.\n33) Distressed, lonely, and feeling the isolation more than ever, Jane yet refused to give in to the malevolent entity.\n34) Drawing upon her final reserves of energy, she fortified her resolve and swore to reclaim her peaceful life from the manifestations.\n35) Bearing her ordeal, Jane turned to Father Patrick, the town's well-respected priest and spiritual guide.\n36) She also sought help from Octavia, an elderly woman revered for her knowledge of historical lore and antiques, hoping to find a solution.\n37) They revealed to Jane an ancient local legend, a popular but largely untested folk tale about a mythical vault hidden deep within the heart of Thorne island.\n38) Folklore suggested that this vault contained magic powerful enough to reverse Jane\u2019s chilling encounters.\n39) Octavia, glancing ominously at Jane, shared a puzzling clue: the vault would only make itself visible during the rare event of a lunar eclipse.\n40) This, she divulged, was to occur just the following night.\n41) High on nerves, Jane began her intense preparations as per the detailed rituals from Silverint's lore.\n42) She read ancient texts, memorized enchantments and mentally rehearsed the sacred rites necessary to combat the unseen enemy.\n43) Sensing her resolve, the vindictive spirit took a terrifying step.\n44) The peaceful tranquility of Jane's house ruptured into flames.\n45) Once a serene solace, her home now seemed to be a war zone, engulfed in an inferno and trying to consume her.\n46) Jane barely managed to escape the inferno, risked her life and dashed out into the darkness, only escaping with minor burns and a relentless spirit, fueled further by the desperate countermeasures the entity took.\n47) On the night of the lunar eclipse, armed with nothing but her courage and a series of chants, Jane set off into the eerie wilderness of Thorne, braving supernatural obstacles set by the vengeful spirit, towards the unseen vault.\n48) As she confronted the ghastly apparition, adrenaline coursing wildly through her veins, the only weapon she found she possessed was her  unwavering courage, resolute determination, and the disappearance of her previous reservations.\n49) With her relentless will, she fought and triumphed, successfully trapping the malevolent entity, trapping it back into the confines of the lustrous brass locket.\n50) She lodged the now dormant locket into an ancient stone niche within the concealed vault and sealed it shut, just as the last fragment of the lunar eclipse dissipated into the ebony sky.\n51) Life gradually began to find its way back to Jane.\n52) The town's folks' previously wary outlooks softened, Dash\u2019s playful spirit resurfaced, and Jane began to see a glimmer of her old, tranquil life.\n53) Jane\u2019s lifestyle morphed significantly in the succeeding days.\n54) She began to frequent Silverint more often and started to build forts of friendship with the once estranged townsfolk.\n55) Jane had gone from the reclusive 'island woman' to becoming a symbol of resilience, a beacon of courage and a testament to determination for the entire town.\n56) In conclusion, Jane is seen calmly watching the sun rise from her fixed up cabin porch, the sense of fulfillment and empowerment radiating from her was infectious, giving the audience a final sense of satisfaction after her considerable journey.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better (e.g., 0\u21921\u21922\u21924\u219210)\n- Riches to Rags: Protagonist starts high and ends lower (e.g., 10\u21929\u21928\u21926\u21920)\n- Man in a Hole: Protagonist falls into trouble but recovers (e.g., 6\u21922\u21921\u21924\u219210)\n- Icarus: Protagonist rises then falls dramatically (e.g., 2\u21924\u21929\u21925\u21921)\n- Double Man in a Hole: Two cycles of fall and recovery (e.g., 6\u21922\u21927\u21924\u219210)\n- Cinderella: Rise, setback, ultimate triumph (e.g., 1\u21927\u21924\u21921\u219210)\n- Oedipus: Start high, fall, recover, final fall (e.g., 10\u21924\u21927\u21929\u21921)",

The aftermath of John's revelations, including the police investigation and John's emotional struggle to comprehend his victory (sentence 30).\n\n**Task 2: Describe the Protagonist's State and Changes at Each Event**\n\n1. At the first event, John is in a state of curiosity and mild concern. He is beginning to notice strange connections between his work and Liz's, but he is not yet aware of the full extent of her activities. Compared to his initial state of comfort and confidence, John's state has slightly worsened.\n2. At the second event, John is in a state of shock and alarm. He has discovered the sinister anatomy lab and is starting to suspect that Liz is involved in something horrific. Compared to the previous event, John's state has significantly worsened.\n3. At the third event, John is in a state of horror and despair. He has realized the truth about Liz's activities and is struggling to come to terms with the fact that he has been blind to her actions.

Kurt's college football career is at risk due to his poor performance, but he improves and becomes a potential draft pick (sentences 3-5).\n3.

Event 1: Kurt is inspired and committed to his dream, with a high sense of hope and ambition. His state is optimistic and determined.\n2. Event 2: Kurt's state improves as he overcomes his initial struggles in college football and becomes a potential draft pick. He is more confident and hopeful about his future.\n3. Event 3: Kurt's state drastically worsens as he faces disappointment and hardship after not being drafted. He becomes homeless and struggles to make ends meet, feeling defeated and uncertain about his future.\n4. Event 4: Kurt's state improves as he gets a chance to play for the Arena Football League's Iowa Barnstormers and eventually marries Brenda.

He is triumphant, proud, and fulfilled.\n\n### TASK 3: Classify the Story Arc Type\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, I classify the story arc type as a Double Man in a Hole. Here's my reasoning:\n\n* Kurt starts with high hopes and ambition (Event 1), but faces a significant setback when he's not drafted and becomes homeless (Event 3). This is the first \"hole\" he falls into.\n* However, Kurt recovers and improves his situation by playing for the Arena Football League's Iowa Barnstormers and marrying Brenda (Event 4). This is the first \"recovery\" phase.\n* Kurt then faces another significant challenge as he tries to make it in the NFL, but ultimately achieves his dream of becoming a Super Bowl and MVP quarterback (Event 5). This is the second \"recovery\" phase, which is even higher than the first one.\n\nThe Double Man in a Hole story arc type fits this narrative because Kurt faces two cycles of dilemma and recovery, with each recovery phase leading to a higher state than the previous one.\n\n### TASK 4: State the Determined Story Arc Type\n\nDouble Man in a Hole"

It is not \"Cinderella\" because Roberts does not rise, face a setback, and ultimately achieve a higher state. It is not \"Oedipus\" because Roberts does not start high, fall, recover, and then face another significant downfall.\n\n### TASK 4: End by simply stating the determined story arc type.\n\nMan in a Hole"

the Serenity Orb.\n23) Dejected but not defeated, Arthur spearheads their way back to Dovecliff.\n24) He was propelled by the hope that perhaps they missed a crucial clue buried in the ancient folio.\n25) In a decisive revelation, Arthur understood the riddle inscribed beneath the cryptic runic symbols.\n26) They spoke of the Whispering Depths, a network of caves untouched by Dovecliff's inhabitants for centuries.\n27) An inner light reflected on Arthur's face as it dawned on him that the Serenity Orb was probably hidden in the concealed Whispering Depths and not on Mt.\n28) Solitaire's frozen peak.\n29) Arthur's rekindled spirit, Lucy's unwavering faith, and a weary John, now grappling with Pneumosis, boldly ventured into the shadowy cave system beneath their village.\n30) The trio faced countless threatening caves, their faith wavering but never shattering.\n31) Eventually, their perseverance led them to the Serenity Orb, a splendid sight to their sore eyes, shining resplendently in the eerie cave.\n32) Their moment of triumph, however, was short-lived as the \"Summit Seekers\" launched a surprise assault on them in the isolated depths of the cave.\n33) The ensuing scuffle resulted in John taking a lethal blow to his abdomen, sacrificing himself to shield his young companions from the deadly assault.\n34) Despite the crisis, Arthur and Lucy managed to overpower their ambushers, their determination turning the grim situation around.\n35) Rushing back to Dovecliff, infected and frantic, they used the Serenity Orb's healing powers.\n36) Within a night, the feeble village staggered back to life, and they became the unsung heroes Dovecliff needed.\n37) Arthur, desperate to save John, implores the Serenity Orb to spare his life, promising to return the Orb once John recovers.\n38) Miraculously, John pulls back from death's grip, and Arthur, true to his word, returns the Orb to its earthen cradle, demonstrating his exceptional integrity.\n39) Dovecliff basks in the delight of restored health and peace, as Arthur and Lucy, affirmed their profound love for each other amidst the celebrations, their laughter echoing through the reinvented village.\n40) The epilogue unfolds with Margret Ascender, Arthur's matured, wise daughter, narrating the epic journey to her grandchildren, their little eyes full of awe and curiosity.\n41) Margret, in her affectionate voice, gently instilled the values of bravery, genuineness, and selflessness in her young listeners, virtues that were her father's legacy.\n42) The film ends on a powerful note, highlighting that true heroism isn't about acquiring wealth or chasing fame but about what one is willing to sacrifice for the people and ideals they love.\n\nStory Arc Types:\n- Rags to Riches: Protagonist starts disadvantaged and ends better (e.g., 0\u21921\u21922\u21924\u219210)\n- Riches to Rags: Protagonist starts high and ends lower (e.g., 10\u21929\u21928\u21926\u21920)\n- Man in a Hole: Protagonist falls into trouble but recovers (e.g., 6\u21922\u21921\u21924\u219210)\n- Icarus: Protagonist rises then falls dramatically (e.g., 2\u21924\u21929\u21925\u21921)\n- Double Man in a Hole: Two cycles of fall and recovery (e.g., 6\u21922\u21927\u21924\u219210)\n- Cinderella: Rise, setback, ultimate triumph (e.g., 1\u21927\u21924\u21921\u219210)\n- Oedipus: Start high, fall, recover, final fall (e.g., 10\u21924\u21927\u21929\u21921)",
        "output": "### TASK 1: Identify the Protagonist and 5 Major Events\n\nThe protagonist in the story is Arthur Ascender.\n\nThe 5 major events in the story are:\n\n1. **Arthur discovers the weathered manuscript and becomes fascinated with the Serenity Orb** (sentences 5-6).\n2. **Arthur and his friends begin their journey to find the Serenity Orb** (sentences 17-18).\n3. **They reach the summit of Mt. Solitaire but fail to find the Serenity Orb** (sentences 22).\n4. **Arthur and his friends face a surprise assault in the Whispering Depths and John sacrifices himself** (sentences 32-33).\n5. **Arthur and Lucy use the Serenity Orb's healing powers to save Dovecliff and restore John's life** (sentences 35-38).\n\n### TASK 2: Describe the Protagonist's State at Each Event and Relative Changes\n\n1. **Arthur discovers the weathered manuscript**: Arthur's state is one of curiosity and fascination. He is a young boy with a sense of wonder and adventure. His state is relatively neutral, with a hint of excitement and anticipation.\n2. **Arthur and his friends begin their journey**: Arthur's state is now one of determination and resolve. He is driven by his desire to find the Serenity Orb and is willing to take risks to achieve his goal. His state has improved relative to the first event, as he is now more focused and motivated.\n3. **They reach the summit but fail to find the Serenity Orb**: Arthur's state is one of disappointment and frustration. He has faced numerous challenges and setbacks, and his failure to find the Serenity Orb is a significant blow. His state has worsened relative to the second event, as he is now facing uncertainty and doubt.\n4. **Arthur and his friends face a surprise assault**: Arthur's state is one of shock, fear, and grief. He has lost John, a close friend and mentor, and is facing a life-threatening situation. His state has worsened relative to the third event, as he is now facing a catastrophic loss.\n5. **Arthur and Lucy use the Serenity Orb's healing powers**: Arthur's state is one of relief, gratitude, and triumph. He has overcome incredible odds and has achieved his goal of finding the Serenity Orb. His state has improved significantly relative to the fourth event, as he is now experiencing a sense of redemption and closure.\n\n### TASK 3: Classify the Story Arc Type and Explain Reasoning\n\nBased on the protagonist's condition throughout the story, I would classify the story arc type as **Cinderella**.\n\nThe Cinderella story arc is characterized by a rise, a setback, and a final recovery. Arthur's state follows this pattern: he rises from a state of curiosity to one of determination, then faces a setback when he fails to find the Serenity Orb, and finally recovers when he finds the Orb and uses its healing powers to save Dovecliff.\n\nThe story also meets the criteria for a Cinderella arc in that Arthur's final state is higher than his initial state. He begins as a young boy with a sense of wonder and ends as a hero who has saved his village and demonstrated exceptional integrity.\n\n### TASK 4: Determined Story Arc Type\n\nCinderella"
